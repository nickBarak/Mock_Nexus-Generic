If you believe a factual error was made in a <span style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Daily Nexus</span> article, please call our office immediately. If a correction request is not made within a year of publication, it becomes exceedingly difficult for our staff to investigate your claim. As such, any request made after one year of publication will require the reader to provide the burden of proof.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        With regards to retraction requests, please know that these are rarely granted. For a retraction to occur, the article in question would have to contain more fallacy than fact or be wrong at its very core. As a newspaper, we are obligated to preserve these historical records. Once an issue is published, you cannot retract an opinion piece or a quote you willingly gave to a reporter. Police reports are also public record. We will not remove any article from our print or online editions unless severe factual errors have occurred. Personal reasons are not acceptable grounds for a retraction.\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li key=\"8\">\r\n                    <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: '.85rem' }}>\r\n                        How do I purchase an advertisement?\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        Interested parties can contact our advertising office by phone at (805) 893-3828 or email <span style={{ color: 'var(--link-hover)' }}>production@dailynexus.com.</span>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li key=\"9\">\r\n                    <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: '.85rem' }}>\r\n                        How do I pitch a story idea?\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        The <span style={{ fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Daily Nexus</span> has several desk editors who are assigned to specific sections.
