A series of sustained rains could be the only remedy for Southern California’s drought. <em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>For the past five years, Lake Cachuma has been shriveling in size as rain levels drop to historical lows, measured as the driest five years on record. Despite promises of heavy El Niño rains in 2016, the Santa Barbara area received only 70 percent of the expected precipitation, resulting in wildfires and rapidly diminishing reservoirs.</p>\n<p>Large amounts of rain at the beginning of 2017 left many hopeful for a swift end to California’s six-year drought. According to the Santa Barbara County Reservoir and Rainfall report, the county has received 135 percent of normal rainfall this year.</p>\n<p>Storms beginning this week may affect the drought classification in Santa Barbara; even large storms last week did not abate a D4 status which classifies Santa Barbara as in “exceptional drought.” The rest of the state, however, is down to two percent D4 conditions from over 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The National Weather Forecast estimated peak precipitation levels between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. the night of Jan. 18, when the county was projected to receive between 0.26 and 0.49 inches of rain. A second storm is expected to arrive Thursday evening and continue through mid-Friday with an estimated one to three inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The third and largest storm is expected to arrive Sunday, which at minimum will have as much precipitation as the storm before it.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, the deputy public works director for Santa Barbara County, said he feels “cautiously optimistic” about the upcoming storms’ effects on Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>“The drought’s not over, but a little bit of relief is good,” Fayram said. “We will see some inflow into Lake Cachuma; it stands to put water in the reservoir for the first time since 2011.”</p>\n<p>KK Holland, from the Goleta Water District, said, “The biggest potential impact will likely be not from local rainfall here, but an increased state water allocation due to the heavy rains in the northern part of the state.”</p>\n<p>Despite the seeming lack of impact, Holland said, the district is “obviously thrilled to see much needed rain.”</p>\n<p>The last drought report released Jan. 12 by the National Drought Mitigation Center showed “major changes were made” across California due to the increased precipitation this year, but water supply in Santa Barbara County still lags way below normal with a “measly” increase in Lake Cachuma.</p>\n<p>According to a report from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District released last week, Lake Cachuma was over 753 feet in elevation in 2011, and it stored over 193,300 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>Today, Lake Cachuma is at 651.79 foot elevation and is storing 17,757 acre-feet of water.</p>\n<p>This is only 9.2 percent of capacity, which is 193,305 acre-feet. In order for Santa Barbara to move down to D3, which means the area is in “extreme drought,” there would need to be more hydrological impact on Lake Cachuma, which fulfills around half the water needs of the South Coast.</p>\n<p>David Miskus, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and author of last week’s drought report, said, as far as “hydrological improvement,” Santa Barbara is “not very affected.”</p>\n<p>Tim DeVries, an assistant professor in the UCSB geography department, said the county will need double the expected rainfall in 2017 and 2018 to offset the drought. The average rainfall in 2016 was half the expected average, meaning an end to the drought would require four times that value for the next two years.</p>\n<p>“This year, we got 18 inches of rain, and what we’d need is essentially two consecutive years of 30 inches of rain,” DeVries said. “Right now, we’re perhaps on track for that this year, it’s kind of too early to say.”</p>\n<p>Much of the status of the drought will be contingent on February, which has historically been California’s wettest month.</p>\n<p>Goleta Water District declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency in May 2015, with a target of decreasing water usage by 35 percent. The district has imposed restrictions on outdoor watering, agricultural water usage and mandates that hotels and other lodging post notices of water shortage.</p>\n<p>Conservation in Goleta to date has been around 27 percent, though for some months conservation has been as high as 40 percent, with “single family consumers” conserving the most.</p>\n<p>According to Holland, the rainfall totals to date for the year are eight inches for Goleta.</p>\n<p>“That isn’t enough to offset the previous years of below average rainfall,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We are still early in the rainy season and the watershed is so dry that until this last storm, there wasn’t enough rain to get any inflow into the lake.”</p>\n<p>There are five different water shortage stages, with stage one requesting voluntary conservation and stage two beginning to mandate conservation, especially of outdoor watering.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amounts of rain, Holland said she remains pessimistic about the future of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The most recently released drought index shows the South Coast as one of the only remaining areas of the state to still be in exceptional drought,” she said in an email. “If anything, additional restrictions on outdoor watering may become necessary by summer.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether this drought is a symptom of human-caused climate change because of the relatively short time period; climate change is generally observed over the course of several decades.</p>\n<p>“If we go into a 30-year dry spell, then we can pretty much say, okay, this is climate change, this is not due to natural climate variability, this is human caused,” DeVries said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The position Bertrand is running for is the “alternate special district member” on the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees special districts in the county.</p>\n<p>As people move into cities, the LAFCO makes sure spaces remain open and resources are protected. An alternate member takes part in LAFCO affairs when the regular members cannot be present or need to recuse themselves. For each meeting attended, the member makes $150 without benefits.</p>\n<p>Bertrand secured the nomination with four “yes” votes, one “no” vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>If Bertrand had not voted for himself and instead abstained, he would not have received the nomination.</p>\n<p>The FPPC didn’t offer a direct opinion on the matter since “only an investigation determines whether violations have occurred.”</p>\n<p>“Generally speaking, the responsibility is on public officials to avoid conflicts,” Jay Wierenga, the FPPC communications director, said in an email. He went on to say officials are recommended by law to avoid “even the appearance” of conflicts.</p>\n<p>David Seymour, another nominee for the LAFCO position, did recuse himself when his special district, the Santa Ynez CSD, voted to nominate him. Seymour, a 14-year veteran of the Santa Ynez CSD, left the room while the vote took place.</p>\n<p>“I had to leave, I left, I recused myself,” Seymour told the <em>Nexus.</em> “I can’t vote for myself. By going to LAFCO, there’s financial conditions and so you can’t do that. That’s against the law.”</p>\n<p>At Tuesday’s CSD meeting, Bertrand introduced his intent to run for the vacant position on the Santa Barbara LAFCO. While fellow directors Robert Geis and George Thurlow immediately mentioned and seconded a motion to place him in the position, Bertrand faced hesitation from director Jay Freeman.</p>\n<p>Freeman told the board it should throw its support behind Seymour, citing Seymour’s experience in and around LAFCO through the years.</p>\n<p>To that end, Freeman noted LAFCO’s emphasis on nitty gritty aspects of the larger county and said it would look bad if the I.V. CSD nominated someone who hadn’t attended enough LAFCO meetings.</p>\n<p>Going for this position would spread Bertrand too thin, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“I like that you’re excited to do this, but it seems like a stretch given all you’re doing here,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand defended his qualifications, saying the LAFCO needs more younger folks and people of color in the way of diversity.</p>\n<p>He later told the <em>Nexus</em> that he has attended “quite a few” LAFCO meetings “over the past couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow stepped in, telling Bertrand to step down from facilitating the discussion since he had a direct interest in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Particularly, Thurlow said Bertrand should recuse himself from running the meeting, but “not necessarily from voting.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Bertrand stood by his decision to vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>“I still believe that what I did was within my rights and responsibilities,” he told the <em>Nexus</em>. “I’m still comfortable with it.”</p>\n<p>He directed the<em> Nexus</em> to the CSD’s legal counsel for further questions. G.

It is a right, along with … clean air, clean water, and protection from climate impacts,” Creasman said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The legislation will be used to combat the negative effects of California’s natural disasters including the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County last December and aid in relief for the Montecito floods, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the bond would fund the implementation of parks in disadvantaged neighborhoods as well as improve the facilities in existing parks, including those in I.V., according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is the lowest income area in the entire county. That sets us up to have priority access to have a lot of the grants that are going to be made available if this bond passes,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>I.V. would be eligible to receive one or more grants that could total up to $200,000 for park improvements. If the proposition is passed, this money could become available close to the end of the year, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>This bond would help California’s economy by increasing job opportunities within national park service in fields including environmental planning, construction and tourism, according to Katalina Vang, California Public Interest Research Group’s (CALPIRG) outreach coordinator at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG is a student-run environmental and political organization on campus at UC Santa Barbara that is advocating for Prop 68 to garner voter support.</p>\n<p>“Prop 68 is actually addressing global warming issues straightforwardly instead of abstractly and we finally are receiving solutions from government officials on how to solve these environmental issues,” Vang said in an email.</p>\n<p>The proposition’s passage would allow for future generations to better conserve the natural resources and guarantee a world that has usable resources, according to Vang.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure we build a foundation of saving our environment before it gets worse,” she said.</p>\n<p>Despite the number of political leaders and organizations that are in support of the proposition, several public figures openly oppose proposition 68 including Senator John Moorlach, Andrea Seastrand, President of the Central Coast Taxpayers Association and Jon Coupal, President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.</p>\n<p>Moorlach argued that the bond will do more harm than good because the government would need to raise taxes in order to pay off the money that would need to be borrowed for the measure.</p>\n<p>In an article written by Coupal, he refers to the Legislative Analyst Office report on Prop 68 that estimates that it will take $7.8 billion to pay off the bond: $4 billion in principal spending and $3.8 billion in interest rates.</p>\n<p>“It will take approximately $8 billion to pay off the $4 billion of borrowed funds. That means you can expect a tax increase. And your children can expect a tax increase. And your grandchildren can expect a tax increase,” Moorlach said in a press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/student-organizers-move-to-pass-prop-68-which-would-fund-i-v-parks/","id":3948,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[3947,3946,3945],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVRPD Appoints New Board Member for Seven-Month Term","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IVRPD-Web_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IVRPD-Web_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District appointed a new member to the board of directors at Thursday’s meeting after a nine-week long position vacancy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District appointed a new member to the board of directors at Thursday’s meeting after a nine-week long position vacancy.</p>\n<p>Celene Washington, a second-year sociology major, was selected to join the board for the seven-month term.
