It’s an integral opportunity for a team’s morale and mental toughness to be tested at its most vulnerable state. It has been nearly a month since the UCSB women’s volleyball team’s last victory, but the Gauchos remain adamant about their potential to contend in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Conference is long, and we play everyone twice. At this point half of us have wins, half of us have losses,” senior outside hitter Ali Barbeau said. “This early, anything can happen. We’re keeping our heads up and we know that we can come back.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to Santa Barbara in search of its first conference and home win of the season. At 4-8, the Gauchos hope to shake their seven-game losing streak in weekend bouts against Cal State Northridge tomorrow and No. 24 Cal State Long Beach on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_64910\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"936488736\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64916\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64910\" data-attachment-id=\"64910\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/eric_swenson_nexus_womens_vball_9-11_vs_smu_cropped_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Shauna Klein drops low to position herself for the dropping float serve.

During non-conference play, the Gauchos averaged a .206 hitting clip. However, in their conference opener, they achieved a dismal .121 hitting percentage. Since losing 3-1 to SMU, the Gauchos have not had two players record double digit kills in the same contest.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing is we just have to keep getting better,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “If we keep getting better, we’re going to start to see the results we want in terms of the scoreboard.”</p>\n<p>Despite having just one win prior to the start of Big West play, Northridge has triumphantly kicked off its conference schedule. The Matadors, now 3-11, are on a two-game winning streak after sweeping UC Irvine and a 3-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Through just two conference games, CSUN sits atop the Big West in various statistical categories. Northridge currently leads the conference in kills (110), kills per set (15.71), assists (100), assists per set (14.29), and points (135.0).</p>\n<p>Bearing the offensive torch for the Matadors is senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson. She has been a key centerpiece to CSUN’s progression as she leads the team in kills (182) and blocks (24). Stinson has recorded double-digit kills in nine of Northridge’s games, and just this past Monday was named Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week. A well-deserved honor, as Stinson is coming off a weekend in which she tallied a total of 39 kills and averaged 5.57 kills per set to compliment a smashing .423 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Molding into Northridge’s next elite star at the outside hitter position is freshman Aeryn Owens. Despite a meager .127 hitting average so far this season, she ranks second in CSUN’s kills total with 111. Since the award’s creation prior to the 2014 season, Owens became the first Matador to receive the Big West Freshman of the Week award after chalking up 29 kills and a .313 hitting percentage in the team’s first two conference matches.</p>\n<p>The reigning champions of the Big West Conference, Cal State Long Beach has its eyes set on a repeat performance of its undefeated, 16-0 conference record of last season. Currently 12-3, the 49ers are off to an emphatic start at 2-0 after last weekend’s home conference opener.</p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach’s determined foundation of players certainly helped pave the way for the 49ers’ success. Last season’s Big West Player of the Year, senior Jenelle Hudson became just the second setter in CSULB history to earn the award. She currently leads the Big West in assists with a total of 587 and sits second in assists per set with 10.30.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Ashley Murray was also recognized for her performance in last year’s remarkable run as she was the recipient of the 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year award. Aiding Murray at the middle blocker position is Ball State transfer, senior Hayley Benson. She recently earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week after tallying seven blocks and two blocks per set in the 49ers conference opener.</p>\n<p>Despite preparing for its second and third conference games of the season, the stakes are slowly heightening for UCSB as a win could reinvigorate the Gauchos’ hopes this season.</p>\n<p>“Right now our focus is first on CSUN and then we’ll look at Long Beach as well,” Lantagne Welch said. “It comes down to the process. Let’s put together what we did well this weekend and add a little bit more to it. We have the advantage of playing at home and the students are now back, and that could have a lot of stuff go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB versus Cal State Northridge will proceed at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Following the Gauchos’ Friday bout is their Saturday match versus No. 24 Cal State Long Beach. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-30/gauchos-remain-motivated-heading-into-conference-home-opener/","id":5098,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5097,5096,5095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Hawaii in Conference Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB dropped its second match of the Big West portion of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After riding a four-game winning streak into the weekend, the UCSB women’s water polo team fell short against No. 9 Hawaii in its tightly contested Big West home opener.

The Rainbow Wahine scored four goals in the first period compared to three by UCSB and eventually took a 7-4 lead into the half.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing first half defensively, the Gauchos put together their most impressive defensive half of the season.</p>\n<p>“In the second half our defense was really strong.

We are super young and just getting better every single game.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by one goal in the final seconds of regulation, UCSB was denied on two separate point-blank chances by Hawaii’s senior goalie Amy Carlson, preserving the win for the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>“We were very disappointed to lose this game but it showed us exactly what we need to improve on and how we can take on the coming teams,” Smith said. “We are confident going into our next game because each game we’re continuing to improve and working together really well.”</p>\n<p>With just three more conference games remaining this season, the Gauchos will now look forward to a match with No. 6 UC Irvine Anteaters, the team tied atop the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We learned a lot from this loss,” Hudson said. “If we run into Hawaii at [the Big West Championships], it’ll definitely be a different outcome.”</p>\n<p>The match with Irvine will begin at noon this Saturday at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-in-conference-match/","id":5095,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5094,5093,5092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Third Straight Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WomensWaterPoloCamerynBrock.jpg?resize=826%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to UC Irvine 6-3 and Long beach State 9-5.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 15 UCSB women’s water polo team entered the weekend disappointed about a home loss to No. 9 Hawaii the prior week and failed to redeem itself after falling to UC Irvine in a 6-3 loss on Saturday.

Trailing 8-4 heading into the final frame, the Gauchos ran out of time on their way to a 9-5 loss.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Samantha Murphy led UCSB with two goals against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>With just one game remaining in the regular season against No. 7 Cal State Northridge, the Gauchos aren’t worried about a 1-3 record in Big West games at this point.</p>\n<p>“We are confident that we will do well,” Martin said. “Everyone for the most part is pretty even. Going into conference we need to have the mindset that we have nothing to lose and we definitely have the potential to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home for its final match of the regular season against Northridge at 4 p.m. on Friday in Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-lose-third-straight-match/","id":5096,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5095,5094,5093],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inconsistencies Too Costly in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's volleyball opened its conference schedule with a road contest against No. 11 Hawai'i.

UCSB recorded a total of 17 attacking errors against the University of Hawaii’s six.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58068\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"169675182\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64882\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58068\" data-attachment-id=\"58068\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/weekend-sweep-places-ucsb-into-contention/w-volleyball-v-uc-irvine-by-eric-swenson_for-11-09-2014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=1200%2C807&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,807\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415480609\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"W Volleyball v UC Irvine by Eric Swenson_for 11.09.2014-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?fit=888%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58068\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-UC-Irvine-by-Eric-Swenson_for-11.09.2014-.jpg?resize=294%2C198\" alt=\"Senior oustide hitter Ali Barbeau attempting to make a block at the net.

We did that at times, we just didn’t sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Last season marked the end of the Rainbow Wahine’s illustrious streak of 19 consecutive conference championships, a winning stretch that combined their success in both the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Big West conferences, respectively. With this year’s pre-season prediction to earn a first-place finish in the Big West poll, it was a prominent first step for a Hawaii team that is determined to regain its conference notoriety. The Rainbow Wahine improved to 12-1 and are now 2-0 versus Big West opponents after sweeps of UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nearly 7,000 people filled Hawaii’s Stan Sheriff Center on Friday, indicating the long-awaited conference opener. Despite the daunting atmosphere, UCSB managed to hold its ground in the match’s beginning.</p>\n<p>A combination of kills, one service ace and one assisted block helped Santa Barbara go on an early 5-2 run. Still, a mentally well-equipped team like Hawaii did not panic as it rallied back with a 4-0 run of its own, taking a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s lead remained at a tight margin, but a kill by junior opposite Nikki Taylor triggered the team’s offensive surge to close the set. Up 15-12, Taylor’s attack sparked Hawaii’s 10-1 run to win the game’s first set, taking the 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the one-set deficit, UCSB continued to trade points with Hawaii in the opening of the second set. Yet, tied 7-7, Santa Barbra’s inability to limit its self-inflicted mistakes contributed to the Rainbow Wahine having a match-best .452 hitting clip. Hawaii surely benefited from its attacking success as it went on two 6-0 runs, the second scoring spurt gave the Rainbow Wahine a 23-12 lead. Helping capture the 25-14 set win were two kills by junior setter Tayler Higgins and sophomore middle hitter Emily Maglio.</p>\n<p>UCSB remained motivated in its quest to trim Hawaii’s lead. While the Gauchos’ ongoing errors persisted in the match’s last set, their offense improved to a team-high .258 hitting percentage. Three different Gauchos tallied a total of six kills, while sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman led UCSB in kills for the fourth straight match with seven.</p>\n<p>Still, Hawaii’s outstanding hitting stretch continued as it registered a .433 clip. Leading the Rainbow Wahine was an imposing performance by Higgins. Last week’s espnW Player of the Week, Higgins tallied a match-high 14 kills to go along with a .464 hitting night.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii outhit UCSB, freshman libero Emilia Petrachi logged a match-high 19 digs. However, it was Santa Barbara’s insufficiency at the net that plagued its defense. While UCSB had no blocking errors, the Gauchos blocked just six of Hawaii’s attacking attempts. Not only were the Rainbow Wahine able to capitalize offensively, but they also strived on defense with a total of 19 blocks. In addition to Maglio’s eight kills and .615 hitting clip, she notched a match-high of six blocks to help Hawaii win the final set, 25-19.</p>\n<p>Certainly the Rainbow Wahines’ performance on both sides of the net must be acknowledged, but UCSB’s errors proved too costly against a powerhouse program like Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I think Hawaii is a great team. They have no real weakness and they had a huge size advantage on us,” Lantagne Welch said. “I actually thought we played better than the score indicated. If you hit .300 against just about any team you’re gonna win. We just didn’t put enough pressure on them or their offense. We didn’t serve tough at all and we let them off the hook that way.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Friday, Oct. 2nd to host its conference home opener versus Cal State Northridge at 7:00 p.m. UCSB continues its home stand with a match versus No. 25 Long Beach State on Saturday, Oct. 3rd at 7:00 p.m. as well.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/gauchos-inconsistencies-too-costly-in-conference-opener/","id":5097,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5096,5095,5094],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
