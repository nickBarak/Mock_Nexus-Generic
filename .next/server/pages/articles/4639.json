She says she was motivated to retire so she could spend more time with family.</em> Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr announced Friday she will not seek a third term after December 2016.</p>\n<p>Farr has served on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors since 2009, representing Santa Ynez, Goleta and Isla Vista. While in office, Farr secured $480,000 of county funding for an I.V. Community Center and $10.3 million for the Pescadero Lofts, which provide housing and services for I.V.’s houseless population. Farr has also supported Assemblymember Das Williams’ recently signed Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which will create Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. if approved by residents.</p>\n<p>Farr said she decided to end her time in office because she is feeling “the pull of family.”</p>\n<p>“My sister passed away in the spring. She was my only sibling. She was four years younger than I was. That was a real blow and continues to be a real blow,” Farr said. “My mother — now I’m the only child she has and she’s 88 years old, and also since I’ve been in office, I’ve had two grandchildren born.”</p>\n<p>Farr said she originally ran for office in 2008 because colleagues told her she was apt for the position.</p>\n<p>“I got to thinking about it, and I thought, well, maybe I do have a unique background … I obviously didn’t know whether I’d be elected or not,” Farr said. “I’d never run for any public office before, and so that was quite an experience.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career began when she presented a proposal to the Board of Supervisors to build sidewalks and stop signs in the then unincorporated area of Goleta. According to Farr, she then led two different neighborhood community groups, one in Goleta and one later in the Santa Ynez Valley. She then became Second District Planning Commissioner of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I’ve lived in the county for almost four decades now, first in the south coast and now in the Santa Ynez Valley, kind of gave me a unique background,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr says one of her “legacies to the district” will be securing funding to open the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s certainly a project that is personally close to my heart, and I’m glad that we were able to keep going and secure the funding,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Farr’s support for AB 3 in her role as Chair of Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a state-mandated agency that typically oversees the development of CSDs, was essential to the development and progress of the bill.</p>\n<p>“She came to Sacramento to testify during our first committee hearing and was able to effectively attest to the real challenges of Isla Vista in their quest for self-governance,” Williams said in an email. “Also, as chair of LAFCO during this process, Supervisor Farr has been a voice of reason, encouraging a compromise where LAFCO could be involved in the formation of the CSD while understanding why the community wouldn’t want to leave it totally in their hands.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who has worked with Farr since she assumed office, said Farr is a “consummate professional.”</p>\n<p>“She’s always extremely well-prepared, and she and I don’t agree on everything, but I’ve always respected her positions. She’s always had a very well-thought-out position, and I’m really going to miss working with her,” Lavagnino said. “I haven’t heard of anybody who’s talking about running, but it is absolutely the most difficult district in the five to represent … she’s got a very difficult job and I think she’s done extremely well.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of External Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said she has worked with Farr on a number of projects, including the recent appointment of Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr managed to get funding for our community service deputy — [I believe] that was $114,000,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, Farr’s work in support of AB 3 will not come to fruition without sufficient funding for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I totally support self-governance for Isla Vista,” Lavagnino said. “The problem is if you don’t have a funding stream to handle that — I don’t think that the students understand exactly how much it costs to provide sidewalks and those kinds of things that supervisor Farr’s been working diligently on for the last years.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she appreciates that Farr has made significant contributions to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am really proud and honored to have been able to work with her, and I think all of our community is thankful for the amount of work she’s put into Isla Vista, the amount of money that she’s been able to get for our community,” Dela Cruz said. “The last thing I’d like to say to her is just thank you, thank you for your hard work.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career has been rewarding, but she is grateful for the opportunity she now has to spend time with her family.</p>\n<p>“When you get into your 60s and your friends are starting to retire and you just start thinking that there are other things that are important to do,” Farr said. “Being the Third District County Supervisor is absolutely an incredible job [and] opportunity — it’s an honor and a privilege every day to have been chosen by the voters to do this very important work that shapes county policy, [and] shapes land use.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 10 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students. Learning and teaching is a truly special endeavor, and for something like that to happen is an assault to the core of who we are.”<br>\nGaskin said she hopes to travel after her retirement.</p>\n<p>“I want to have the time to travel,” Gaskin said. “I’ve never taken a trip in the 35 years in September or October. It would be so unusual to travel then.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/","id":4636,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4635,4634,4633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Halloween Parking Restrictions and Noise Ordinances Discussed at City of Goleta Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The City of Goleta hosted a community meeting to discuss residential parking permits and noise ordinances for Halloween weekend in Isla Vista Thursday evening at Goleta City Hall.

At the meeting, community members discussed possible solutions to these issues, mainly temporary noise ordinance and parking permits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Police Department Lieutenant Mark Signa said the influx of vehicles during Halloween weekend has affected locals in past years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parking has been a difficult thing for people who come out into the area and park in Goleta and take up valuable space that the residents are using,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta and UCSB have collaborated to ensure that parking is available for I.V. residents and the students through a temporary permit system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta area’s restricted the parking to those who have permits, and the permits are given to the residents in the area,” Signa said. “Each resident, from Hollister Avenue to Southern Limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road, get two permits and can request more at the Neighborhood Service Department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said the City of Goleta will implement a parking restriction from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Oct. 30 to Nov. 2, with restrictions on parts of Del Playa, Sabado Tarde, Trigo, Camino Del Sur, Camino Pescadero and El Embarcadero starting at 5 p.m. on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, UCSB will offer discounted campus parking permits for those who wish to purchase one in preparation for Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What they’ve done to mitigate the problem with students living on Del Playa is that they’ve offered the students an opportunity to buy night weekend permits at a reduced rate, so they actually get a permit they can use for the rest of the year,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino said a noise ordinance will help ensure parties to not reach unmanageable levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been studies done that show that the sooner you shut down the music the sooner the party is over,” Plastino said. “As you close that gap between the times you allow it to the time you shut it down, you lessen the amount of drunken violence and fights that break out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Signa, the parking permit program and noise ordinance are intended to make Halloween a local event for I.V. residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this has been very successful at doing is instead of creating large, open parties with two, three or five hundred people showing up and music blasting, it’s now smaller contained parties, local parties, where students are having parties with just their friends, smaller groups, hence less alcohol, less problems,” Signa said. “By keeping it local it stays contained.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Butch Arnoldi said many people who visit I.V. for Halloween do not respect the local community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately people that are not from the area come up here and think that’s it free game for all kinds of assaults, physical assaults and sexual assaults,” Arnoldi said. “This is not the old west, people can’t come here from out of town and brutalize our people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa said approximately 200 law enforcement officials will patrol I.V. during Halloween weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement for Isla Vista is going to consist of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s department, UCSB police department and we’re each going to have different areas that we’re going to be patrolling,” Signa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta Neighborhood Services and Public Safety Director Vytautas “Vyto” Adomaitis said the City of Goleta developed a parking permit program with community input and has received “overwhelming support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the feedback we got from the residents was, in fact, to do something about having permit parking in the area to help keep all of the outside visitors who come into the neighborhood and flood the area with vehicles,” Adomaitis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adomaitis said the City of Goleta will keep working to decrease the impact of Halloween weekend in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ll be reviewing these measures

the events leading to Andres Esteban Sanchez’s death on Sunday morning:</span></p>\n<p>“On October 11, 2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., the Santa Barbara County Fire Department received a call for a medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road in Isla Vista. Fire Engine 11, which was staffed with one Captain, one Paramedic/Engineer and one Paramedic/Firefighter, was dispatched and responded from their station located at 6901 Frey Way (at Storke Rd.) in Goleta. Upon arrival, Firefighters were met by several agitated bystanders stating that the subject had cut his arm and needed help. Firefighters donned the appropriate protective equipment and approached the subject, where they found a combative male victim, around 20 years of age, being restrained on the ground by Sheriff’s Deputies who had arrived on scene prior to our arrival.</p>\n<p>Our Captain and Engineer assisted with restraining the subject, who was extremely combative, while the Paramedic/Firefighter began treatment and worked to control the bleeding. An American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance arrived on scene. The subject was placed onto a back board and restrained with soft restraints to prevent further injury to himself or to first responders. He was then transferred to the AMR ambulance and transported without delay to Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Our Firefighter/Paramedic rode to the hospital in the ambulance to assist with patient care. The Captain and Engineer remained on scene, at the request of Sheriff’s Deputies, to assist with cleanup at three different locations on Abrego Road. There was a large amount of blood on the street at these locations, which presented a biological hazard. The areas were cleaned with the use of Septisol and copious amounts of water.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Firefighters pride themselves in their professionalism while working with law enforcement and AMR to provide the highest standard of patient care. Our members treat every emergency with urgency and professionalism. Engine 11’s crew on October 11<sup>th</sup> included an experienced team of Firefighters and Paramedics. Every effort was made to provide the very best care and life saving measures for this young man.”</p>\n<p><em>For the original allegations:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/","id":4638,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4637,4636,4635],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
