the second spot is up for grabs following Director Celine Washington’s decision to leave the board, announced by Lopez during the same meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, Bernard said she has confidence in Grange’s capability, especially with the projects he can bring to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I see a lot of potential with Whit, with a lot of projects that include the community garden, including all different types of groups from the community,” Bernard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange first learned about the opening through his work developing the </span><a href=\"http://www.islavistamethodist.com/edible-garden-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community garden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University United Methodist Church on the corner of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange said his previous work in I.V. has familiarized himself with the area and invested in him a significance for I.V. parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of college students don’t really see I.V. as much of a community at all, but the parks are a space where people can come together and neighbors can meet each other,” Grange said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a new director, Grange said he wants to focus on local community-based projects. Grange said community gardens, local government and being a part of the community are what he enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange hopes to learn more about the process of achieving projects in the community and “seeing how that project culminates and how funding is pulled together and how staff works with board members, works with the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone has an idea for a project in their community or if someone has some sort of vision they want to accomplish, the process for something like that, start to finish, is really cool,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just how all these different things come together because there’s so many parts in play, it’s almost mind boggling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange plans to work on several projects, including the expansion of Estero Gardens and the development of the new community center set to open in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Grange hopes to see more students come out and interact with some of the more permanent residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most students view I.V. as a transitory place. Something you hear a lot with graduating people is like, ‘Oh yeah I’m over I.V.’ or whatever. People just have a certain idea over what the culture is in I.V. and don’t really try to explore beyond that,” Grange said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be cool to see people just meeting more of their neighbors and walking around with their headphones in less often.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Carbajal is running for a third term re-election for the seat he first won in 2016. He currently serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, of which he serves as the vice chair. Carbajal has sponsored 231 bills since his inauguration in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UCSB graduate, Carbajal previously served for 12 years as the Santa Barbara County 1st District Supervisor. One of Carbajal’s main issues is environmental protection; he serves on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Solutions Caucus, which aims to find bipartisan solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbjal has also been a strong supporter of pro-immigration legislation, fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA. </span></p>\n<p><b>Andrew Caldwell (Republican):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caldwell’s campaign is centered on providing better opportunities for workers and small businesses. In 1991, he founded the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business (COLAB), which now has 1,000 members in Santa Barbara County. He has also helped start similar COLAB groups in Imperial, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties. While Caldwell is running as a Republican, he told the Santa Maria Times in February that neither party is serving the needs of the people and that he would “represent the people here.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Kenneth Young (No Party Preference): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young’s background is in civil engineering. According to his website, two issues that prompted him to run for office are health care and tax issues. He believes that Congress needs to lower costs for working families in order to maintain a healthy workforce in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue Young has put at the forefront of his campaign is energy independence; he said he believes the United States should invest more funding in renewable energy research and find safer ways of dealing with nuclear waste rather than eliminating nuclear power altogether. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Assembly:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Charles W. Cole (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cole, the sole Republican candidate running for State Assembly and the youngest among all candidates at 22, is running on a conservative platform that includes fixing freeways, preserving Proposition 13, maintaining private health care and rolling back rent control, according to his campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Cole graduated from Santa Barbara High School and attended Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to study business, but left after his first year after he found “the PC culture not conducive to learning,” according to his campaign website. His father manages his campaign, which has roughly $10,000 in donations from friends and family. He currently works for a local PR business, according to a Noozhawk</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Elsa Granados (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados, executive director of the nonprofit Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, is running on a three-fold platform that includes social equality advocacy, women’s rights advocacy and preserving the environment and coastlines along the Central Coast, according to her campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she wins the seat, Granados told the Santa Maria Times that she would work to increase affordable housing, create more jobs, strengthen the education systems within the district and stop offshore drilling.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A longtime UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista community member,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud, the youngest Democrat in the race for assembly, is the current general manager for the Isla Vista Community Services District and board member on the SBCC Board of Trustees.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud is running on a platform of education reform and free tuition, universal health care, affordable housing and public transportation, criminal justice reform and support for indigeneous communities, according to his campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cathy Murillo (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Santa Barbara City mayor, a former journalist and city councilmember, Murillo is running on a platform that aims to preserve the environment, increase access to higher education and strengthen the middle class, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first term as the mayor of Santa Barbara, Murillo worked to ban single-use plastics, set a 100% renewable energy goal by 2030 and continued to employ integrated pest management in the city. She also negotiated a project labor agreement with the city for worker safety and fair pay, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jason Dominguez (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez is bringing his experience as an environmental lawyer and a former teacher to his campaign, advocating for greater response to climate change, according to his website. Dominguez has previously served as a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and Deputy City Attorney, and he has been on Santa Barbara City Council since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez was originally running for Assembly at the same time as re-election for the Santa Barbara City Council but lost the election in December 2019. If elected, he plans to expand his work from City Council on inclusionary housing and wants to create a rent-to-own program for tenants. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steve Bennett (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Supervisor Bennett is finishing his fifth term on the board; before that, he worked as a high school teacher and member of the Ventura City Council. One of his hallmark initiatives of the County Board of Supervisors is S.O.A.R., the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiative, which was recently re-ratified. Other key issues for Bennett include building affordable housing and alternative transportation, such as coastal bikeways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bennett recently received the endorsement of the Santa Barbara Independent, who said he “holds the dramatic edge of experience” and will advocate for environmental protection. </span></p>\n<p><b>Stephen Blum (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing himself as a “proud product of public schools,” Blum was a teacher for over 20 years before he served on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and California Community College League State Board. Blum is basing his campaign on small donors and not accepting donations over $100 from any individuals or groups in what he calls a “positive only” campaign, he said on his website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dawn Addis (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addis serves on the Morro Bay City Council and said on her website that her work as a mother, public educator and community organizer guides her actions. She is supportive of climate crisis legislation, aiming to address the climate crisis by expanding clean renewable energy sources. She also aims to increase jobs and small business growth, according to her campaign’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3rd District Supervisor:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Joan Hartmann </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Democrat): As the incumbent, Hartmann has been serving as the 3rd District representative — which contains Isla Vista, parts of Goleta, the Gaviota Coast and Santa Ynez — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has been a strong advocate for climate change legislation. Isla Vista counts for nearly a third of the population living within the district.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, Hartmann discussed how the Santa Barbara oil spill inspired her to enter into academia, then law and then into the role of Supervisor. She placed importance on UCSB faculty housing, said she is a “huge supporter” of unionized labor and supports regulated cannabis within the county. She has also worked with several members of the Isla Vista Community Services District, supported the creation of the district and has been endorsed by several directors as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bruce Porter: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Porter’s second time running for the 3rd District seat. He is running on a platform of investing in alternative energy, “[restoring] balance to county government,” reinvesting in public schools and implementing a “common sense” cannabis policy, according to </span><a href=\"http://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter has faced significant backlash in the past few months from Isla Vista residents and UCSB students for his alleged role in the creation of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/rock-the-vote-sb-declared-illegitimate-by-national-org-shuts-down-operations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization that allegedly was created to tip the scales in the supervisor race by causing low voter turnout. He did not attend the Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, bowing out of the forum four hours before it was set to begin, citing mismanagement on the part of the forum’s organizers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Karen Jones (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Jones’ second time running for the 3rd District seat, and she currently serves as a director on the Santa Ynez Community Services District.

id=\"caption-attachment-87716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The change to the I.V. CSD’s elections year was approved on April 9. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mailers were recently distributed to I.V. residences to notify voters of the change, announcing that the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) would now hold its elections during the statewide general election beginning on Nov. 3, 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining the district’s election with the general election is a change that would save the district approximately $83,000 this year alone, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said at the district’s Jan. 8 meeting, during which the district voted to petition for the election year change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positions on the board were previously up for election during odd-numbered years because the I.V. CSD </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially formed in March of 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even though it was voted into existence in the 2016 general election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the CSD was created by the voters, it was with the intent to elect Board Members during even year elections,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that in 2018, the county elections office informed the I.V. CSD that the district could not conduct an election for board members in the 2018 midterm general elections, “citing a quirk in State election law.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Elections Code 10505 </span><a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10505.&amp;lawCode=ELEC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mandates </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that “if the district is formed in an odd-numbered year, the officers elected at the formation election shall hold office until noon on the first Friday in December of the next following odd-numbered year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renee Bischof, chief deputy registrar of voters for Santa Barbara County, reached out in early January to Abboud to inform him that </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-10404.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Code 10404</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would allow the I.V. CSD to petition the Board of Supervisors for the change, Abboud said at the Jan. 8 CSD meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bischof also told Abboud that all other special districts in the county had already moved their elections to even-numbered years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $83,000 the district will save amounts to almost 10% of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/i-v-csd-tax-nets-half-a-million-less-than-estimated/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD’s total budget.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said it would cost between $93,000 to $98,000 for I.V. CSD to hold its own election in an odd-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district would still spend some money in the 2020 election but would not spend nearly as much as they would holding their own election. Abboud cited the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 2018 Measure R election</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which the district paid $11,000, as an example of cost-saving during an even-numbered year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The research is conclusive that even-year elections allow public agencies to spend fewer tax dollars conducting elections, and foster more democratic participation,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the county calculated the savings estimate by tallying the number of registered voters in I.V. and applying a cost of approximately $1.50 to each one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three positions on the board of directors will now be up for grabs in the 2020 general election, as opposed to fall 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those positions are currently held by Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Director Ethan Bertrand and Director Kristie Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen’s and Hedges’s seats will also be extended from two-year terms to four-year terms in the 2020 election, per Government Code section </span><a href=\"https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-61250.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61250(e)(1)(A)(i)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seat currently held by Bertrand will continue to be a two-year term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt and Director Jay Freeman, who originally ran for four-year terms, will have their terms extended from Dec. 2021 to Dec. 2022. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

He graduated from UCSB in 2014 with a degree in political science and completed a master’s degree in technology management in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a long-term I.V. resident who has been in the college town since 2010, Abboud’s roots extend beyond the university; he was integral to the campaign that created Isla Vista’s first local government and secured funding for Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and has served as the government’s general manager since Nov. 2017. He also currently serves as a member of the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees and has held the position since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an interview that for the past five years, he’s been “working on strengthening democracy in my town,” referencing his work on the Measures E, F and R campaigns to create and fund the I.V. CSD respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot in the past nine years to contribute to the community and learn about state issues and engage with issues that affect the local and state level,” he said. “I want to take what I’ve learned of how democracy can be different here to the state level and take our values to apply to the whole state.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But his latest venture to the statewide level was brought on by “imminent issues” affecting all Californians, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He cited “continued divestment in education,” “climate change” and “strengthening our democracy” as reasons for why he has decided to enter the race now. He added that he is the “only candidate in the race right now who has experience in the education sector.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud did not list any concrete points he would tackle if elected, and declined to further elaborate on his platform, stating he is “getting [his] campaign organization together.” He also declined to name his campaign managers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My philosophy as a candidate is that we all prosper only when everyone prospers,” he said. “There’s a lot of work we need to do about strengthening our democracy and making sure people can fully participate.” </span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
