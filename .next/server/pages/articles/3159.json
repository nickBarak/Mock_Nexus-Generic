Voting will be accessible through GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major and current Student Advocate General, said he would promote transparency and student outreach within the association.</p>\n<p>“Most students have no clue about what A.S. is doing on campus or where their funds are going,” Weber said. “We need to streamline the information being sent out to our student population and provide a monthly or weekly report about where those fees are going.”</p>\n<p>Weber said he would also seek to confront a recent trend of student apathy.</p>\n<p>“There are significantly more people at the undie run every quarter than at the budget rallies and protests,” Weber said. “Gaucho spirit does exist, we just need to channel it so we can tackle big issues, like the budget cuts.”</p>\n<p>Democratic Process Party candidate Stanley Tzankov, a third-year political science major and current off-campus representative, said he would work to implement the “core four” ideas at the heart of DPP’s plans for A.S.</p>\n<p>“I will create solutions that make the most of our resources, utilize the Office of the President to organize projects and programs to reach out to our students, work on student retention rates and engage the administration, student body and local government to all work together, especially in this time of budget cuts,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Tzankov said his work reaching out to marginalized students prepared him well for the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>“The budget cuts over the last few years have hit the disadvantaged and minority population very hard; it can be seen in the retention rates,” Tzankov said. “I have worked on providing an emergency loan service to disadvantaged and financially marginalized students. As president, I will appoint a Commissioner of Diversity and Equity who would plan events work on publicity.”</p>\n<p>Bettering Our School System’s candidate Marcus Rochellle, a third-year political science major and current finance board member, said he would work on the smaller issues on campus as well as addressing major budget concerns.</p>\n<p>“I believe it’s important to address the issues around campus as well as the bigger budget issues,” Rochellle said. “Improving the way we register for classes and expanding the wireless internet on campus are ways we can take measurable steps to improve lives on a day-to-day basis.”</p>\n<p>Rochellle said student collaboration will be critical for devising realistic solutions to break the cycle of budget cuts that disadvantage UC students.</p>\n<p>“The greatest untapped resource on campus is the students,” Rochellle said. “We need to harness the passion and spirit of the student body to address these issues with a unified front. We can let the state legislature know how much money we can make as graduates of college and how higher education really benefits the state.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/","id":3159,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3158,3157,3156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao","biography":"Not available","articles":[3097,3159],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

The council also voted down a resolution condemning a racially themed party organized by a UC Irvine fraternity last November.</p>\n<p>Finance Board chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board slashed next year’s budget from $672,496 to $400,695 in order to accommodate three new advisors and one part-time position.</p>\n<p>According to Lieberknecht, if every Boards, Committees and Commissions’ budget was fully allocated next year, finance board would be left with a $300,000 deficit in its unallocated fund.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that A.S. does not have money — because it does — but we need to account for the growth of positions because we are still receiving the same amount of money,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Lieberknecht said the budget should signify the association’s priorities.</p>\n<p>“Cuts are inevitable at every level of the budget process,” Lieberknecht said. “We had to make cuts, the president is going to have to make cuts and [Leg Council] is going to have to make cuts.”</p>\n<p>The budget is currently under review by A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez and will be made public within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lieberknecht said BCCs have been breaking the A.S. Constitution by funding Office of Student Life groups’ travel expenses and over $500 for food without administering one-time exceptions.</p>\n<p>“When BCCs are funding OSL groups there is a lot of policy-breaking and it’s usually not caught until it gets to admin and it’s already passed through minutes and Leg Council,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Alfredo Del Cid, university-owned housing representative, suggested developing a uniform process for requesting finances.</p>\n<p>“I think it would help if there was a streamlined process for funding,” Del Cid said. “I’ve been to multiple committee meetings and some have you give a form to the treasurer and some just bring it up in meetings.”</p>\n<p>The council decided not to condemn the actions of Irvine’s Phi Kappa Psi that held a Pilgrims and Indians -themed party last year.</p>\n<p>Del Cid, who authored the resolution, said the UCI administration still hasn’t taken action against the frat.</p>\n<p>“This is not an attack on the fraternity, but on the action,” Del Cid said. “We’re not telling them what to do, but that we stand in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>However, Yeni Nguyen, off-campus representative, said the council has no reason to target this specific party.</p>\n<p>After the resolution failed, Off-Campus Representative Amanda Berry said future resolutions should address all parties of this nature.</p>\n<p>“If we’re going to take a stand on this, then take a stand and make it general that ‘We don’t support any parties that do this’ instead of ‘We don’t support this particular party that had this specific theme,’” Berry said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/","id":3156,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3155,3154,3153],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also talked about problems within the council maintaining healthy attendance at meetings.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, A.S. associate director for community affairs, said the Isla Vista Community Collaborative — composed of parents, teachers and groups that tackle issues facing local children of kindergarten age and older — conducted extensive research revealing that local children don’t have access to nutritious food.</p>\n<p>“The collaborative did a survey on access to healthy food and the results were eye-opening,” Jones said. “There are zero supermarkets, no farmer’s markets, three small markets — one of which is called Keg-N-Bottle — and 19 fast food outlets.”</p>\n<p>However, Jones said the sustainable café with local, organic and free trade food that A.S. plans to open next school year on Pardall Road could provide families in I.V. with healthier food options.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Alfredo Del Cid, on the other hand, said low-income families won’t be able to afford food served at an organic eatery.</p>\n<p>“When we talked about the restaurant, every time I hear organic and healthy then comes the conversation of it being more expensive,” Del Cid said. “It’s easier for me to go and get two tacos for $0.99 than to buy an organic meal. I would like to have a conversation about this because Dan [La Berge] who drafted the plan did say it would be more expensive and I want to talk about how we can make it more affordable for these families.”\tAdditionally, the council discussed the transportation dilemma for local families who cannot afford automobiles face.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said Environmental Affairs Board could potentially offer free bicycles that would provide low-income families easier access to supermarkets in Goleta and Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Last year EAB set up a special auction with [the Community Service Organization] and bought bikes and then taught families how to fix them up and then gave them the bikes,” Mayville said. “CSO impounds thousands of bikes that are just abandoned every year on campus so we should do something with them.”</p>\n<p>Jones also said youths growing up in I.V. are often negatively influenced by college students’ lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“The living style in I.V. is an issue too,” Jones said. “There are very young youths developing substance abuse problems because they are drinking what is left in bottles that they pick up for recycling with families.”</p>\n<p>The board also debated at length problems facing the council, including members’ poor attendance and inattentiveness during public comment sessions.</p>\n<p>Del Cid said he couldn’t remember a single meeting that was attended by all elected representatives.</p>\n<p>“I understand that things happen and sometimes people can’t make it to meetings,” Del Cid said. “It says in our bylaws though that after school, this is our first priority. So be accountable; we’re not kids.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/","id":3157,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3156,3155,3154],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Spring Election forums will continue next Tuesday through Thursday and students can vote for candidates and lock-in fees on GOLD from April 18 to 21.</p>\n<p>Mostafa and Madarang discussed budget cuts, giving a voice to underrepresented student groups and proposed expanding student lobbying efforts in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>If elected, Mostafa said his main goal would be protecting students’ accessibility to higher education.</p>\n<p>“I see in this room a group of students that all share a common goal: to get an affordable, quality education,” Mostafa said. “My overarching goals are to unify the student body, staff and administrators. These budget cuts affect us all and together we can all mobilize over the common goal of protecting our educations. We need to tell legislatures true stories of how budget cuts have affected students and make our stories truly heard.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she plans to promote student involvement in UC Board of Regents decisions.</p>\n<p>“I would like to expand lobbying efforts both at the capital and in the local area to make sure that money goes to our school system,” Madarang said. “Students should be in the forefront of every decision made on this campus. There should be another student seat on the Regents so that we have more representation in decisions made for us by the UC Regents.”</p>\n<p>Mostafa said he would also strive to make the EVPSA office more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“I want every student to know what the office is and that every student can come in and be exposed to it,” Mostafa said. “I would restructure positions and create positions that advocate for student groups on campus that are underrepresented on [Associated Students] such as the engineering department and the Greek community. I want a campus that knows what the EVPSA office is and a campus that participates in our events.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she fears that California Governor Jerry Brown’s budget cuts will make a UC education unaffordable in the future.</p>\n<p>“[Tuition increases] would make a college education unattainable for many students,” Madarang said. “I have successfully lobbied Gavin Newsom’s staff and other governing bodies and would encourage students to become involved in protecting their education.”</p>\n<p>Audience member Tiffany Mayville, an off-campus representative and fourth-year environmental studies major, said the election forums reveal how prepared each candidate is for his or her prospective position.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes students come forward and want a position, but don’t know what the office really entails,” Mayville said. “Forums show us whether a candidate knows the position they’re running for and therefore how well they’ll do in that position.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/","id":3158,"author":{"id":215,"name":"Christina Lavingia"},"related":[3157,3156,3155],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
