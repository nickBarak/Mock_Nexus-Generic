With a bottle of Andre’s sparkling wine in one hand and a cigar in the other, the sunglass-clad 18-year-old was too cool for his own good. The officers stopped the hipster and asked his age. After briefly hesitating, he told the officers he was 21.</p>\n<p>The deputies weren’t fooled, however, and asked to see his ID. The champagne sipper reached for his wallet, paused and then decided it was better to just run. Wine still in hand, he pushed past the officers and sprinted onto DP.</p>\n<p>The officers immediately gave chase, and even tried to taser the sprinting bro, though unsuccessfully. The deputies did manage to spot him zipping into a backyard on Sabado Tarde, and after some cunning police work, officers apprehended the inebriated young man.</p>\n<p>The deputies then escorted him to their patrol car and drove him toward the Santa Barbara County Jail. While in transit, the defeated SBCC student spontaneously told the officers that he only ran because he thought he was going to be arrested. Officers promptly informed him that he would have only received a citation.</p>\n<p>“So you mean I would have just gotten a ticket?” asked the dismayed reveler just before being booked into the jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Forget to Flush<br>\nSun., May 3, 2:56 a.m. – Employees working the Saturday night shift at Silvergreens Restaurant were all set to go home when they found a surprise in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There, slouched over the toilet, lay a young woman sound asleep. Attempts to rouse her proved ineffective and the tired-eyed employees instead sought the help of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived some minutes later and were led into the bathroom. There the officers found the 20-year-old sleeping blissfully upon the white ceramic seat, her hair mussed and her pants still around her ankles. She had, it appeared, fallen asleep in the act of peeing.</p>\n<p>So intoxicated was the UCSB student, however, that it took the officers several minutes to wake her from her drunken stupor. Only after lifting her head and vigorously shaking her arm did she even respond.</p>\n<p>Having finally succeeded in rousing her, the deputies attempted to retrieve some basic information. The sloppy sleeper, however, was unable to form coherent words and instead took to spitting repeatedly on the floor.</p>\n<p>With that, the officers arrested the drunken squatter. She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hurricane<br>\nMon., May 11, 12:42 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to 6690 Abrego Rd. on reports that a heavily tattooed man was wreaking havoc at the apartment complex.</p>\n<p>A result copious amounts of alcohol and too much testosterone, the inebriated man was a walking disaster. According to the reporting party, the 23-year-old had been breaking glass bottles and smashing bikes, apparently just for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>When the deputies arrived, they found the San Jose native with his pants down urinating on the door to an apartment. The pugnacious pisser was cognizant enough to notice the officers, however, and quickly sucked up the pain and turned off the nozzle.</p>\n<p>Having easily found their suspect, the deputies took a moment to check their surroundings. It was as if a tornado had ripped through the apartment complex, with broken glass strewn in every corner and several bikes submerged in the pool.</p>\n<p>Despite being the only person in the vicinity, the self-professed musician adamantly denied having caused any of the destruction. The officers weren’t fazed and arrested the man anyway.</p>\n<p>He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-13/police-blotter-40/","id":3851,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3850,3849,3848],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The City of Love?<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 10:20 p.m. – Love may well have been in the air Saturday night, but so too was the familiar smell of alcohol-laden partiers.</p>\n<p>Deputies working the Valentine’s Day shift were pulled away from their romantic dreams when a clearly intoxicated individual stumbled out of the apartment complex at 6653 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old – who was, not surprisingly, alone and completely hammered – was having a difficult time navigating the parking lot. The officers watched as he stumbled into a parked car, then into a filthy dumpster, back into another parked car and finally out onto the street. There, the pinball wizard continued to run into cars, nearly eating it with every step.</p>\n<p>Stepping in, the deputies contacted the lonely partier and escorted him to the curb. There they tried to talk to the young man, who was not from Isla Vista, but quickly ran into a hurdle: the man could barely speak English.</p>\n<p>Slightly aghast that he was alone on Valentine’s Day, the officers ascertained that the severely drunk man was French. Lucky for them, a random passerby happened to speak the lovely language and started to translate for the deputies.</p>\n<p>The conservation was cut short, however, when the f’ed-up Frenchman leaned over and started to vomit profusely on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the officers arrested the lover-less lover-boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Under Intoxicated<br>\nSat. Feb. 14, 12:40 a.m. – A man carrying a full glass of amber-colored liquid stepped out onto the 6700 block of Trigo Road and into the sights of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>Having broken a cardinal rule of drinking in I.V., the inebriated individual made an easy target for the Foot Patrol, who quickly approached him and inquired into the glass’ contents.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the 22-year-old turned and started to pour the beverage onto the ground. Unfortunately for him, he was not quick enough and the officer reached out and grabbed the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputies asked the visiting Burbank resident what was in the glass, and he claimed he didn’t know. Taking him for a liar, the officers then asked if it was beer or hard alcohol, and, with his back to the corner, he said, “Probably beer.”</p>\n<p>Having solved the beverage issue, the deputies then noticed that the man’s shirt was torn from the neckline down, and that his bare, hairless chest was exposed for all to see. The deputies, relying on their deft deduction skills, asked if he had been in a fight and he nodded in agreement, but refused to say with whom.</p>\n<p>Moving on, the officers asked the out-of-towner how much he had had to drink, to which he replied, “Honestly, too much.” Taking that as their cue, they arrested the intoxicated reveler. With the cuffs on, they asked if he knew why he had been arrested and he answered, matter-of-factly, “Because I am under intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>The deputies then proceeded to escort the man to the station, during which time the -year-old looked down at his shirt, and with a puzzled look, asked how it got torn. The officers told him it was that way when they found him, but he said he didn’t believe them.</p>\n<p>The officers didn’t really mind though, because shortly after he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-02-19/police-blotter-37/","id":3848,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3847,3846,3845],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat., March 25, 1:30 a.m. - Officers on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive when they were rudely interrupted.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold<br>\nSat., March 25, 1:30 a.m. – Officers on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive when they were rudely interrupted.</p>\n<p>“Fuck the Police,” shouted an intoxicated passerby, almost as if he was looking for trouble. The deputies were happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>After stopping the 20-year-old, who was on his way to a large party at 6567 DP, the deputies asked the pugnacious partier to repeat himself.</p>\n<p>But with Isla Vista’s finest in his face, the smack talker suddenly fell silent. Reveling in the irony, the officers goaded the inebriated man, asking him if he were too drunk to realize what he had said.</p>\n<p>“No, I didn’t say anything,” he said, but the deputies were quick to refresh his memory. After some convincing, the man finally admitted to his actions, saying “I’ve had a lot to drink.”</p>\n<p>The cops, however, were not sympathetic and arrested the man for public intoxication. A quick search revealed the man was also carrying a small baggie filled with leafy marijuana, like icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Burritos After Two<br>\nFri., March 24, 2:26 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were put to work when a late-night Bill’s Bus arrived in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as one particularly inebriated man exited the bus, made his away across the adjacent park and unzipped his pants. Unaware he was being watched, the 23-year-old let it flow, dousing the building he was next to in his own pungent smell.</p>\n<p>Even though he hadn’t yet finished spelling his name in urine, the officers spoke up and kindly asked him to stop peeing on the building.</p>\n<p>The aging UCSB student had a retort ready and told the officers it was okay, “because I keep this business going by purchasing burritos from them.”</p>\n<p>Despite his stellar logic, there was one serious problem with his argument: He was peeing on the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic – a distinctly burrito-free establishment.</p>\n<p>This fact notwithstanding, the man finished his business with the wall and then nearly fell over, prompting the deputies to arrest him and transport him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Taxi Cab Blues<br>\nSat., March 25, 11:48 p.m. – Officers were called to the corner of El Colegio and Los Carnernos Roads after an inebriated man refused to pay for his taxi.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and learned that the 24-year-old owed 60 dollars to the cab driver, who had tried collecting the tab repeatedly without success. However, after talking with the young man – who was sporting a suit and pink tie – the officers determined that he did not have any money to pay the driver.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Los Angeles native appeared to have no idea where he was. When asked where he had been picked up, the ride snatcher said he had left from Isla Vista. Then, when asked where he had wanted to be dropped off, he told the deputies Isla Vista, again.</p>\n<p>As the officers processed his paperwork, the man became increasingly confused, at one point asking the officer where his car was and whether it had been towed. He seemed not to remember any car ride, however, and later refused to pay.</p>\n<p>His reason: The cab driver was not in the country legally. The validity of this statement notwithstanding, the officers arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-05-05/police-blotter-39/","id":3849,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3848,3847,3846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn't help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, d...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pledging My Time</p>\n<p>Fri., April 17, 11:11 p.m. — Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but pay attention when an intoxicated male started running back and forth down the middle of street, doing summersaults and shouting incoherently.</p>\n<p>So jubilant was the 22-year-old that he somersaulted right into an officer. The deputy, who was unharmed by the drunken gymnast, asked the young man what he was doing.</p>\n<p>Realizing he was speaking to a figure of authority, the inebriated man stood tall, his back rigid, and shouted, “Pledging my sorority, sir!”</p>\n<p>The gender-confused man didn’t have any identification on him and refused, or was simply unable, to give any personal information to the officers and instead continued to yell about his pledging efforts. Then realizing he was about to be arrested, the self-described Marine dropped to the ground, put his face to the asphalt and put his hands behind his back, shouting, “This is what I do when I get arrested, sir!”</p>\n<p>Not wishing to appear rude, the deputies arrested the hopeful pledge and started toward the patrol car. The drunken serviceman was not done being arrested, though, and dropped to the ground face-down several more times before the officers could get him in the car.</p>\n<p>Once seated, the young man lost his cool and started slamming his head against the Plexiglas divider. A few drunken hissy fits later, the deputy was forced to spray mace into his eyes.</p>\n<p> Eventually the alcohol-laden 22-year-old was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Getting Trashed</p>\n<p>Sun., April 19, 1:25 a.m. — Officers responding to reports of an unresponsive male lying on the ground behind 6571 Del Playa Drive found a heavily intoxicated man struggling to stay upright.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the 18-year-old as he was loitering about the large dumpsters behind the ocean-side apartment complex. The young UCSB student was clearly inebriated, as evidenced by the copious amounts of urine and vomit staining his jeans.</p>\n<p>The officers attempted to start a conversation with the man while they waited for paramedics to arrive, but his ability to speak had apparently been drowned in alcohol. He may, however, have just been preoccupied with something else, given that he had both hands stuffed down his heavily soiled pants. No matter the question, the self-fondling dumpster diver just stood there shivering, no doubt chilled by his moist trousers.</p>\n<p>Some time later, the paramedics arrived but eventually released the dubious drunkard back into police custody, who arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was given fresh clothing and housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Double the Drunk</p>\n<p>Sat., April 18, 1:32 a.m. — Deputies on patrol were called to 6681 Del Playa Drive to deal with a reported disturbance.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the officers witnessed a pair of twin brothers leaving an upstairs party. The two, both well beyond drunk, stumbled towards the staircase: their first obstacle.</p>\n<p>The first brother clutched the handrail tightly, eventually making it down the stairs without incident. His partner in crime, however, went full-bore down the stairs, nearly tumbling several times. It was not until he reached flat ground, however, that gravity won the battle and he fell to the pavement.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the first twin put one foot in front of the other until he reached the second main obstacle: a wooden gate. Having traveled the 30 feet to the gate, the brother could go no farther, fell to the ground and was unable to get back up.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, twin number two recovered from his tumble and made his way to the gate. His attempts to open it, however, were foiled by the fact he reached for the hinge instead of the latch.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of watching the two try to open the gate, the deputies felt obliged and opened it for them. With no other obstacles standing in their way, the 20-year-old twins were arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where they were housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-04-23/police-blotter-38/","id":3850,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3849,3848,3847],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
