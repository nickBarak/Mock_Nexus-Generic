The woman turned to her two friends and buckled her knees like a teenager swooning that the lead singer of L.A.’s indie rock band Dawes gave her such a generous display of affection.</p>\n<p>Around her, 200 people of every generation mouthed lyrics to “Time Spent in Los Angeles.” It was a grand sight to behold: grandmas, moms, dads and pre-teens gathered together, everyone knowing words to the familiar songs and eager to take in new tracks.</p>\n<p>Dawes has been around for quite a bit — officially a band on Wikipedia for 5 years in 2014 — and judging from Friday’s New Noise Music Festival performance at SOhO, they’ve amassed quite the following. Granted, their fan base is pretty close by in L.A., but it must’ve been nice to have so many admirers take the drive up the 101 to catch a hometown hero act.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The particular song SOhO sang along to was “Time Spent in Los Angeles,” a track off their second album <em>Nothing Is Wrong</em>. Its lyrics are as such: “You got that special kind of sadness/You got that tragic set of charms/That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles/Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms.” Wrap you in my arms? No wonder the lady gushed so hard.</p>\n<p>Taylor wasn’t the only Goldsmith who had the audience grinning in satisfaction. Behind him, his curly-haired brother Griffin rocked the drum set and sang harmonies to meld with Taylor’s folksong voice. Bassist Wylie Gelber later noted in an interview on the SOhO patio that “Griff might be a better singer,” to which Griffin stated, “But Taylor is THE showman, you gotta be ballsy to do what he does.”</p>\n<p>Griffin was presumably referring to Taylor’s insane guitar riffs. When Taylor ignores the microphone and focuses on the guitar, he goes into a trance. His eyes glaze ever, his teeth chew on his top lip and his body moves erotically, a motion that translates to the insane finger-plucking. He invited up a good pal who looked like a regular cowboy onstage to riff on “From a Window Seat,” from their latest album <em>Stories Don’t End</em>. The cowboy wore a toothy smile and a sense of control which contrasted Taylor’s glazed-over, out-of-this-world musicality.</p>\n<p>Also on set was keyboard extraordinaire Tay Strathairn, who got picked up by the Goldsmiths seven years ago. The other three have known each other on a daily basis for more than 10 years, and according to Gelber, they get along really well.</p>\n<p>“We do pretty good. We’re on tour so much that if we didn’t get along great it would be a nightmare. We literally have to spend every single day together. And back when we toured for seven years, it was just us in a van driving around the country.”</p>\n<p>Dawes’ car in those days was a black, 14-passenger van that they put 5,000 miles on. It was a brutal and magical time, with the constant driving through the night to get to the next show. “[We used to] drive from Des Moines to Chicago, and literally pull up to the venue, do a sound check, play and drive [off] to a new place,” said Gelber.</p>\n<p>Now Dawes has gotten beyond the days of switching off midnight drivers, and they’ve got enough clout to employ people. So it’s fun for them to play the small venues they used to with a proper crew to handle all the administrative business.</p>\n<p>“We played this exact place without a crew four years ago. Rolled up and used the guy who worked here to run our sound who never heard of our band,” said Gelber. “Now it’s so much more plush. We have a crew, we have a hotel, everything is dialed in. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Gelber, whose first name Wylie is pronounced like the cartoon coyote that chases after road runner, is a floppy-haired, laid-back guy. He explained that the purpose of the SOhO show and the mini-California tour Dawes embarked on was to practice their new songs, which will be released in a new album later this year.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are rehearsing in front of everyone … we’ve done it before in a rehearsal room and it start[ed] sounding weird and sterile,” said Gelber. “It’s much easier to figure out what works and what doesn’t when you’re playing at a show … you respond better at a show rather than when it’s the four of you.”</p>\n<p>The idea that this show was a “rehearsal” explains why each band member seemed to be in their own head onstage, figuring out particulars. While Taylor Goldsmith sang with a pick in his mouth and transported to another world on guitar, Wylie Gelber’s tall frame reclined on the speaker, as if playing the bass on a bed at home. Griffin Goldsmith kept the tempo alive on drums, but even he closed his eyes behind wire-frame glasses. Tay Strathairn kept to the keyboards and experimented with groovy Cuban beats.</p>\n<p>The four individuals blended together beautifully, and although the set included many new songs, their loyal fan base swayed in appreciation. “This really means the world to us,” Taylor Goldsmith murmured. “Favorite show of the tour by far.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zwframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A print version of this story appeared in the Daily Nexus on Thursday, Oct. 23.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/","id":7635,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7634,7633,7632],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder","biography":"Not available","articles":[3441,5909,5937,5968,6036,6940,6967,6970,6976,7003,7029,7069,7089,7090,7602,7603,7634,7635,7759],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Looking Back at American Idiot, 10 Years Later: 6 Facts about the Classic Rock Opera","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s been ten years since we first saw that white disembodied hand clutching the heart-shaped hand grenade tightly, almost as if it was for dear life.

I used to wonder whether the owner of that fist ever pulled the pin, but looking back at the impact and influence <em>American Idiot</em> has had on popular music in the past decade, I’d say he did. <em>American Idiot</em> by Green Day hit shelves on September 20, 2004, and is classified as a rock opera, or an album with a story, a concept originated by The Who.</p>\n<p>The album tells the story of a young punk who calls himself Jesus of Suburbia. Bored with small town life, he moves to the big city where he creates an alter ego: St. Jimmy, the cool, confident punk that Jesus has always wanted to be. He also meets a girl who he calls Whatsername and falls in love with her rebelliousness. The album was controversial at the time of its release, mainly for its charged political undertones and its criticism of the Bush administration and the mass media. In honor of the tenth anniversary of this classic album, here are six facts about <em>American Idiot</em> you may not have known.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>1. The famous album cover was inspired by a lyric in the album.</p>\n<p>The lesser-known track “She’s a Rebel” contains the line “she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>2. American Idiot</em> exists because of a studio theft.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Green Day was working on a record called <em>Cigarettes &amp; Valentines</em>, but when it was almost complete, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the album, the band decided that the theft was a sign that the album was not their best possible work. They started from scratch and <em>American Idiot</em> was born. Surprisingly, the songs were never leaked by the thief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Brandon Flowers of The Killers criticized Green Day for being anti-American.</p>\n<p>The Killers’ rise to fame coincided with the launch of <em>American Idiot</em>. But their singer, Brandon Flowers didn’t appreciate Green Day playing their songs overseas. He said the concert film <em>Bullet in a Bible</em>, filmed in the UK, offended him because Green Day was making America look bad in the eyes of kids in other nations. “Where do they film their DVD? In England. A bunch of kids screaming ‘I don’t want to be an American idiot,’” Flowers said. However, in 2013, Flowers apologized to the band for his comments during a The Killers concert at Wembley Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The album was adapted into a Broadway play in 2009.</p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> became a musical that used every song from the record as well as some songs from follow-up album <em>21st Century Breakdown</em>. The musical premiered in Berkeley in 2009 before debuting on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. The release of <em>American Idiot</em> marked the second time Green Day had been criticized for selling out.</p>\n<p>When Green Day first rose to fame with their third studio album, <em>Dookie, </em>in 1994, their friends and fans in the Berkeley underground punk scene ostracized them for signing to a major label. Ironically, many of the people that embraced them and the newly popular punk culture similarly lambasted the baned ten years later for their reinvented sound on <em>American Idiot</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. “Wake Me Up When September Ends” is not about 9/11, but the death of singer Billie Joe Armstrong’s father.</p>\n<p>In September of 1982, when Armstrong was 10 years old, his father passed away. After the funeral he ran to his room crying and locked himself inside. When his mother came to comfort him he said from behind the door, “Wake me up when September ends.” Of course, having been released in 2005 when the September 11, 2001 tragedy was fresh in people’s memories, Americans found the song even more potent and powerful, creating the common misconception.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/Ee_uujKuJMIframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Ee_uujKuJMI\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57509\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57509\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/looking-back-at-american-idiot-10-years-later-6-facts-about-the-classic-rock-opera/","id":7632,"author":{"id":758,"name":"Arasch Blurfrushan"},"related":[7631,7630,7629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tour Bus Interview With G-Eazy Before Sold-Out Hub Performance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As I walked up the narrow steps of the white tour bus that was stationed behind the Hub, my eyes glazed at the lavishness of the interior of the vehicle.

In front of me was a lengthy figure sitting on crocodile-leather seats, wearing tight black skinny jeans, a plain black tee and a slick leather jacket. He stood up and extended his arm out to me to introduce himself. “Gerald,” he said, a sincere grin on his face. He offered me a drink and we sat down, turned to each other. Although I tried to play it off and act cool, I couldn’t help but tremble with nervousness at the surreal thought that I was about to interview G-Eazy for his sold-out show at the Hub.</p>\n<p>25-year-old Gerald Gillum, otherwise known as G-Eazy, is a popular rapper, songwriter and producer from Oakland, CA. His 2014 debut studio album entitled <em>These Things Happen</em> peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, as created by a skyrocketing demand for the young artist’s addictive hip hop beats and lyrical control. Having just launched his nationwide “From the Bay to the Universe” tour, the Oakland rapper hit Santa Barbara on only the fourth day — Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>G-Eazy discovered his passion for rapping at the age of 14. He explained the strong sense of determination he felt when he realized that rapping is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. “I just figured that if I’m going to do this, I want to do it and take it as far as I can go. I want to be a legend.” From what we can see today, this motivation has brought him to a successful music career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He continued to pursue his dedication to music throughout college. Having graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in music industry studies in 2011, G-Eazy is well-experienced with balancing both music and school. “Moving to New Orleans brought in my horizons,” he said. “I met my manager there, as well as other driven, like-minded people. I feel like college really helped give me that extra push I needed to get me to where I needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Gaining inspiration from notable artists such as the Beatles, Drake, Kanye West, Tupac and E40, G-Eazy combines hip hop and R&amp;B melodies with oldies and rock ’n’ roll. “I draw little pieces from music and use those influences to create my own songs,” he explained, sipping on a cup of hot coffee. “I’ll really like how this kick-drum sounds in this song, or the way this particular synth sounds, or this kind of a cord-progression, or this kind of a melody. I just take little pieces from a bunch of different places and pull it all together.”</p>\n<p>Despite G-Eazy’s catchy tunes and hooking rhythms, there’s a lot more to artist’s songs than their musical components, and that’s where his lyrical abilities come in. An admirable lyricist, G-Eazy aims to showcase his helter-skelter-type life. “My songs are about lifestyle,” he said with a kind nod. “They’re about my reaction, my perspective and my outlook on the world.”</p>\n<p>G-Eazy’s lifestyle is definitely not a normal one. From traveling around the country to promoting his latest album, a break is the last thing on the rapper’s mind. When describing his current tour, he was excited to tell me how well it was going — even on its fourth day in. “This is the best tour yet, by far. It’s just an honor to be able to tour with somebody like E40 — he’s a legend and I grew up listening to him, so it’s a privilege to share a bill like that.”</p>\n<p>Feeling rather like a mere outsider looking in, I had to ask how it felt to have reached number three on the Billboard 200 chart. “It’s all validation,” he said. “When I work in the studio, it’s this lonely process of creating something. All you can do is just hope it works. You just hope that what you’re making is going to resonate with people and you hope that they’re going to respond and like it. And when stuff like sold-out shows or being on the charts happens … that’s the return. It’s like ‘oh shit, this worked.’” He seemed proud of what he was saying — confident in his journey as an artist and what he is capable of accomplishing.</p>\n<p>As the interview was coming to an end, I asked if he had any advice for UCSB students wishing to step into the music industry. While at first he comically replied “don’t do drugs,” he continued on a more serious note. “Start whatever it is you want to be before you graduate — don’t wait until after college. It takes a lot of years on the runway to get the plane off the ground,” said G-Eazy. “College is kind of like this safe bubble — you think it sucks, but the real world really sucks. I would take all my free time in college working on music so that by the time I finished, hopefully that plane would be off the ground and I could be doing music full time.” From what I can tell, his strategy worked.</p>\n<p>Before I knew it, my time with the rapper came to a close as he was called to do a sound check. The line outside the Hub nearly extended to Storke Tower, with many UCSB students ready to have one of the best nights of their lives. G-Eazy performed songs such as “Downtown Love,” “Lady Killers,” “Let’s Get Lost” and of course, “I Mean It.”</p>\n<p>While the crowd didn’t have that one-on-one experience I was lucky enough to have, G-Eazy was just as inviting and enrapturing onstage in the Hub as he was in the interview. Soon enough I realized that the Oakland native’s charisma and ability to connect with people is exactly why the world just can’t get enough of him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57513\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"536306097\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57513\" data-attachment-id=\"57513\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/geazy5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"780,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57513\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=556%2C370\" alt=\"Courtesy of hopelessthunder.org\" width=\"556\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>hopelessthunder.org</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/images1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1496610293\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><br>\n</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57508\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57508\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/","id":7633,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7632,7631,7630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cherub Headlines New Noise: Drugs, Sex and Indie Pop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Doses and Mimosas” first infiltrated the speakers of Isla Vista in 2012.

It was easily one of the biggest anthems of the year, along with the overplayed “Feel So Close” and horridly catchy “Call Me Maybe.” For some reason “Doses and Mimosas” never got old for me (can’t say the same about you, Carly Rae Jepsen), and it was super groovy to see the act behind the song live. Last Sunday, Oct. 19, Cherub sparkled as the headliner of the Block Party, the last hurrah of this year’s New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, I caught up with Josh Ocean of Ghost Beach, who preceded Cherub. Ocean was a generous conversationalist, complimenting the band onstage and pondering musical ideas out loud. He told me he liked my floral headband (made of fabric scraps from a booth at the front of the Block Party), so I gave it to him. He immediately put the purple mangled mess over his bleached blonde hair and gave me an appreciative high five.</p>\n<p>Ocean is the vocals and synth master of Ghost Beach, a Brooklyn-based electro-pop duo. They’ve been on tour with Cherub for the last eight weeks after the two groups met in London. “It’s been so crazy [being with them],” said Ocean. I pressed him for details, to which he took off his robin egg blue shades, widened his eyes and said, “Use your imagination.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kelly classic “Bump ‘n Grind,” the two men who form electronic pop band Cherub danced their way to the stage, only to become wary of the crappy sound system and shortened time slot. This was around 6:48, and Cherub was the last of six bands to close out the weekend. Unfortunately for the disco pop duo, the venue’s monitors were faulty, and they ran into timing issues for the rest of the show. Thankfully, spirits were running high through the crowd, and Cherub made the best of the unlucky circumstances.</p>\n<p>The duo, which consists of bassist Jordan Kelley and guitarist Jason Huber, were super attentive to the audience, singling out people in the crowd and giving a shout out to an old friend named Matt who they tried all the drugs with back in the day. If there was one thing that Cherub made clear on Sunday, it was that they love their drugs and sex. Of course, anyone who has mildly creeped on their social media would be able to tell you that. According to Facebook, they’ve got a “common goal to share a little bit of sex, a little bit of drugs and a whole lot of love with people across the globe.”</p>\n<p>“I wanna see more clouds,” said Kelley, referencing the marijuana and cigarette fog that floated above the 400 person crowd. Kelley began several anecdotes onstage, only to continue singing under the pressure of time. So he truncated the storytelling with little snippets like, “This song is about casual sex,” and “This song is about doing a lot of cocaine in the bathroom stall.” It was obvious that Kelley wanted to charm the audience more with his potent soliloquies; under the circumstances, he did what he could.</p>\n<p>In an act that demonstrates Cherub’s all-night-long attitude, Kelley cordially invited everyone to an after-party at EOS Lounge, yelling that even though the noise ordinance at the Block Party was at 8 o’clock, “We are going to play music until we all black out.” Drunken college kids cheered, waved their arms back and forth and made out with the stranger next to them.</p>\n<p>Cherub sang new tracks from their latest release <em>Year of the Caprese</em>, including “&lt;3 (Heart),” “Do the Math” and “Disco Shit.” They fed the audience the old stuff — “XOXO” from <em>MoM and DaD</em> and of course the classic champagne showers song that got them so popular in the first place, “Doses and Mimosas.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the show, Kelley and Huber were looking pretty knackered, both sweating profusely with their hair hanging in strings. But their eyes were still ablaze, especially when they did a duo guitar solo together. “Hey,” said Kelley. “You guys are the best — what day is it? — best Sunday crowd we’ve ever had!”</p>\n<p>When the best Sunday crowd Cherub ever had screamed for an encore, Kelley and Huber came back onstage, only to have their mics cut off. If this was any other band, they would have gone back to the hotel, complained about the shortened time slot and knocked out in preparation for more shows in L.A.
