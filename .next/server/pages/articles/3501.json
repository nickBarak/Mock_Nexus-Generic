In 2011 she was awarded second team All-Big West honors and was an honorable mention All-Big West player as a freshman. At Woodside High in Redwood City, she was named team MVP four years in a row, and has played for the Stanford Water Polo Club, the U.S. Junior National Team and was a member of the Pacific Zone team that won the 2006 Zone Championships.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Yet despite a lifetime’s worth of achievements in the sport, Milne has not always been a water polo player. In fact, it was never her idea to play.</p>\n<p>“My dad actually forced me to play water polo,” Milne said. “He told me he would pay me to go to practice.”</p>\n<p>Before Milne turned to water polo, she was a basketball player and had also played soccer. At 5’11”, she has the height to play a post position in basketball and as a goalkeeper, which was her position when she played soccer. When she got to high school, she had to choose whether she wanted to keep playing basketball or give water polo a try. In the end, she chose the pool over the court, the net over the hoop.</p>\n<p>“I hated [water polo] for about the first two weeks,” Milne said. “After that I started to really get into it.”</p>\n<p>Though Milne was a great player in high school, her team failed to meet the standard she set. According to her, the only reason colleges took notice of and recruited her was because she played club water polo and for the national team. And once she did start the process of deciding where to play in college, UCSB was not at the top of her list.</p>\n<p>“I was originally getting recruited to Stanford and bigger schools, and I always assumed that I would be going to a bigger school like UCLA or Stanford, but some of them backed away because of my grades,” Milne said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Milne, the high school goalie class that she graduated with was extremely talented, which limited the schools that would recruit her. It was her desire to play and improve that drew her to UCSB. The Gaucho coaching staff promised her a chance to play right away and she jumped at it.</p>\n<p>“The goalies that did go to bigger schools ended up on the bench their first year, and I don’t think I could have stayed on the team if that happened,” Milne said. “This was also the friendliest and most inviting team I visited on my recruiting tour. If I had the chance, I would make the same choice again.”</p>\n<p>It was her work ethic and desire to play that also drew UCSB’s coaches to Milne.</p>\n<p>“When she came in, I knew she wanted to go to a school where she would play right away because that was the only way she would progress,” Head Coach Cathy Neushul said. “I watched her play on the junior national team, and she was absolutely the one we wanted. I did have a choice, but the feedback I got from her coaches drew us to her.”</p>\n<p>Playing every day for UCSB has turned Milne into the player and athlete she is today and has led her to all her accomplishments in the sport, including setting UCSB’s new all-time save record.</p>\n<p>“I was kind of frustrated because I really wanted to break it my sophomore year, but we had to forfeit like five games,” Milne said. “It was really exciting when it did happen. I actually didn’t know anything about [the record] until near the end of my sophomore year.”</p>\n<p>Playing every day has also turned her into the leader that she is today. As a goalie, she is the team’s anchor, and every day she works to fill that role as best she can and do what she can for the team.</p>\n<p>“The main thing about Ruth is she definitely has a work ethic that is unparalleled,” Neushul said. “If she makes a mistake, she can immediately get herself and her team refocused. If I had to have one person lead me into battle, it would be her.”</p>\n<p>Yet even now, three years and 904 saves later, Milne’s life is still not all about water polo. Fierce competitor though she is in the pool, outside of water polo, she is a very easygoing person.</p>\n<p>“I love watching movies because I’m a film major,” Milne said. “Water polo kind of takes over my life, but I really like just hanging out with my friends and teammates.”</p>\n<p>At first, balancing school, water polo and a social life proved difficult, but Milne eventually settled in.</p>\n<p>“It was really hard my freshman year,” Milne said. “I struggled a lot making the change. All the girls are really helpful and encouraging. It’s just something you get used to. It’s like having a job; it’s preparing me for life after college.”</p>\n<p>Though she still has one more year left at UCSB, during which she is guaranteed to surpass 1,000 career saves, Milne is already beginning to plan for a future when she’ll no longer defend the net for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been talking to some friends who played abroad and to my parents, and I’m thinking about playing professionally in Europe,” Milne said. “Playing professional water polo isn’t too difficult because it’s kind of a small sport, though it is bigger in Europe than America. Or, maybe I’ll go to grad school.”</p>\n<p>But before she leaves, Milne still has unfinished business at UCSB. She wants to reach that 1,000 save mark, which will surely prove well worth the few dollars her father spent as a friendly bribe all those years ago.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to be able to win the Big West,” Milne said. “In the past it’s been kind of a far goal, but next year a lot of teams are losing a lot of players to graduation and we’re only losing two. I’d also like to make first team All-American.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/athlete-arenas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/athlete-arenas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/athlete-arenas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/athlete-arenas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/athlete-arenas/","id":3501,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3500,3499,3498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Who’s Who on Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As UCSB students, it’s easy to identify what makes our peers flock to the university; the student body is politically savvy and environmentally conscious, its scholars are awarded top honors on a regular basis and off-campus housing is located in an area that can be fittingly described as a beach paradise.</p>\n<p>What’s often overlooked by the student body are the requirements to ensure smooth day-to-day operations at the university.

Yang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A former dean of engineering and distinguished professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, Chancellor Henry T. Yang is — quite literally — a rocket scientist.</p>\n<p>Since joining UCSB in 1994 as both chancellor and a professor of mechanical engineering, Yang has seen the university weather a heavy storm. While economic recession has made marks worldwide, its effects have been particularly brutal on state education.</p>\n<p>Despite substantial efforts to combat the devastating budget cuts, Yang said the end of the UC’s fiscal maelstrom is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>“Our challenge this year is to sustain the remarkable momentum of our progress while continuing to absorb the state budget cuts,” Yang said in an e-mail. “Despite these budget challenges, we remain absolutely unwavering in our commitment to providing our students with the quality education they deserve. After all, our students are the reason we are here.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of his most challenging tasks is communicating effectively with groups such as the UC Office of the President, alumni, donors, community members and representatives in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., to make sure that his decisions are well-informed and well-received.</p>\n<p>“It is important for all voices to be heard so that each person becomes a true partner in the process,” Yang said. “I think that’s what makes UC Santa Barbara so special — we are not just a university, we are also a community.”</p>\n<p>Yang is also well-known for demonstrating his commitment to the heart of the university: its student body. While some high-level administrators struggle to schedule time to spend with their student body, Yang said he thrives on it.</p>\n<p>“My wife, Dilling, and I are privileged to live on campus, near our residence halls and dining commons,” he said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of our daily campus life is getting to know our students — sharing dinner at the dining commons, cheering at student performances and athletic events, talking with students during our regular walks around campus and Isla Vista and working with our students on campus issues.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26804\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"903102166\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26804\" data-attachment-id=\"26804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/gene-lucas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"gene lucas\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Glenn (Gene) Lucas&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"gene lucas\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn (Gene) Lucas</p></div></span><strong>Glenn (“Gene”) Lucas</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Executive Vice Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus himself, Gene Lucas went on to earn a Sc.D. degree at MIT before returning to UCSB in 1978 to teach at the College of Engineering.

It will be a campus that relies more heavily upon bicycle and pedestrian circulation and will continue to push into new areas of sustainability.”</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing him to utilize his passion for architecture, Fisher said his role at the university has given him the opportunity to join a tight-knit community.</p>\n<p>“My job entails so much variety — it is truly never dull,” he said. “I get to work with great people and have direct access to a cross section of our campus community — students, faculty and staff — as well as our local community.  Along with all of that, we are building and serving a campus environment commensurate with the academic excellence of this university.”</p>\n<p><span></span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1634231109\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/young/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"young\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Michael Young&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"young\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><strong>Michael Young</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</strong></p>\n<p>As UCSB students, we know that a university is defined by more than what goes on inside its classrooms. It would be safe to say that Michael Young is responsible for almost everything else.</p>\n<p>As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Young oversees more than 20 departments, including admissions, counseling, Student Health and the MultiCultural Center. After 20 years on the job, Young said his favorite part has always been — and will continue to be — his connection with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I know this will sound corny, but I really love working with UCSB students,” Young said. “I feel that I lucked out and ended up in a great career, in a great place for students. I’ve also had some extraordinary colleagues here in Santa Barbara and it’s been an absolute joy working with these professionals, trying to do our best to serve students here.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student body is a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>“At times in my job, I have a responsibility for either life-or-death matters relative to students or I have to become involved in situations where the academic careers of certain students are at risk,” Young said. “I’ve found that, even after all these years — and I’m glad of this — it has not come easy. It’s pretty sobering. Every time I am engaged in one of those situations, I am reminded that each and every student is an individual with a life and with a family, with dreams and hopes.”</p>\n<p>Although the Division of Student Affairs has been suffering at least $1 million of cutbacks a year for the past seven consecutive years, Young said he is determined to shield students from the repercussions.</p>\n<p>“[My goal] is to find out the impacts and the implications of the budget situation and then respond to that so that we can find ways to live within our new financial realities and continue to provide high-quality services to students,” Young said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/","id":3498,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3497,3496,3495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yes Men to Visit UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":" Writer and Managing Editor Lexi Pandell interviews political satire group \"Yes Men\" on their recent activities and future plans.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Daily Nexus: First of all, thank you for taking the time to speak with me.</p>\n<p>No problem.

Pictured above, they travel the world in an effort to expose harsh truths to the unsuspecting public, often putting themselves in the midst of political turmoil, and impersonate officials like Jude Finisterra, a Dow Chemical Spokesperson, live on BBC News.</p></div></span>DN: You and Andy Bichlbaum have successfully impersonated officials from a number of high-profile companies, ranging from McDonald’s to Dow Chemical Company. How exactly do you pick your targets?</p>\n<p>How do we pick our targets? Good question. Well, it differs. Sometimes it’s just a matter of it being the biggest and the baddest. So, it’s really obvious. We did target ExxonMobil — and they’re both the biggest and the baddest, so it was easy. They have the largest profits for about five years running of any corporation. So, you know, in many ways, in that way, they were behind a lot of the sort of anti-climate activist campaigns and, basically, they were funding a lot of the climate change denial. They’ve stopped a lot of that now after it came out, but there were obvious reasons for targeting them.</p>\n<p>Increasingly over the years, we’ve worked with organizations who have been working on an issue for a long time and they say, “Hey, can you help us by targeting, for example, Dow Chemical because they haven’t cleaned up the mess in Bhopal and we don’t want it to become a precedent that, since they bought Union Carbide and then tried to wash their hands of it.”</p>\n<p>DN: Do you consider what you do to be “high-profile pranks” or is there another term that you prefer?</p>\n<p>We usually call them “actions.” They’re always intended to have political impact. We say “actions” because they’re events or spectacles. … The problem with “pranks” is that it often makes one think that they’re basically meant to be silly. … The other thing about pranks is that they’re often targeted at friends. When somebody describes a prank, they’re often thinking about Ashton Kutcher’s “Punk’d” or friends playing tricks on each other or the practical joke. So, we do, when we can, stay away from the word for that reason. We do think of what we do as having serious intent regardless of how funny or strange it is.</p>\n<p>DN: In your opinion, what are some of the most notable actions that the Yes Men have taken to date?</p>\n<p>Let’s see, probably one of the best publicized was when we printed an entire fake edition of the New York Times and we distributed 100,000 copies on the streets of New York along with volunteers from our mailing list. It was a New York Times that was full of good news, basically a lot of hopeful news. It came out about a week after Obama was elected and the message of it all was to keep pushing people to keep pushing after the election, not to just stop. Which, unfortunately, is in some ways what’s come to pass.</p>\n<p>So, that was pretty notable. But, last year, we impersonated the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is the largest lobbying organization in the world, and we announced that they were changing their position on climate change. And that resulted in not only a huge amount of media attention, but a lawsuit. We’re currently facing that suit and we think that that was widely successful. Not only because we’re being sued, but because them suing us indicates that maybe we’re attacking them where it counts.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.yesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1923122465\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26701\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/5_bbc_dow_announcement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=1132%2C755&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1132,755\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5_BBC_DOW_Announcement-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" title=\"5_BBC_DOW_Announcement\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26701\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Can you tell me more about the lawsuit that the Chamber of Commerce has pressed and if there are any updates on that situation?</p>\n<p>They are still suing us. There’s not really much going on with it. Right now, there’s been a motion to dismiss by our lawyers…and the judge is reviewing it, and has been for many months. We don’t know exactly when we’ll hear the next thing, but that’s where we’re at right now. Of course, if the judge doesn’t dismiss it and the Chamber continues to press it, then eventually we could end up in court.</p>\n<p>I think that, overall though, the Chamber’s claims are totally ludicrous. I think if we end up in court, they’ll have a lot more to answer for then we do. Because they spend almost half a million dollars every day lobbying, not to mention what they do during elections. Now that there’s no limits on what third parties can spend, the Chambers running tons of advertising for candidates who are super duper business friendly and are basically all Republican candidates.</p>\n<p>DN: So, essentially, are they accusing the Yes Men as a whole of committing fraudulent activities?</p>\n<p>…If you look at the lawsuit, which you can on the [Electronic Frontier Foundation] Web site [www.eff.org], what they’re actually claiming is that we were doing things, basically, as a form of advertising and that we’re trying to make money off of their trademark. I think it’s a really funny assumption that we were in a press conference where we impersonated them, we made direct political statements and then, afterward, our follow-up press releases were all about the content and the issues. It’s hard to understand how they think that we can make a business out of that or make money out of that somehow. It’s a misunderstanding that makes sense for people who only think of business. All they think is that the only reason for existence is making money.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of www.theyesmenfixtheworld.com” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1331337717\" data-slb-group=\"26698\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/men-visit-ucsb/1_dead_man_float/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"1_Dead_Man_Float\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26700\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1_Dead_Man_Float.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>DN: Now that you’ve achieved a certain level of fame both from the films and the Chamber lawsuit, do you think you and Andy will start to encounter any issues trying to pose as top officials or spokesmen?</p>\n<p>We don’t really know. We haven’t experienced any massive problems yet. There have been a few events where people have recognized us, usually they’re just a few people in the audience, and they don’t say anything to the conference organizers right then and there because they want to see what’s going to happen.</p>\n<p>DN: On your Web site there’s a page called the “Fix the World Challenge.” Can you tell me more about that and how the Yes Men are encouraging individuals to become more politically involved?</p>\n<p>Well, the “Fix the World Challenge” was an attempt to create a sort of social network game where people would contribute and discuss their own political pranks and their own creative activist actions…Right now, we’re focusing more on what we call the “Yes Lab,” which is a way for us to help organizations do more projects themselves. There’s a series of workshops that we offer for organizations that have an idea for a project and those that simply want to brainstorm a project and learn all of our tricks. So, that’s kind of where we are right now, but the idea is to kind of spread the joy and make it possible for all kinds of groups to leverage some of the techniques we’ve developed over the years for their own purposes.</p>\n<p>DN: In conclusion, tell me about what you have planned for the Oct. 15 event at UCSB?</p>\n<p>Yeah, well, I mean our plans are to come and talk to people about what we do, what we’ve been doing. We’ll show a show and tell. We’ll show some of the things we have and maybe we’ll lead the audience in a little brain storming session. That’s it, we don’t have any special tricks up our sleeve for Santa Barbara, but we may if it seems like it’s what the audience wants. We will be showing video clips that nobody’s seen before, at least no human[s] other than the Yes Men.</p>\n<p>We’ll be there to answer questions or, if you prefer, we can give you rotten fruit and vegetables to throw at us. But that has to be arranged in advance.

I know you’ve been confused without me. You’ve been biting your fingernails wondering just what to do with your fantasy team. Well fret no more, for I am here to help, and just in time too. In case you weren’t paying attention, there is a new collective bargaining agreement, and football is back. Yet it is a different league than it was, as the aftermath of the new collective bargaining agreements saw players who had been cornerstones of their teams for years cut and traded.<br>\nOne such player is Chad Ochocinco, the wide receiver formerly known as Chad Johnson, who is now with the New England Patriots after spending the previous 10 years with the Bengals. Now I know some of you saw that and decided to draft him for your fantasy team, believing that he’d come in and immediately take over the role that Randy Moss once played. I understand why you would think that, but it’s completely stupid.<br>\nOcho, while speedy, was never a deep threat on the level of Moss, and the Patriots run arguably the most complex offense in the league. Expecting him to come in and pick it up immediately after a shortened offseason and after spending the previous 10 years working in a much simpler offense is expecting a miracle. There was absolutely no way it was going to happen.<br>\nHowever, I do believe it will be sooner rather than later that Ochocinco will start to step up. Yes, he hasn’t done much through the first three weeks of the season and yes, he did drop an easy pass from Tom Brady that would have gone for a touchdown against the Bills, but he has a lot of things going for him right now. First of all, he no longer has the stupidest, most self-indulgent name in sports. That dubious honor now belongs to Ron Artest, otherwise known as Metta World Peace.<br>\nSecondly, the Patriots’ offense, while complex, requires hard work and promotes constant improvement in those willing to put in the work. Talented players like Ochocinco can thrive in that offense if they work hard — and Ocho does want to work, if only to prove that he’s still one of the best. He is learning the offense, slowly but surely. The mere fact that he was targeted on that long pass against Buffalo is evidence of that, as in the previous two games he had only been targeted on short passes. He will, eventually, be the deep threat for New England.<br>\nFinally, the Patriots have a lot of weapons. While that does mean that Ochocinco will see fewer targets than he would on a team where he was the featured weapon, it also means that defenses can’t focus on him alone. They also have to watch out for Deion Branch, Wes Welker, Aaron Hernandez, Rob Gronkowski and the myriad of other receivers that the Patriots roll out each week, all of whom are capable and dangerous. As an added bonus, the Patriots have a respectable ground game. The Law Firm named BenJarvus Green-Ellis was a 1000 yard rusher a year ago and Danny Woodhead is quick and a good receiver out of the backfield. Additionally, rookie Stevan Ridley looked good against the Bills.<br>\nI don’t mean to overly praise the Patriots. My point is simply that most teams can’t afford to double team Ochocinco because of all the weapons Tom Brady has at his disposal. Once Ocho learns the offense, and he will, he will be able to break that single coverage for long scores. He still has that ability, so don’t be discouraged by his early season struggles. New England will be good for him in the end, and he will produce. If you drafted him thinking he’d immediately be a major contributor…well, you shouldn’t have. But don’t give up on him just yet. If I’m right, and I usually am, those who are patient will be rewarded.<br>\nPick Up of the Week: Matt Hasselbeck, QB, Tennessee Titans. Thus far Hasselbeck seems rejuvenated. He’s thrown for over 300 yards in two of his first three games with the Titans to go along with seven touchdowns. He’s developed a good rapport with receiver Kenny Britt, and with the exception of this week the two have been torching defenses, including the stout Baltimore Ravens. With running back Chris Johnson still struggling to get going, Hasselbeck is going to be asked to shoulder more of the load, and so far that doesn’t seem like a bad thing. If you are in need of a starting quarterback or a capable backup, Hasselbeck is available in 81.5 percent of ESPN leagues.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/green-advice-green-people-ochhocinco-kiss-da-baby/","id":3500,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3499,3498,3497],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
