Most recycled water is non-potable, or unsafe for drinking. Non-potable water is used primarily for irrigation of plants not intended for consumption.</p>\n<p>The project will install “purple pipes,” a type of pipe that carries recycled water in an environmentally-conscious way. The project will stretch from Embarcadero Del Norte south to People’s Park, Perfect Park, Little Acorn Park and the nearby areas.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, the newly appointed IVRPD director, made the motion to authorize staff to work on the project at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major, told the <em>Nexus</em> last Thursday that one of his goals as a director would be to install the infrastructure needed to provide recycled water.</p>\n<p>The recycled water project is a step toward fulfilling the promises IVRPD board members made when campaigning for “yes” on Measure O.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">According to its budget</a>, the IVRPD estimates it will receive $256,358 in tax revenue because the measure passed in May.</p>\n<p>The parks district said earlier this year it would use the funds to address a “backlog of deferred maintenance” in its parks as well as bring reclaimed water to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Every single one of us has knocked on the door and said this is a thing we’ve wanted to do,” IVRPD Director Carlos López said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/board-agenda/agenda/2017/BrdAgenda%20October%2012%202017.pdf\">According to IVRPD’s Oct. 12 agenda</a>, the parks district asked the Goleta Water District if it would be interested in entering an agreement to provide stable water rates if the district chose to install purple pipes in the park.</p>\n<p>The water district said in an attachment to last week’s meeting agenda that the rates are determined by studies and that any agreement must comply with the current water rate, though reclaimed water cannot be charged at a higher rate than the cost for providing it.</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said investing in this type of water comes with risks because the rates could change at any moment or the water district could choose to stop offering recycled water.</p>\n<p>He reassured board members that the idea was likely “safe enough, but that there is no guarantee the rates will not change or that water will continue to be offered. Board members agreed and authorized the decision through a unanimous vote.</p>\n<p>At their meeting, the IVRPD also moved forward with a number of park improvement projects, including a new irrigation project for Sueno Park’s orchards and installing power to People’s Park to host bands and festivals.</p>\n<p>According to the board’s agenda, the project to bring irrigation to Sueno Park will cost approximately $5,700<strong>. </strong>Diane Dodds, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, donated $2,000 to the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>The board also approved the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) to use their parks to host the newly-expanded Community Service Escort program. The service district’s board of directors voted to expand the program to increase safety in I.V. in September.</p>\n<p>The CSD will work with CSOs by setting up tents near highly-frequented areas on weekends so community service officers may provide escorts to anybody who requests service.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD board of directors meets every second Thursday of the month from 6 to 8 p.m. in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Cooperative.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously said the IVRPD would install potable water.

Tate also has two wins in his two appearances.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s core four starters have allowed 16 of the total 33 runs scored against the Waves in seven games, however, junior right-handed pitcher Jackson McClelland has accounted for none of those runs in his 13 innings pitched. McClelland has also recorded eight walks and 11 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>At bat for the Gauchos, junior infielder Dalton Kelly comes off an up-and-down series against Kentucky, as he went 3-5 with five RBIs on Saturday and 0-5 on Sunday. However, Kelly has the most at-bats on the lineup, and has gone 11-30 and scored eight runs this season.</p>\n<p>In addition, senior outfielder Cameron Newell is heating up, as he maintains a .760 batting average through two series with thirteen runs scored for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“If you try to go up there and drive in runs, you’re not going to. If you try too hard, you’re going to have bad at-bats,” Checketts said. “We’ve hit well with two outs, and runners in scoring position, but [Sunday] is the first time we didn’t have those big hits.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face the Waves at 2 p.m. in Malibu today, before they return home to face the University of Oregon in a three-game series this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/baseball-travels-to-pepperdine-for-one-game-series/","id":4391,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4390,4389,4388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Punches Attacker, Escapes After Sexual Assault","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVFP-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The victim turned and punched the suspect in the face, knocking him onto the ground, according to SBSO.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara student was sexually assaulted when she was walking home Saturday night but escaped after punching her attacker in the face, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 22-year-old woman was walking home on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive at approximately 8:50 p.m. She was nearing El Embarcadero Road when a man behind her allegedly grabbed her crotch through her clothing, according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim turned and punched the suspect in the face, knocking him onto the ground, according to SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheriff’s deputies and UC Police Department officers from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) searched the area for the suspect but were unable to find him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement said the suspect is described as a 6-foot-tall Caucasian male with black hair wearing a black-colored shirt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBSO is investigating the case.

goals. He said he chose to apply because he believes in I.V. self-governance and hopes to bring his experience in advocacy, lobbying, fundraising and “navigating bureaucracies” to the district.</p>\n<p>“I want to be general manager to make sure that the CSD is successful in its first year in establishing itself, establishing its role in the community, making relationships built in the community and having a good reputation as a voice for change and good change in I.V. and I feel like I am well-suited to do that,” he said in a phone interview with the <em>Nexus </em>Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Abboud, a 2014 UC Santa Barbara alumnus, also plans to strengthen the district’s finances and find an independent revenue stream.</p>\n<p>He was a primary organizer for Isla Vista self-governance and directed the Yes on E &amp; F campaign for board elections in the CSD.</p>\n<p>The CSD will pay Abboud $4,000 from its professional development fund and may pay more based on his success in acquiring grants, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>Board member Spencer Brandt said the CSD plans to hire a full-time general manager when the district receives additional funding.</p>\n<p>In February 2016, the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative estimated the general manager salary would be $162,500. In March, before a tax to fund the CSD failed, First District Supervisor Das Williams estimated the salary for a General Manager position would cost $100,000 annually.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. CSD has acquired a general manager at 6 percent of cost estimated in the 2015 Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study,” Brandt said. “We are proving that we can do a lot with a little.”</p>\n<p>At a press conference Wednesday afternoon at People’s Park, Bertrand said the general manager’s role will be to execute the board’s policies, but ultimately it is the board’s duty to create policies, develop procedures and oversee finances.</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that the CSD is drafting a contract for the general manager’s role. The CSD’s lawyer, G. Ross Trindle, said the contract will become public when the details have been negotiated and finalized.</p>\n<p>The CSD hired Abboud through his consulting company which he created Sept. 17, two weeks after the application deadline for the position, according to California state records. He is the only employee of the firm and said he created the company so he could accept the position as general manager.</p>\n<p>According to Trindle, the district’s revenue stream would be unable to support salaries and benefits for a public employee. And, because it can’t sustain a payroll system, the CSD hired its general manager through a firm.</p>\n<p>“Having an Interim General Manager on a contract basis via a consultant allows the District to receive the general manager services it needs to function more efficiently to deliver much-needed services to District residents,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>In a Tuesday press release, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand praised Abboud’s service to I.V. and called it “an honor” to have him as general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that there were only two applicants to the position, Abboud Consulting, LLC and Lechowicz &amp; Tseng Municipal Consultants, LLC – an Oakland consulting firm formed in March, according to state records.</p>\n<p>Lechowicz &amp; Tseng requested “significantly more” pay than what Abboud requested, Bertrand said, though that fact did not impact the decision since, ultimately, the group removed themselves from the applicant pool.</p>\n<p>The government consulting firm removed itself from the pool after the beginning of the application review process. Bertrand said the group was more focused on finances and strategic planning than the “general management” of the district.</p>\n<p>Abboud said his firm has no clients but has previously worked in acquiring grants and helped the CSD apply for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation.</p>\n<p>Abboud is currently on the board of directors for the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, an I.V. nonprofit that coordinates funding for the CSD.</p>\n<p>When asked whether this influenced the decision to hire Abboud, Bertrand said he is not legally allowed to speak on the deliberations for a general manager.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also said the CSD plans to release over 100 pages of documents from the application and review process.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the main focus he has for the CSD is to envision its future and lay down a plan for what is to come.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s conference, he said his plan was never to stay in I.V. after completing his undergraduate degree, but instead to “do something more traditional.” However, the creation of the CSD drove him to remain in I.V. in order to make it a better place.</p>\n<p>“That’s been the most proud work of my life that I’ve worked on, and it’s such a joy to now be able to have worked on creating this district and now to be able to work on executing the district’s vision,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Oct. 12, 12:30 a.m.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79052\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79052\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-11/community-services-district-hires-jonathan-abboud-as-interim-general-manager/","id":4393,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4392,4391,4390],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
