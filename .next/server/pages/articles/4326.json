What they see could determine the amount of law enforcement they deploy, according to Camarena.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) held a town hall to discuss police presence, parking restrictions, fencing, public concerns and the ideal Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Camarena and Millard also guaranteed that undocumented students will be safe from detainment due to immigration status, and they explained instances in which students will have to present identification to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“We come into contact with people that violate the law, we don’t care about their legal status,” Camarena said. “As long as they provide some type of ID that’s not fake.”</p>\n<p>To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Students at the town hall also expressed concerns regarding the amount of fencing put up the weekend of Deltopia, especially the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>Jacob Lebell, an Isla Vista resident, said the fences were “insulting,” “unnecessary” and “intolerable.”</p>\n<p>In response to these complaints, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to direct staff to request that no fencing be installed on El Colegio Road during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Camarena revealed that barricades will be placed on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road during the weekend and said any cars that leave that area during the weekend will not be allowed to re-enter due to concerns of cars being vandalized.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and the Isla Vista Tenants Union will be advertising for students not to park in those areas by going door-to-door, according to EVPLA Batsheva Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>If cars are parked on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road, they will not be towed, Camarena said.</p>\n<p>The CSD unanimously passed a third motion to direct staff to find alternative parking for residents. Director Spencer Brandt suggested that the parking lot of the Community Center be used as alternative parking for residents during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>A noise ordinance in Isla Vista will be in effect from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. throughout the weekend of Deltopia, according to Gina Fischer, representative for Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>The CSD released an online survey to ask UCSB students about their plans for Deltopia and their opinions on police presence.</p>\n<p>Results from 335 responses revealed that the majority of students were unsatisfied with law enforcement presence during Deltopia last year; however, most students still said they felt safe throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>The survey also revealed that 64 percent of responders discourage their friends from visiting I.V. during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>The CSD emphasized that in order for an ideal Deltopia to become a reality, there must be a balance between the students’ desires and the community’s desires in regard to police presence.</p>\n<p>Last year, the university spent an estimated <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">$30,000 to $40,000</a> on advertisements urging visitors to stay away from Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>This year, the university expects to spend less on Deltopia ads — specifically, in the $20,000–$30,000 range, according to Andrea Estrada, UCSB director of news and media relations. A final figure will not be determined until after Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

The freshman picked up his third win after going eight innings, allowing seven hits and one earned run while striking out five batters.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s game, the Gauchos picked up some great momentum after winning its Big West opener thanks to great hitting.</p>\n<p>UCSB started off the game sluggish down 2-0 after pitcher Shane Bieber allowed two runs in the bottom half of the first inning courtesy of junior catcher Daniel Jackson’s RBI single and sophomore outfielder Brock Lundquist’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara responded quickly with two runs of its own in the top of the second frame as Bush hit a solo shot homer and sophomore Josh Adams was able to score on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitchers settled down and took control of the plate again as the score was 2-2 until the top of the fifth when the Gauchos took the lead for the first time after Calica hit a solo shot home-run to make the score 3-2.</p>\n<p>The Dirtbags were able to respond in the seventh inning as they tied up the game at three apiece when Hampson hit a one-shot homer. Beiber was relieved by Nelson after the homer.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took the lead once again immediately in the top of the next frame as it again scored on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>Nelson then took the game into his hand as he retired the four of the final five batters picking up his then third save of the season.</p>\n<p>Although there were moments of sluggish batting/pitching, UCSB managed to put together another excellent weekend, the first of conference play, and start the Big West season the right way.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also able to show that they are capable of winning road games against tough opponents as they were able to take a series from the No. 16 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>Now as it takes a week off from conference play coming up, it will be interesting to see if Santa Barbara can stay grounded and stay focused.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is Friday, April 8 against College of Charleston at C of C Baseball Stadium at Patriot’s Point at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
