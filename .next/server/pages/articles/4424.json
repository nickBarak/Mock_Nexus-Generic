Participants can decorate a pot and plant a succulent to take home, make an earth cup with worms and edible grass and help create a chalk mural. For those interested in learning about composting, the A.S. Department of Public Worms and the Santa Barbara County Waste Division will be teaming up for a home composting workshop from 12-1 p.m. There will be fresh hummus and vegetables provided to munch on.</p>\n<p><strong>UNAPOLOGETICALLY PROUD</strong><br>\nThis year’s Pride Week will be going out with a bang with the Unapologetic Carnival on Saturday from 12-3 p.m. in People’s Park. There will be food, prizes, entertainment and a variety of booths including but not limited to a Polaroid/consent kissing booth and trans clothing swap. Highlights so far from this year’s Pride Week include visits from Jen Ruggirello and Niki Ang from BuzzFeed, a performance by Fratelli and a body-positive pool party.</p>\n<p><strong>LU’AU</strong><br>\nStudent organization Iaorana Te Otea will be hosting its annual lu’au this Saturday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park from 12-2 p.m. Iaorana Te Otea is a dance group on campus that mainly performs Polynesian dances such as the hula and ote’a. On Saturday, there will be a hula performance at 1 p.m. preceded by a potluck to be catered by L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbecue. Food will be $7. Various campus organizations will also be hosting activity tables where students can get henna tattoos and make paper leis.</p>\n<p><strong>EASTER’S EVE SHOW</strong><br>\nFor the live music fans out there, Grant Chesin, an indie pop singer-songwriter duo, will be hosting an Easter’s Eve show this Saturday night at 10 p.m. at 6750 Sabado Tarde Unit A. Not only will they be playing music, but they also will be telling “bad jokes” in between.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>REEL LOUD</strong><br>\nIn anticipation of the Reel Loud silent film festival in May, the Isla Vista Food Co-op will be screening films from last year’s festival next Wednesday at 8 p.m. Free snacks will be provided. For those who don’t know, Reel Loud is a UCSB film festival that allows filmmakers, artists, musicians and other performers to display their work in Campbell Hall. The festival only goes for one night, and it consists mostly of silent films accompanied by live music. However, there are also musical guests and performances between screenings that range anywhere from dance and a capella performances to stand-up comedy.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/vista-point-this-week-in-events/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/vista-point-this-week-in-events/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/vista-point-this-week-in-events/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/vista-point-this-week-in-events/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/vista-point-this-week-in-events/","id":4424,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4423,4422,4421],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Wristbands, Booked Bands and Booze Stands: I.V.

Community Services District (CSD) board president who led the march, said he saw the parade as a glimpse into the future of what Deltopia could be.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that everyone appreciated, and it was all fun, all positive,” he said. “That got me thinking, ‘Hey, if there’s more planned programming, I think that’s really the first step toward a ‘sanctioned Deltopia.’”</p>\n<p>Bertrand and other I.V. stakeholders have, for the past few years, proposed the idea of making Deltopia a sanctioned event. Rather than having the informal Spring Break celebration, they hope that someday Deltopia could be a planned festival of sorts — one with alcohol vending, booked performances or perhaps more Mardi Gras marches.</p>\n<p>“I think that it will be really important for us moving forward instead of just trying to see Deltopia as a problem we can put a Band-Aid on from a law enforcement perspective,” said Spencer Brandt, who also serves as a director on the CSD board.</p>\n<p>UCPD sent in approximately 70 officers into I.V. this weekend, the lowest in recent years, considering that police have had as many as 300 officers in town during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“We need to be doing what we can to bring it out into the open and regulate it,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he envisions a Deltopia where organizers are “distributing wristbands, having music in the parks [and] selling alcohol out in an open place where it is regulated and we know who is able to purchase it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76839\" data-attachment-id=\"76839\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-by-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia by McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76839 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some on the I.V.

A sanctioned Deltopia is an idea he is open to, he said.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t sound like bad thing,” he said. “This is my first year here, so I can’t really compare to anything else — like if it’d be a step up from something — but it doesn’t seem like a bad idea.”</p>\n<p>Brenda Cruz, a third-year communication major, said she thinks having a Deltopia festival would be “a lot more fun” and “a little more safe.”</p>\n<p>“Having it like an actual festival would be really fun [and] it’d be more controlled alcohol-wise, too, like being able to buy different kinds of alcohol, besides having just cheap stuff,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This growth has been a long time coming. He and his former business partner first approached their lawyer on Dec. 1, 2015; they launched over a month later on Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\n<p>Today, the Treehouse has between 850 and 1,000 customers.</p>\n<p>In the early days, he campaigned on foot with his friends by handing out flyers at fraternities, stapling them to telephone poles and handing out business cards as early as 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>These sacrifices haven’t ceased now that the business has grown. Barrett said his biggest challenge is the loss of his social life and youth. He cites stories of walking out during midterms because he had to answer business calls and driving all night with his friends to pick up product from San Francisco and be back before 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>“People think because I’m in this business I must smoke all the time, but I’ve never smoked less,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett now employs a UCSB senior, a recent graduate and two seasonal out-of-town workers. His former partner bowed out of the business due to parental backlash. However, the two remain on good terms.</p>\n<p>“I do cater to a lot of out-of-town patients, but the bread-and-butter daily routine is mostly from UCSB students,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett operates his company based on the “three Ps”: product, price and promptness. The Treehouse currently has the most five-star ratings in I.V. on Weedmaps, a source of pride for Barrett. He said all of the medicine sold is organic and that he goes out of his way to maintain the best quality.</p>\n<p>This attention to quality sometimes has financial consequences; one time he dropped a significant amount of product, which he then couldn’t sell. Product that dries before it can sell is taken off and slated for personal use rather than being sold to ensure that customers receive quality medicine.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that he doesn’t like the direction recreational marijuana use is going. While he isn’t against the principle, he believes it needs to be better regulated and that sellers need to consider what customers are putting into their bodies.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue facing the business is banking, Barrett said. Because marijuana is still a federally regulated substance, banks do not accept money made off marijuana. Barrett described this as an “annoyance,” citing safety concerns for himself and his staff, difficulties of being a cash-only business and backlash from customers who wish to use credit cards to pay.</p>\n<p>“Stop thinking that we’re drug dealers,” he said. “I work a lot of hours, over 100 a week easily, over 120 … I’m earning it.”</p>\n<p>With regulations constantly changing and Barrett shifting his focus more toward cultivation, the future of the I.V. Treehouse Collective is uncertain.</p>\n<p>“I get asked all the time, ‘Would you sell it, would you sell it?’ and the answer is I don’t want to. It’s like asking if you would sell your child,” he said. “But the way the laws are written they technically say delivery services will be banned.”</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks, he maintains hope for the future of the Treehouse. Cities like San Jose have started to issue registrations to allow dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana, giving hope that deliveries may not be completely banned.</p>\n<p>Barrett said he has also considered creating a physical storefront, but he was deterred by the amount of capital necessary.</p>\n<p>All profits he is making are going back into the business, particularly his farm. Though he lives comfortably, his lifestyle isn’t extravagant, and he pays his employees well.</p>\n<p>For Barrett personally, once he graduates he plans to leave Santa Barbara behind.</p>\n<p>“Monetarily, it makes a little bit more sense to be going up north,” he said. He plans to increase the cultivation side of the business and eventually use the proceeds to retire by 34 and move into other types of agriculture.</p>\n<p>“I love agriculture. I’ve always wanted to do crops, [but] it’s just expensive and marijuana’s a cash crop,” he said. “It got me into the industry I have always been dreaming of being in … I don’t have the money to buy 50 acres of almonds and start there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

There were incidents that took place, but overall it was a safe event,” Bertrand said. “I think it marks a continual culture change in Isla Vista for a safer Deltopia weekend.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he noticed much more community involvement in trying to keep Deltopia safe, as multiple organizations participated in keeping the atmosphere positive.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing much more community buy-in than we ever have before in the effort to make it a safe event,” he said. “In all of it [there were] people promoting positivity, people looking out for their neighbors, people connecting those in need with resources and just making sure that Deltopia is the safest event that it can be.”</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, board member of the I.V. CSD, spoke about the community’s feeling toward police, attributing the positive perception this year to the lack of horses. Freeman said the horses can give a negative impression and that fewer police helped improve the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the relationship between safety and entertainment is difficult to manage and he is unsure whether Deltopia has found the appropriate balance yet.</p>\n<p>“Safety is a trade-off, and we need to ask ourselves, ‘What amount of fun do we want to have for what amount of risk?’” Freeman said. “I do not know if Deltopia is at the right balance, but I do know that just trying to shut down parties and shut down events indiscriminately, yes, that will make things safer, but at what point do we simply say no music ever?”</p>\n<p>Police broke up approximately 12 parties because of “safety concerns” and alleged law violations, such as overcrowding, underage drinking and debris being thrown from balconies of residences.</p>\n<p>Hoover said crowds diminished after the noise ordinance was instituted at 6 p.m. and further dispersed after 7 p.m. to attend the university-sponsored concert, The Warm Up. The concert held its third iteration at the Thunderdome on Saturday, with artists Destructo and RL Grime taking the stage.</p>\n<p>University-led initiatives like The Warm Up and the UC Isla Vista (UCIV) program, as well as a county-instated festival ordinance from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., have aimed at minimizing unrest at Deltopia.</p>\n<p>UCIV, an Associated Students (A.S.) Public Safety Commission project, sent approximately 100 volunteers to notify students of the ordinance and other laws that would affect them, as well as hand out condoms, cookies and water, according to the commission’s chair Jenna Pack.</p>\n<p>Pack said she thought this year’s Deltopia was “1000-percent better” than the year before.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot less chaos, a lot less people, a lot less havoc,”  Pack said. “We saw a lot less crime going on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/","id":4423,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4422,4421,4420],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
