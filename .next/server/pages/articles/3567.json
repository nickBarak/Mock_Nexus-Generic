On the ground leading to the entrance of its lab lies a four-by-six white sheet, which at first seems insignificant in a room full of rainbow-colored filters and large machines that will build a network of telescopes. However, when someone steps on the sheet, it clings to the bottom of one’s shoes like tree sap and removes all traces of dirt.</p>\n<p>Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network Founder Wayne Rosing quickly walks through the large adhesive sheet and continues to conduct his tour of the laboratory.</p>\n<p>“This is a clean room to do highly clean work,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The cameras assembled in the room do not look like cameras at all. Instead, they look like large black boxes stacked on top of one another. It is hard to believe they cost $150,000.</p>\n<p>The next stop on the tour requires safety goggles. The machining room, which contains all the tools necessary to build a complete telescope, includes several pieces of equipment worth over $1 million. One of these machines is the vertical boring machine – a device used to shape cylindrical objects.</p>\n<p>The last stop of the tour leads outside the observatory to a shed in the parking lot. Inside the shed is Rosing’s prototype for one of his smallest telescopes: an approximately six-foot-tall cylindrical frame of metal. Connected to the structure is a computer, meant to document the telescope’s observations. The center of the metal frame holds a large, round, 40-centimeter in diameter mirror. This is definitely not a telescope meant for backyard observations. At the Las Cumbres Observatory, located at 6740 Cortona Dr., Rosing and his organization hope to build one of the world’s first intricate networks of telescopes across the globe.</p>\n<p>Do You See What I See?: A Global Network</p>\n<p>LCOGT is a privately funded, nonprofit scientific facility that plans to center its network of telescopes in Goleta. The organization will have all the telescopes connected via the Internet and will instantly pass on observations from one site to the next. LCOGT will deploy approximately 60 telescopes in at least six sites in different longitudes across the globe in both hemispheres, including Chile, South Africa, Australia, Hawaii and the Canary Islands.</p>\n<p>Lars Bildsten, a UCSB physics professor and theoretical astrophysicist, said the goal of LCOGT’s telescope project is to always have complete coverage of the sky. The project would also allow Bildsten to further his studies of the supernova – a large luminous explosion with the potential to radiate as much energy as the sun would emit over 10 billion years. Since supernovas only last a few weeks, being able to constantly observe them will make his research more thorough, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested from the theoretical side of new data the network will provide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said once the project is completed, the telescope will allow researchers to respond to satellite reports of activity in the atmosphere instantaneously. Since LCOGT will place telescopes in locations all over the world with different time zones, Rosing said it will not matter what time of the day it is; it is always dark enough to observe the sky in at least one location.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have the first capability ever implemented at being able to do a very long series of observations of things that go bump in the night,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Rosing, such 24-hour surveillance will allow the scientific community to learn new facts about the stars. For example, he said that currently the vibrations of new stars can only be watched for about eight hours at a time. Without being able to watch the star for 24 hours straight, astronomers cannot fully understand the frequency of the star’s oscillation, he said.</p>\n<p>Space Is the Place: The Journey Ahead</p>\n<p>By the end of 2012, Rosing said his global telescope network will consist of approximately 40 0.4-meter telescopes, 20 one-meter telescopes and two two-meter telescopes. Currently, Bildsten said there is no standard size for telescopes, but the biggest ones are 10 meters, located at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Matt Dubberly, an LCOGT mechanical engineer, said a one-meter telescope will collect 100 centimeters of light, which is a much greater amount of light than the human eye can handle. On average, the human pupil is between 5.5-0.8 millimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p>Dubberly also said that all the one-meter and two-meter telescopes will be attached to 16 megapixel spectral cameras.</p>\n<p>“The cameras are 1,000 times more sensitive than your eye,” Dubberly said. “They get really high resolution pictures of faint objects out in space.”</p>\n<p>LCOGT Scientific Director Tim Brown said the sites for the telescopes were determined by how easy it would be to transport the telescopes, and whether or not Internet connectivity was possible. He said it is important to have Internet connectivity because the telescopes must be able to send information back to the database in Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be independent in the sense that each one can point anywhere in the sky at any target that’s visible to it at anytime,” Brown said. “But it will all be controlled from a central location.”</p>\n<p>The telescopes can also follow instructions sent from the central computer in Goleta and observe the same targets, he said.</p>\n<p>Bildsten said most sites will have three one-meter telescopes in case one breaks down. Brown said having three one-meter telescopes on each site will allow LCOGT to conduct different studies simultaneously in fields such as photometry, in which researchers study light intensity, and spectroscopy – the study of a material’s chemical composition via the light emitted.</p>\n<p>LCOGT will complete the first prototype for the one-meter telescopes by early 2009, Rosing said. By the end of 2010, the organization will deploy all the 0.4-meter telescopes, and by 2012, it will place all of the one-meter telescopes. Currently, LCOGT manages the two two-meter telescopes, called the Faulkes Telescope North – located at Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii – and the Faulkes Telescope South – located at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia.</p>\n<p>In addition to building telescopes, Rosing said the organization will require large amounts of data space to store all the information collected by the telescopes.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be generating a few hundred gigs a night of information, which will flow back to the large cluster computing facility,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Even after all the telescopes are deployed, Rosing said the group must continue to maintain them by building and installing better cameras as detective technology improves.</p>\n<p>“Our plan for the next 20 years is to study and do as much science as we can,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Brown said site preparation expenses – pouring concrete, putting in power-lines, placing telescopes and acquiring permits – cost at least $50,000. In addition, he said the 0.4-meter telescopes cost around $50,000 each to build, and the one-meter telescopes cost approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>Universe-ity Collaboration</p>\n<p>Sometime between late summer and early autumn, Brown said LCOGT will place a 0.8-meter telescope at the UCSB-managed Sedgwick Reserve, located in the Santa Ynez Valley. This telescope will have an eyepiece on it, which means spectators can look through it, he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said he chose to deploy a telescope at Sedgwick because LCOGT needed a large telescope to test and a relatively close dark sky site to test it.</p>\n<p>“After discussing it, it was obvious to us that making a telescope available to UCSB astronomers and students in general was an added benefit,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Rosing said Sedgwick has many outreach programs and a telescope would benefit those programs.</p>\n<p>“Part of the night is what goes on up in the sky, and it would be nice to be able to see it,” Rosing said. “We can do that from Sedgwick because it’s dark.”</p>\n<p>Rosing said the majority of engineering and manufacturing and all the software developments are done within LCOGT. However, he said LCOGT has an extensive collaboration in the astronomy field, including seven to 10 postdoctoral fellows connected with UC astrophysicists, UCSB, the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley and the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>\n<p>In addition, Brown said LCOGT works with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope – an eight-meter telescope that will survey the entire sky and be operational in five years. Brown said the project also has other collaborations, including SuperWASP, a British organization that searches for new planets.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Jan. 7, 2019, called his $144 billion budget a “California For All” plan that places emphasis on “building a foundation for the American dream.”</p>\n<p>“During my inaugural speech, I described the California Dream as a house we are building together,” Newsom said in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/01/10/governor-newsom-proposes-2019-20-california-for-all-state-budget/\">press release</a>. “That wasn’t just a speech device – it’s exactly what we are proposing today. To make the California Dream available to all, our state must be fiscally sound.”</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Board of Regents were quick to praise Newsom’s budget, calling it a “welcome step and a solid down payment” for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“These funds help further the academic mission of the university, from student success to classroom upgrades, financial aid to timely graduations,” UCOP and the Regents said in joint statement released soon after the budget plan was announced.</p>\n<p>Gov. Newsom’s funds for the UC are mainly split into three parts: $240 million toward an ongoing general fund, $138 million as one-time payment and $15 million to increase degree completion and programs at UC extension centers, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>The ongoing general fund will fund finance operating costs, efforts to increase student success, improving student mental health services and helping to address homelessness and student hunger; the one-time fund will address the UC’s deferred maintenance backlog.</p>\n<p>“These investments are provided with the expectation that tuition will remain flat, access will be increased, and time to degree will improve,” the budget states.</p>\n<p>This $400 million is <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/brown-signs-budget-act-of-2018-increases-funding-to-uc/\">an increase</a> from the $346 million that former Gov. Brown allocated in the Budget Act of 2018.</p>\n<p>Newsom’s budget took into account the UC’s “significant growth” over the past decade. Enrollment for the UC system rose from about 230,000 students in 2010 compared to 270,000 for fall 2017, a 19.2 percent increase, according to the budget.</p>\n<p>For UC Santa Barbara, this was 22,000 in 2010 to approximately 25,000 students for Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Within the $400 million allotted, there is also a designated $5.3 million toward mental health services – with the goal of allowing campuses to hire additional clinicians –– and $15 million toward addressing student hunger and housing needs.</p>\n<p>Approximately $1.3 million for an immigration legal services program is also designated, to begin in 2022-23.</p>\n<p>The budget also included a $1 million fund toward supporting UC Davis’ Firearms Violence Research Center, beginning in 2021-22.</p>\n<p>Newsom will not sign the budget until June, after the California legislature has voted on it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Jan. 7, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence and Sofia Mejias-Pascoe can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

photo)</em></p></div>\n<p>“UC already has clear policies and procedures in place that protect anyone’s right to peacefully protest or speak on our campuses.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, March 2, President Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he discussed the executive order.</p>\n<p>“I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars,” President Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>\n<p>“Everyday we’re restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right and we believe in religious liberty,” he added.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President’s (UCOP) statement cited the UC as being the home of the free speech movement in the 1960s, along with the fact that UC campuses have hosted conservative speakers including Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager and Dinesh D’Souza.</p>\n<p>The UC has also established a National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement, which is “dedicated to exploring issues and challenges related to free expression through research, advocacy, debate and discussion,” according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referred to an incident when a representative of a conservative group was assaulted at UC Berkeley, adding that “the university acted swiftly.”</p>\n<p>“The campus released a statement strongly condemning the incident and expressing support for the police department’s efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice,” the statement said. “Chancellor Carol Christ also sent a campus-wide message reaffirming UC Berkeley’s commitment to freedom of expression.”</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano said the UC does not need the federal government to mandate free speech on college campuses, as it is already mandated.</p>\n<p>“Free speech is a fundamental value of the University of California and we already have strong policies in place that protect the free expression of ideas, regardless of political persuasion,” Napolitano said. “Protecting free expression has been part of the University of California’s DNA for decades.”</p>\n<p>College Republicans President Leslie Garcia, however, has differing views.</p>\n<p>Garcia said that Trump’s proposed executive order is an “incredible idea.”</p>\n<p>Garcia, a fourth-year political science and middle east studies double major, added that in the time she’s been at UCSB, “college conservatives have seen how far campus administrators and more left-leaning people are willing to go to shut down the discourse.”</p>\n<p>Garcia referenced when Ben Shapiro came to UCSB, and said that although there was a “leftist outcry” against Ben Shapiro, “the event was still funded and successful.”</p>\n<p>However, UC Berkeley had not been so lucky due to leftist groups enacting violence in a quest to shut down free speech, she added.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump spoke of his intent to issue the executive order, it is unclear when he will officially issue the executive order.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Seasoned trial lawyers and fresh faces out of law school knew that with a gavel in hand, the UCSB criminal justice professor was intelligent, probing and unpredictable all at once. His courtroom was his domain.</p>\n<p>After presiding over thousands of cases, the judge’s friends and co-workers – both in and out of the legal profession – are certain of one thing: The honorable Joe Lodge was absolutely committed to the ideals of his profession.</p>\n<p>“He tried very hard to bring justice to a coarse, harsh system,” said Benjamin Bycel, a prominent criminal attorney tapped to teach the remainder of Lodge’s criminal justice class at UCSB. “Joe tried to bring humanity and ethics into it. He wasn’t successful all the time and he was criticized for it, but his desire to consider the uniqueness of every case was well-respected.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When Lodge pulled into Santa Barbara in the late fifties things were different, Chief Assistant District Attorney Pat McKinley said. In Goleta and the surrounding area, the law was handed down through a Justice Court that met maybe two times a week – and judges did not even have to be lawyers.</p>\n<p>In 1958, the Goleta-Hope Ranch Justice Court judge was no lawyer. Senior Deputy District Attorney and friend Darryl Perlin said Lodge, fresh out of law school, decided to take a chance and give the incumbent a run for his money.</p>\n<p>“Joe Lodge, who knew very few people, did something which today is considered standard operating procedure in political campaigns, but back in 1958 it was unheard of,” Perlin said. “He decided that he would walk the precincts and introduce himself.”</p>\n<p>Lodge won the seat narrowly and never got up from the bench. Over the next half century, Lodge presided over his court in spite of severe back pain and a ten-year battle with lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“Judge Lodge could have retired 30 years ago at full salary but he didn’t,” Perlin said. “The reason was because of his love of the law and the job he did every day. He never missed work.”</p>\n<p>“You never knew exactly what to expect from him on the bench and I believe that’s exactly the way he wanted it,” William Makler, a defense attorney and former public defender, said</p>\n<p>Senior Deputy District Attorney Joyce Dudley said she first met the judge when she was just 19 years old. Lodge had ruled on a ticket she received for having an unleashed dog and she recalled how he told her to “sit” when she stood up out of place. The judge, she said, was sensitive and inquisitive but stood firm by his opinions.</p>\n<p>“He was a force,” Dudley said. “The man embraced life, embraced philosophy, embraced the law, embraced justice, and he was never interested in winning any popularity contests in terms of his rulings.”</p>\n<p>McKinley said that it is a known fact that plenty of lawyers disagreed with Lodge and that it was not easy to foresee his rulings.</p>\n<p>“He was unpredictable – unpredictable for both sides,” McKinley said.</p>\n<p>However, according to McKinley and Perlin, Lodge’s unpredictability was proof that he shot from the hip – and the fact that attorneys in court rarely moved to disqualify him is just the “proof in the pudding.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, a gala party was thrown for Lodge at the Montecito Country Club. The affair was, as his wife Sheila put it, “in lieu of” a retirement party. She said the judge was not about to step down from the bench.</p>\n<p>Perlin said it was also thrown because “it was not thought that he had much longer to live.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Lodge had been living with lymphoma for four years, McKinley said.</p>\n<p>“He handled [lymphoma] with a dignity and an openness that is rare in today’s day and age,” McKinley said. “He never really expressed fear of it. He beat back the cancer three or four times.”</p>\n<p>Perlin said that throughout Lodge’s battle with cancer, he continued to serve as a judge and professor.</p>\n<p>“Many a time, he would go for a cancer treatment in the morning and as soon as he had received it, he would be back on the bench as though nothing had happened,” Perlin said.</p>\n<p>According to Perlin, Lodge was a judge who would not quit, as he even out-lived his “memorial” party by six years.</p>\n<p>“It’s not often someone gets to come to their going-away party,” Perlin said. “But Joe Lodge didn’t go away.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16729\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16729\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/","id":3566,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3565,3564,3563],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
