To examine the limitations of the First Amendment, inspecting the concept of freedom of speech is a good place to start. The First Amendment does not allow individuals to say whatever they want, whenever they want. The classic example that is often taught in high school settings is the metaphor of “shouting fire in a crowded theater.” Originating from the 1919 Supreme Court case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schenck v. United States</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “clear and present danger” test prohibits the </span><a href=\"https://lawshelf.com/videos/entry/freedom-of-speech-exceptions-categories-of-speech-not-protected\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incitement of “imminent lawless action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” Additionally, there are </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight other</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> types of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, including obscenity, solicitations to commit crimes, blackmail, true threats, perjury, child pornography, fighting words and defamation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the First Amendment does prevent Congress from limiting one’s freedom of speech, it doesn’t guarantee freedom from consequences — especially from private entities. In the ever-growing age of social media, employers can easily monitor an employee’s behavior off the clock. There have been </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">numerous instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of employees being fired for tweets or public comments they have made. In 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16110696/firing-google-ceo-employee-penned-controversial-memo-on-women-has-violated-its-code-of-conduct\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google fired an employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made a controversial memo that claimed “women had biological issues that prevented them from being as successful as men in tech.” This event demonstrates how the First Amendment’s freedom of speech does not protect citizens from the consequences of expressing their views. </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lata Nott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the executive director of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, makes the point that “it’s the company’s right to discipline their employees’ speech.” This right only applies to private companies, such as in the Google case above. While it may seem like firing an employee over their views infringes on their freedom of speech, the First Amendment has no jurisdiction here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the concept of freedom under the First Amendment may sound universally appealing, its power has been misconstrued, used to discriminate and infringe on the rights of others. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the First Amendment does not protect against being banned on a social media platform. In 2018, Alex Jones, host of the infamous InfoWars, had </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645352618/twitter-bans-alex-jones-and-infowars-cites-abusive-behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his Twitter account permanently suspended</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This led to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, that tech companies were attempting to suppress conservatives online. Despite Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yelling that the United States has freedom of speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment does not protect against this type of action by private companies. The First Amendment prohibits censorship by the government </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— but</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not by private organizations. To be clear, I am not arguing about the ethics of censorship; I am making the argument that these companies have a right to bar and add consequences to certain speech. Proclaiming that such actions violate the First Amendment and one’s freedom of speech are inaccurate statements that misconstrue the actual meaning of the amendment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect of the First Amendment is the freedom of religion. The amendment states that the government cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/your-right-religious-freedom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Civil Liberties Union</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment prevents the government from establishing or promoting religion in any way and gives individuals the right to worship or not worship as they choose, without punishment. Although this clause in the First Amendment is important, its intent and actual protections have been misconstrued. Religious freedom does not protect one from infringing on others’ rights. Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place. Prior to the civil rights era, racial segregationists justified their actions through scripture and religion. Segregationists argued that black people were inferior to white people, referring to their interpretations of the Bible. This appropriation of the Bible thus legally allowed segregationists to claim that hiring black people would violate their religious beliefs. These legal arguments based on religion would not hold today; however, back then, there were no legal protections for marginalized groups. With the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is now official legal framework that denies discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In more recent events, the First Amendment’s assurance of religious freedom has been misconstrued by individuals to justify discrimination against marginalized groups; these actions often go against different pieces of federal legislation, turning the words “religious freedom” into a buzzword. For example, in 2015, Kim Davis garnered national notoriety for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even after the legalization of gay marriage through </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obergefell v. Hodges</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite the legalization, Davis refused to comply and claimed her right to religious freedom by saying that she made the decision “</span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/01/436557085/despite-high-court-ruling-kentucky-clerk-denies-gay-marriage-licences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under God’s authority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This claim is not only misrepresentative of what religious freedom actually is but also uses the buzzword to discriminate. After Davis was forced by the court to issue marriage licenses, she still refused and later was held in </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/us/when-businesses-can-deny-you-service-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contempt of court</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Religion is not an inherently discriminatory idea; however, the usage of religious freedom to masquerade discriminatory practices is a misinterpretation of the First Amendment’s religious protections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the First Amendment being a part of one of the most well-known pieces of American legislation, its actual meaning and applicable situations have been misconstrued and used as a guise to discriminate. The next time an individual proclaims that they have the religious freedom to discriminate against certain patrons or argues that their free speech is being violated when they are banned from a social media platform, double check if they are actually protected under the First Amendment or if they are just throwing around a buzzword.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Tran has the freedom of speech to correct others on their actual First Amendment protections.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/","id":6459,"author":{"id":794,"name":"Justin Tran"},"related":[6458,6457,6456],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":794,"name":"Justin Tran","biography":"Not available","articles":[6459],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Cyber Stalking Sucks the Sexy Out of One-Night Stands","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Remember the good ol’ days?

A simpler time of land lines, missed connections and face-to-face breakups. When a drunken booty call came from the sound of pebbles ricocheting off your window and flirting didn’t involve a keyboard and a series of nervous acronyms. It seems that we’re so busy LOLing we can’t even hear each other laugh out loud anymore.</p>\n<p>If I can be real here for a moment: I feel like I’m in a fucking relationship with Facebook. It’s there when I go to sleep and when I wake up, I can turn it on and I’m on it all the time.

If a dick gets wood in a forest and there’s no Facebook page to prove I mounted it, did we ever fuck?</p>\n<p>The truth of the matter is Facebook stalking is as much a part of hooking up as the boner pop. And when profile hunting gets bunched in as a type of foreplay, it becomes more and more clear that anonymity is a thing of the past. We can friend without fucking, but can we fuck without friending?</p>\n<p>What is it about clicking through the high school prom photos of some acquaintance you just met, whilst casually noticing how much totally hotter you clearly are than his or her ex, that gets us through the workday? We are no longer merely addicted to Facebook, we’re addicted to the chase of learning mundane information about people we hardly know. Are we detectives minus the oversized pipe and magnifying lens or just plain creepy?</p>\n<p>The best is the searching. You’re like, OK what do I know? She said she was in a sorority, mentioned that she prefers long boarding over biking to school, her shirt was green and I think she has a nut allergy. Searching networks for … “anti-peanut environmentalist skater sister.” Fuck! OK, how about friends of friends? Who did she say her ex-boyfriend’s cousin was again? Sweet, got her! Fuck, limited profile. What do animals do in the wild do when their prey’s search is blocked?</p>\n<p>The real question I’m grappling with is this: Now that we’ve made our lives so public, is there really such a thing as a one-night stand these days? If you have a guy in your private box one night, chances are a friend request will be waiting for you in your public one soon after. I hate to sound like a detached bitch, but have we reached the end of anonymous boning as we know it?</p>\n<p>I’m starting to fear a lack of mystery in my sexual endeavors. If Shakespeare had a Twitter, he’d probably annoy the shit out of me. Of course, there really isn’t much you can know about a person based on their favorite quote from “American Pie 2” and the fact that they read and liked Catcher in the Rye, but having access to a person’s profile seems like a buzzkill in the sexy mysteriousness department.</p>\n<p>On a more positive note, we can enjoy exploiting things like Facebook to track the lame lives of lovers past. There’s something extremely cathartic in knowing that your ex attends fewer cool events than you and has ugly, pouty-face whores trolling around his pictures. A “had a bad day” status here and an unflattering picture tag there keeps us trekking along.</p>\n<p>So if we can accept the reality of our cyber-reality sex lives, we can adapt and grow into 21st century sex habits. Don’t get creeped out when a fling is lurking around your updates, because you’re guilty of the same.</p>\n<p>I say we embrace the lack of anonymity we’re faced with. I’ll start: SF is fucking @John Doe tonight. What’s on my mind? Sex, motherfucker. Did I get hacked by my asshole friends who wrote, “likes getting railed by black cock”? Nope, that would be my doing. Just your basic, clear, to-the-point updates on my life. Like that, bitches.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

opioids</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for his back pain after the accident. He started taking more and more pills, eventually increasing his dosage from one pill to 25 pills a day. His mother described her opioid-addicted son as a completely different person from who he was before. He was withdrawn,  hostile and refused to seek treatment leading up to his death from an overdose only two years after the accident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie’s mother June has </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rxawareness/stories/katie.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">struggled with addiction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ever since Katie was a young girl. June was always in and out of Katie’s life, creating a troubling environment for her to grow up in. Upon reflection, Katie understands this had less to do with who her mother was and far more to do with the terrible effects opioids can have on a person. Her mother felt like she needed the drugs and would do almost anything to continue taking them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cases of Christopher and June are simply two out of hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from opioid addiction in this country. The opioid crisis has sent shockwaves through the country as horrifying numbers of people have died from overdoses and many continue to battle their addictions. In the past few weeks, there have been </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/opioid-epidemic-companies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the people closest to the proliferation of this tragic trend — the executives of the pharmaceutical companies. By no means are these companies innocent bystanders to everything that has occurred. While talks of settlement mark some progress in achieving justice for the victims and ameliorating the damage done, it is simply not enough. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pharmaceutical companies were directly involved in </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggressive marketing strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that resulted in doctors overprescribing dangerous and addictive painkillers.

According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinstoller/2019/08/28/under-proposed-purdue-pharma-opioid-settlement-sacklers-would-still-be-billionaires/#1075ef2a1625\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even if the Sackler family agreed to a settlement, they would still be worth between $1 to $2 billion.  </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pointed out in the October Democratic debate that this is an example of the injustice plaguing the criminal justice system. She called for “an America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don’t get museum wings named after them; they go to jail.” The wealthy have been able to buy their way out of punishment for blatantly committing crimes in this country for too long. They should not be considered above the law simply because of the amount of money they have. Senator Kamala Harris </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also touched upon this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referring to the ramifications of the opioid crisis as a “matter of justice and accountability.” Pharmaceutical executives need to be held accountable for their actions — actions which have resulted in more than </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/opioid-epidemic-companies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200,000 deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call for criminal prosecution against those most directly involved in the opioid crisis is by no means unprecedented. A few months ago, top executives of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/3/18528123/insys-fentanyl-trial-verdict-john-kapoor-opioid-epidemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insys Therapeutics </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were convicted of criminal racketeering for their role in the crisis. They were found to have been paying doctors to overprescribe opioids and falsely advertise its pain management capabilities. There is </span><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2089370/effectiveness-risks-long-term-opioid-therapy-chronic-pain-systematic-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barely any evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> correlating the effectiveness of opioids with treating chronic pain and there is certainly not enough for them to have been prescribed at such a high rate. While it is an important step that the Insys executives were convicted on criminal charges, it is important to note that their founder, John Kapoor, whose net worth before this was </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/02/insys-therapeutics-john-kapoor-found-guilty-fentanyl-bribery-case/3561518002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is a person of color. It does not sit right that he is one of the few executives who has been prosecuted while no member of the Sackler family, all white, has been subjected to the criminal justice system. This only furthers the notion that being a rich, white male in this country is considered an appropriate exemption from receiving the same treatment as anyone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This begs the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered a criminal act to kill a person in a car accident. It is considered a criminal act to kill a person through an armed robbery. This raises the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans. They have lied and cheated their way through the medical system only to receive more profit in the process. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/10/20881636/sacklers-purdue-opioid-epidemic-prison-prosecution-criminal-investigation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Sackler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently stated that “we have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are the reckless criminals.” Not only is this is a completely inaccurate deflection of blame, but it also shows how pharmaceutical executives will do anything to deny their role in the crisis. Our criminal justice system needs to treat everyone the same way. It needs to play a more active role in fixing the opioid epidemic and punishing those most involved. How else will this country establish that its notions of justice are not contingent upon socioeconomic status?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop believes that all pharmaceutical executives involved in the opioid crisis should face criminal prosecution and serious prison time for the countless deaths they have caused.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

And why are certain numbers better than others? It’s almost like the way we view age. Double-digits is a big step, twenty is the end of an era and thirty is scary as fuck. Which sex number bracket is socially acceptable at which age? And who decides?</p>\n<p>I’m sorry to break it to you, but if I can have all the “meaningless” sex I want, yet it still “counts,” there’s no way it’s actually devoid of meaning. Sex always means something, whether that meaning is love, releasing tension, loneliness, friendship or self-consciousness.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I don’t think that having “meaningless” notches on your belt is something to be embarrassed about. The numbers you may technically regret make the ones you esteem all the more wonderful. We keep an inventory on our crotch’s social life because our sexual history is part of who we are. And there’s always something to be learned from the past.</p>\n<p>Men, since the day your voice first squeaked, you have been under a ridiculous amount of pressure to shove your junk into the nearest receptacle as soon as possible. Your number immediately became a way to measure your masculinity. I think it goes without saying that this is extremely unfair and, if I may add, unfounded.</p>\n<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with a good player — someone has to be out there ballin’ the field, taking one for the team, dominating the game — but that shit only matters among you guys. For girls, the amount of tail hunted does not separate the boys from the men. Dudes are putting this pressure on each other, and I just thought you should know, we like you just the way you are.</p>\n<p>Women, you take a lot of shit for your sexual resumes. Your number determines whether you’re an angel or a devil, and makes you self-conscious about being too “loose.” (P.S. When the fuck did this “loose” label come to exist? Vaginas are like blowfish, people — they always retract.) I know, we’re all sick of hearing the old, “It’s so unfair that a high-numbered dame is a slut, while a well worn-in dick is an accomplished prizewinner,” but alas, I’ll say it again for reinforcement.</p>\n<p>It seems that in the number game, no one’s a winner. It’s a balance we can’t achieve. The best we can hope for is quality and quantity evening out.</p>\n<p>So it’s time to just be who you are, closet sex skeletons and all, and own your digits.</p>\n<p>Plus, they say that when you sleep with someone you’re sleeping with everyone that person has ever slept with. Thinking about the statistic of how many people I’ve paid it forward to in that regard makes me want to close down my muffin shop. Holy shit.</p>\n<p>I’m no mathematician, but there’s one equation I can vouch for with confidence. X + pride = the perfect number.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40044\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-25/ignore-social-stigmas-wear-number-pride/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40044\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-25/ignore-social-stigmas-wear-number-pride/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-25/ignore-social-stigmas-wear-number-pride/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-25/ignore-social-stigmas-wear-number-pride/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-25/ignore-social-stigmas-wear-number-pride/","id":6458,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6457,6456,6455],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
