Interns must work at least 10 hours a week and will work directly with their assigned director on whatever projects they are asked to help with.</p>\n<p>The program, which is funded by Associated Students and a private donor, hires interns in collaboration with UCSB and plans to contract new students every quarter. This quarter there were 45 applications for the program, of which 12 were interviewed and three were selected.</p>\n<p>Alison Keleher, undergraduate program coordinator for the political science department, interviewed the 12 applicants who made it to the interview stage and said she felt confident any of the 12 could be hired.</p>\n<p>Applicants were required to have junior or senior standing with relevant experience in government.</p>\n<p>Applications were released on March 22 through the political science major mailing list and were due by March 30. By April 5, the final three students were selected and ready to be hired. Keleher said the process was swift, as the department had “very short notice” to interview and select candidates, but he said they were happy to help.</p>\n<p>“So it was all very quick, which is unusual around here. Things don’t usually move that quickly because it’s just not how the university works,” Keleher said. “But we were asked because the I.V. CSD needs to get up and running and they need staff help.”</p>\n<p>As of this quarter, the program is run through the political science department, though students with relevant experience are considered despite their major. Keleher said she is excited about the program and “wish[es] all the interns an exciting and learning-filled quarter.”<br>\nThe three spring 2017 interns for the I.V.

There were incidents that took place, but overall it was a safe event,” Bertrand said. “I think it marks a continual culture change in Isla Vista for a safer Deltopia weekend.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he noticed much more community involvement in trying to keep Deltopia safe, as multiple organizations participated in keeping the atmosphere positive.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing much more community buy-in than we ever have before in the effort to make it a safe event,” he said. “In all of it [there were] people promoting positivity, people looking out for their neighbors, people connecting those in need with resources and just making sure that Deltopia is the safest event that it can be.”</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, board member of the I.V. CSD, spoke about the community’s feeling toward police, attributing the positive perception this year to the lack of horses. Freeman said the horses can give a negative impression and that fewer police helped improve the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the relationship between safety and entertainment is difficult to manage and he is unsure whether Deltopia has found the appropriate balance yet.</p>\n<p>“Safety is a trade-off, and we need to ask ourselves, ‘What amount of fun do we want to have for what amount of risk?’” Freeman said. “I do not know if Deltopia is at the right balance, but I do know that just trying to shut down parties and shut down events indiscriminately, yes, that will make things safer, but at what point do we simply say no music ever?”</p>\n<p>Police broke up approximately 12 parties because of “safety concerns” and alleged law violations, such as overcrowding, underage drinking and debris being thrown from balconies of residences.</p>\n<p>Hoover said crowds diminished after the noise ordinance was instituted at 6 p.m. and further dispersed after 7 p.m. to attend the university-sponsored concert, The Warm Up. The concert held its third iteration at the Thunderdome on Saturday, with artists Destructo and RL Grime taking the stage.</p>\n<p>University-led initiatives like The Warm Up and the UC Isla Vista (UCIV) program, as well as a county-instated festival ordinance from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., have aimed at minimizing unrest at Deltopia.</p>\n<p>UCIV, an Associated Students (A.S.) Public Safety Commission project, sent approximately 100 volunteers to notify students of the ordinance and other laws that would affect them, as well as hand out condoms, cookies and water, according to the commission’s chair Jenna Pack.</p>\n<p>Pack said she thought this year’s Deltopia was “1000-percent better” than the year before.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot less chaos, a lot less people, a lot less havoc,”  Pack said. “We saw a lot less crime going on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/","id":4423,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4422,4421,4420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: This Week’s Goings-On","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week's Vista Point includes a silent film screening, live music at an Easter Eve show and a body-positive pool party.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>GO GREEN</strong><br>\nEarth Month is in full swing, and the Isla Vista Food Cooperative is celebrating by hosting various activities from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. that are fun for the whole family.
