Pepperdine junior starting pitcher Matt Maurer improved to 1-1 on the year while the Gauchos freshman pitcher Hector Lujan fell to 0-1 in his first start this season.</p>\n<p>With the win, the Waves improve to 16-11 on the year while the Gauchos fall to 14-13 as they continue to sit in the middle of the pack in the Big West Conference at 1-2 in league play.</p>\n<p>The trouble began right away in the first inning when freshman second baseman Hutton Moyer led off the game with a double into right center on the first pitch of the game. The trouble continued and led to the first run of the game when sophomore third baseman Austin Davidson reached base on a fielding error by the Gauchos Woody Woodward and Moyer scored.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lujon escaped the inning without allowing another run but was then touched up again in the second inning for the second run of the game when junior left fielder Chris Amezquita led off with a home run into deep left field.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos retaliated for their first and only run in the bottom of the third.

The Mustangs will come down for a Friday 3 p.m. game, Saturday 2 p.m. game and a Sunday early afternoon showdown at 1p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50645\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50645\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/ucsb-drops-contest-against-pepperdine/","id":4666,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4665,4664,4663],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Until the November 2016 voting period, studies will be conducted to determine how financially plausible this plan is.<em> Online Stock Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Governor Jerry Brown signed Assemblymember Das Williams’ Isla Vista self-governance bill, Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), into law Wednesday.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, I.V. residents will vote on the establishment of I.V. as a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives, which would determine local services and infrastructure projects. If approved by voters, the CSD would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Until November 2016 the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) will conduct an analysis of the financial feasibility of a CSD for I.V.</p>\n<p>Field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus Cameron Schunk said the next step for Williams’ staff will be to assist the Board of Supervisors and LAFCO in their feasibility study to provide reliable information for 2016 voters.</p>\n<p>“The way the bill is written, it goes to a vote regardless of what LAFCO’s analysis says,” Schunk said. “Our hope, though, is to work as closely with LAFCO as possible to get the best possible analysis, which provides usable and accurate information. This really gives voters confidence when they go to the ballot, one way or another.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, representatives from Williams’ office will continue to educate residents about the CSD in stakeholder meetings every Tuesday night in the I.V. Clinic.</p>\n<p>“As far as our Tuesday night meetings, we fleshed out a schedule of events where we will be delving deep into each of the services, fleshing out how the community would like to see them enacted, what sort of contract we would want to draw out and how much we would be looking to spend on various things,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said her office will be working to educate students about the advantages of a CSD in I.V.</p>\n<p>“A large part of this, of which the EVPLA office is going to take part, is voter education,” Dela Cruz said. “I hope to inform students of the benefits of AB 3 and also anything that might affect them.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said A.S. needs to continue providing support to the I.V. self-governance movement to ensure the success of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to support any people, power and financial resources we can to ensure that it’s a successful election and start it right,” Villarreal said. “There are people who haven’t heard [about a CSD], so we want to continue with the educational process.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, the 50-year-old movement for I.V. self-governance recently gained momentum because of support from I.V residents, the university, elected officials and other local agencies.</p>\n<p>“In the past, there were entities purposely road-blocking the efforts — LAFCO and the university were actively against those efforts and Isla Vista was powerless against these established organizations,” Abboud said. “This go around, we have a lot of allies that have really assisted us in getting this through officially.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he is “cautiously optimistic” I.V. residents will vote in favor of a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I think that the community has had enough with the status quo,” Abboud said. “There’s a lot of energy to change the status quo and this is a chance to do so.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/i-v-self-governance-bill-approved/","id":4663,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4662,4661,4660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Face Pepperdine at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_8300-by-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_8300-by-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB kicks off Spring Quarter with a home game today against Pepperdine University.

As a result, the Gauchos’ Big West record remains just 1-2, leaving them in sixth in the early goings of league play.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could trade that [win],” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were not originally supposed to play a fourth one but Hawaii was short games and whenever you go to Hawaii those games don’t count towards your 56 game maximum, so we picked up the game, but I wish we could trade it with one of the losses.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pepperdine makes the trip to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with a 15-11 record and a strong 6-3 West Coast Conference record. The Waves are coming off a three game series at BYU where they dropped the first two games in Utah before taking the final game of the series 9-6. Pepperdine will be concluding its five game road trip today.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine sophomore catcher Kolten Yamaguchi went 3-5 in the final game of the series against BYU and drove in two runs. In fact, Yamaguchi has been on a tear as of late. He has played in just 13 of the Waves 26 games, but leads the team with a .396 batting average, is tied for the team lead with four home runs and leads the team with a .688 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon headline the gaucho offense. Both had solid weekends in Hawaii as each drove in three runs. Trinkwon broke out in a big way in the final game in Hawaii with two hits, including a homerun, two runs scored and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Kuresa has continued his dominance as the most dangerous hitter in the Gauchos lineup. He has his average up to .294 with team leading seven doubles, two triples and a homerun, while his 20 RBI rank sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We are facing a left hander and we have swung the bats pretty well against left handers, so that’s in our favor.” Checketts said. “The lineup is also getting easier to write out because we have so many injuries right now and don’t have a whole lot of options. We had a really good effort by Dalton Kelly on the last weekend so he will be out there again.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outfielder Kelly went 6-11 with two triples and six RBI while in Hawaii to make a name for himself in this Gaucho lineup and out performed most anyone on the road trip.</p>\n<p>Heading into Tuesday’s game the Gauchos will be starting their third freshman starting pitcher in the last three games as the long weekend has taken its toll on the staff.</p>\n<p>“We are going to have to staff the game [today].” Checketts said. “We are a little thin on the mound and we used a lot of guys so Hector Lujan will start for us. He will go probably just a couple innings then we will use everyone else for an inning or so.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is slated for 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of

offering new bites and the same laid-back vibes Isla Vistans have come to love since its inception.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by A.S. Program Board and offered free food from Woodstock’s Pizza, C’est Cheese, China Pavilion at Chapala and Kyle’s Kitchen. It also featured performances by local musicians Choice, Kaysin and The Real Savage Henry.</p>\n<p>The slogan of the festival was “your fees, your fest,” and Christina Chiocchi of the Program Board emphasized the group’s goal to address student hunger. The need for food can be “so real” in college, she said.</p>\n<p>Students also need safe spaces without alcohol and to see that there is “more than just the party scene” in I.V. said Program Board commissioner Bo Wolfe. He said an event like First Friday is especially important for first-year students who are still finding their footing in the community.</p>\n<p>Although community volunteers have organized the event in the past, several UCSB clubs, including A.S. Program Board, hope to host it in the future. Though each organization approaches First Fridays differently, they all plan art, lights and a substance free area for students to relax and socialize.</p>\n<p>Since the first event in October of 2014 with a turnout of around 70 people, it has grown to feature fire jugglers, a palm reader, food trucks and a snow machine from the UCSB Excursion Club during the holidays.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72994\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1841787309\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72996\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72994\" data-attachment-id=\"72994\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-09/first-friday-offers-free-food-laid-back-vibes/ivff-by-christina-demarzo-10072016-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=1325%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1325,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivff-by-christina-demarzo-10072016-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72994\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=250%2C377\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1159&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IVFF-by-Christina-DeMarzo-10072016-1.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The turnout steadily increased as word spread and student organizations began to sponsor the event, driving attendance up to 500 students per event.</p>\n<p>The idea of First Fridays emerged two years ago, after the May 23, 2014 Isla Vista shooting. Kim Yasuda, a professor in the Department of Art, started a class called I.V. OpenLab to create projects for the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Organized by student volunteers from Yasuda’s class with support from Chancellor Yang, senior campus organizations advisor Viviana Marsano, I.V. Drip, Sorriso Italiano and Shave It, First Fridays were born.</p>\n<p>The events were not only for students, but for families and other residents who came together to strengthen the community. The first event was held in People’s Park, next to the Love and Remembrance Garden, a place described by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District as a “meaningful place for public commemoration and healing.”</p>\n<p>Marsano emphasized the importance of community in bringing the event to fruition.
