And you’ve heard that fracking could be bad. So you did not read all 29 pages of the initiative and you signed because, what harm could it do? Yep, I’ve been there, done that. And while I do believe the people who asked you to sign meant well, the truth is that Measure P is a poorly written initiative that is now on your ballot and will significantly damage the County if voters pass it.</p>\n<p>So what about banning onshore fracking in the County? One company unsuccessfully tried fracking in the County in 2009 and 2010. This led to the rigorous County fracking ordinance that is now in place (as of 2011). Geologists will also tell you the onshore oil deposits in the county are too sandy and are already fissured so fracking won’t work here. So why not ban fracking just to be certain it does not happen in SB County? Because Measure P has a much broader and more damaging scope than just fracking. This initiative asks you to vote to ban all future high-intensity oil operations in the county and shut down current high-intensity operations (projected to occur by 2019). Supporters of P will tell you otherwise, that current operations are unaffected — but just reading the words in the initiative doesn’t tell the whole story. Legal interpretation is required to understand “vested rights,” “takings” and specific legal history relevant to the County and State. Not being an attorney myself, I rely on attorneys to explain legal language. What I found is only one attorney, who co-wrote P, says P won’t cause a shutdown. All other legal opinions disagree, including the neutral County attorney. He has gone on record stating the language of the initiative leaves the County exposed to litigation that the County does not have insurance coverage for, and if he could rewrite the initiative to protect the County, he would. But he doesn’t have that option.</p>\n<p>Reduced or eliminated oil production in the County means 1) less tax revenues that benefit schools and services (e.g., fire), 2) less oil jobs in the County and State and 3) less revenue to businesses who serve the oil community (hotels, restaurants, gas stations). Can SB County afford these losses?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There’s simply too much collateral damage that comes with Measure P.

A crowd of 400,000, four times more than the most generous expected attendance, flooded the streets of Manhattan, celebrating our unity and demanding action. Among those 400,000 were ten UCSB students and five alumni who came together to represent UC Santa Barbara at the march. I was one of them. Our group ranged from a freshman taking her first step in environmental activism to a graduate student and alumnus who are deeply involved with groups like the Environmental Affairs Board and the California Student Sustainability Coalition.</p>\n<p>The march, dubbed the People’s Climate March, was endorsed by more than 1,000 environmental and social justice organizations. It was intended to be a public call for action on climate change from world leaders and planned to coincide with the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Summit that took place in New York City two days later.</p>\n<p>Talking about climate change can be disheartening, especially when we focus on all the effects it seems to already be wreaking on this planet. This march had the opposite effect. For me and everyone I encountered there, this march empowered us and gave us a new sense of hope in the face of this crisis. We chanted, smiled and embraced fellow marchers in a joyful display of unity across the huge diversity of those represented, from workers unions, indigenous groups and religious organizations to student groups like ours. The event took on a more somber tone when at 12:58 p.m., silence filled the air as the crowd linked hands overhead and took a moment to remember those who have suffered or are already suffering at the hands of climate change and the fossil fuel industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At 1:00 p.m. however, a wave of sound rose from one end of the march to the other as participants sounded the alarm on climate change, an alarm scientists have been sounding since at least 1988. It was what Bill McKibben called, “the burglar alarm on those who are trying to steal our future.” The sense of community felt among participants was awe-inspiring. We were all there together to demand action and say that these issues are everyone’s issues.</p>\n<p>“When the march began, I didn’t think it was possible for so many people marching, singing and beating drums, to suddenly fall silent,” said Leah Schulman, one of the Gauchos with me. “But when it came, you could hear a pin drop. The only thing more powerful than that silence was the rush of noise that came after.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the masses that gathered in New York City, 2,646 solidarity events took place the same weekend in 162 countries, including several in California. What is evident from these events is that there is a global movement to fight climate change and that it is the “front-line communities” — indigenous groups, island nations and those already affected by climate change — that are at the forefront of it.</p>\n<p>Climate justice was a leading theme of the march, since it is countries that have contributed the least to climate change who, so far, are seeing its effects the most strongly. It was inspiring to see dozens of people from island nations and communities from the Ecuadorian Amazon lead the march. These people’s homes and ultimately lives are at stake — when disaster strikes they have nowhere else to go and often do not have the resources to adapt to the changing environment. It is critical for us to join in solidarity with those already affected by climate change, even if we have yet to witness the consequences of climate change in our own lives.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the event from which we all drew inspiration was the number of university students represented. Including those of us from UCSB, it is estimated that more than 50,000 university students took part in the event. This is not surprising, for the divestment from fossil fuels campaign that has spread across the nation began with college student activists. It has now grown to such strength that the Rockefellers, who owe their immense wealth to oil, have recently pledged to divest their funds from the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>It was uplifting to engage with students from universities across the country and learn about all of their campaigns, including divestment aimed at fighting the fossil fuel industry and the influence it has over our democracy. It can be easy for individuals to feel disempowered but this march did the opposite. We gained a sense of the magnitude of the fossil fuel divestment movement that is taking place at hundreds of universities across the United States and the enormous strides it has already taken in changing the public’s opinions of the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the march, it is critical to understand what this means for ourselves and for our community here at UCSB. As university students, we enjoy a privileged position in society and must use this to bring light to the struggle of frontline communities in the face of climate change. It is our responsibility to speak out on the environmental injustices that are being wrought against our generation and generations to follow.</p>\n<p>One way of doing this is by demanding that our university divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry. While this alone is not enough to slow climate change, if the entire University of California system were to do so it would send a message to the nation, perhaps the world, that investment in fossil fuels is no longer a viable option for those interested in preserving a livable climate for our own and future generations.</p>\n<p>With 400,000 people at the People’s Climate March, the event has been considered an overwhelming success. However, the true success stems from the empowerment individuals gained through this march to return to their communities and enact change, however small or big that may be. Whether that means composting or becoming active in one of UCSB’s 40 environmental groups, it is up to individuals how involved they want to be in this movement. There is a UC fossil fuel divestment campaign active at UCSB where students are always welcomed and encouraged to get involved in through the Environmental Affairs Board. Students should stay informed about the upcoming mid-term election in Nov. and the “Healthy Air and Water Initiative,” otherwise known as Measure P, which would “effectively ban extreme fossil fuel extraction in Santa Barbara county.”</p>\n<p>The People’s Climate March was an inspiring and empowering demonstration of an active democracy and if you would like to hear more about our experience there, please come to our presentation at the Environmental Affairs Board meeting at 7 p.m. on Oct. 15. We will share personal anecdotes, photos and videos from the People’s Climate March and give more information about how to get involved in the solutions that have been proposed to combat climate change. We hope to see you there.</p>\n<p>Fighting climate change will be a long and arduous task but if our generation does not do it, then who will?</p>\n<p><em>Katie Koerper is a fourth-year Communications &amp; Global Studies major</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Wasn’t my high school diploma enough? Shouldn’t I just get a job and start a family? In our community and many others, this is typically regarded as the path for a Latino male. But I knew my path would be different.  Excitement does not begin to describe how I felt when I was accepted to the University of California, Santa Barbara. I had the chance to live in the dorms, join sports, participate in many extra-curricular activities and study abroad in Paris. In short, I had the best time of my life.</p>\n<p>Now, as an assistant principal in L.A., I spend my days working to ensure that other students who share my background have access to these great life experiences. I first began to realize that education was the place for me during my years at UCSB, when I had the chance to visit a number of local public schools — a few miles down the road but worlds away from our pristine quads and classrooms. Seeing the discrepancies in academic achievement and facilities connected directly to the classes I’d been taking and ignited my interest for social justice. As I learned more, I began to view the classroom as the singular most powerful place to have the kind of impact I imagined.</p>\n<p>By the time I graduated, I had a degree in Sociology and Political Science, a minor in Education, and a focus on Immigration, Critical Race Theory and Education Reform. From there, I began to teach. And it was during my four years in the classroom (then another as principal teacher in residence) that my academic interest in education transformed into a deep, abiding passion. I went on to earn my master’s in Education Policy and Administration from Loyola Marymount University and now serve as assistant principal at PUC Community Charter Middle School in the San Fernando Valley, very close to where I grew up. Every day, I feel blessed to be able to give back to the community that gave me so much.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a first-generation Mexican-American and the first college graduate in my immediate family, I am very proud to be helping others realize what’s possible through education. Most powerful of all, today, my family takes pride in my decision to pursue higher education and by how motivated I’ve become to make a difference in this world.</p>\n<p>Looking at my students, I see so much of myself, from the community and culture we share to the challenges we’ve faced. In my own academic life, I’ve questioned if I had what it took to be successful. Studying never came easy to me and there were so many cultural messages pulling me away from applying myself in school. But I also know what is now possible for me because I did. If my students internalize one thing, I hope it will be this.</p>\n<p>Today, I bring my personal story, along with my identity as first-generation Mexican- American and college graduate, to school with me. As a leader, I bring all these elements and hold the mirror up to my students, staff and families. Every day we are faced with obstacles — some small and direct, others stemming from larger systemic oppressions. I’m proud to stand as a living example for the many families I have come to meet and love over the years that college doesn’t have to be a dream. Together, we can make it a reality.</p>\n<p>In all of this, the role of committed educators cannot be overstated. As Hispanic Heritage month comes to a close, I hope we’ll remember the unique role for classroom and school leadership in the broader fight for equity and opportunity. Every day, my colleagues and I are privileged to help shape the minds and futures of our next generation. As you imagine your own future, I hope you’ll join us.</p>\n<p><i>Claudio Estrada ‘09 is an assistant principal in Los Angeles and 2010 Teach For America alumnus.</i></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion Page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

I care about my impact on the planet and stay educated about the ways that I can be more carbon-conscious. One thing I know for certain is that whenever possible, using locally sourced goods, labor and materials is better for the environment and our local economy.  Unfortunately, the supporters of Measure P have forgotten that. Measure P would require us to shift our reliance from domestically produced oil towards less regulated and more carbon-expensive oil imports from other countries. Santa Barbara County, the birthplace of the modern environmental movement, has some of the world’s most stringent environmental regulations on oil production. This being the case, in my opinion, as long as there exists an overwhelming demand for oil in our country we should be moving towards energy independence by producing it from tightly regulated, domestic sources in order to minimize costs and maximize environmental safety.Measure P supporters have taken tousing scare tactics, talking about the threat of fracking here in Santa Barbara, when the truth is no fracking takes place in Santa Barbara because the geological make-up of the naturally fractured Monterey Formation makes the use of hydraulic-fracturing unnecessary and therefore unprofitable; hence, no fracking permits have even been applied for in Santa Barbara County. Additionally, if Measure P were to pass it would choke off hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity including funding that supports public schools and various other local governmental agencies. Understanding the fact that the environment does not solely exist on a local scale but rather on global scale provides the grounds for realizing that the passing of Measure P is not a solution to curing our oil dependence but rather acts as an exasperator of environmental and economic damage. I’m going to vote No on Measure P.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>Sam Bever</em><em> is a fourth-year</em> <em>economics major.</em></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/environmentalist-and-against-measure-p/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/environmentalist-and-against-measure-p/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/environmentalist-and-against-measure-p/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/environmentalist-and-against-measure-p/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-15/environmentalist-and-against-measure-p/","id":5780,"author":{"id":411,"name":"Sam Bever"},"related":[5779,5778,5777],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
