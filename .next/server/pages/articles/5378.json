They also set one of the longest winning streaks in sports history at 89 games on the Association of Volleyball Professionals tour and international circuit. Walsh Jennings is a two-time AVP MVP and won the FIVB Best Blocker Award four consecutive years, from 2005 to 2008.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You have three consecutive Olympic gold medals.

I knew it was possible. Making it happen is another thing, but Misty and I have had a winning recipe. We knew what it took to get there and every four years we would shake things up and we’d keep growing — and that’s how you keep being successful, is evolving and getting out of your comfort zone, and we really did that.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know some people doubted you and Misty going into London, but you only dropped one set. What obstacles did you have to overcome and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The public perception of us, for sure. I’ve never been an underdog my whole life and that didn’t sit well with me. That being said, in our heads we knew when we got there that we weren’t going to be the underdogs anymore. But we have other things too … life. I have two kids now. Our responsibilities are so much more now than they had in the past. And the game had grown so much in the two years we took off, so just getting reacquainted with each other after a couple years off and getting reacquainted with beach volleyball. There were a lot of really big challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty have been unstoppable. What’s it like playing with her?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s really fun. Her skills made me better and I always wanted to be better because she always carried her weight and I wanted to make sure that I did that. It was a true joy to play with her for so long. We had an amazing ride together — not always pretty, not always effortless … never effortless really, but it was really fun to go to work with her and grow up with her really.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Misty just retired. How much longer do you plan on playing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: My goal is to play in the 2016 Olympics and win a gold medal That’s my dream. I’m going to take a year off — I’m pregnant right now — have this beautiful baby and then I feel I have three years of really good volleyball in me. I just want to keep getting better and I feel I have so much more in me. So, once I find my partner in crime, we’ll go to work and we’ll hone our team and make sure we’re on task.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You and Misty will go down as the best duo in beach volleyball, but maybe also the best in all sports. Have you taken the time to reflect on everything you guys have done?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. I think that that’s something that will come maybe when I retire. I think that I’m just so in it right now and so present. I’m so grateful for what we had together and it’s so crazy to be talking in past tense about her. It was only two months ago that we did this together. I feel like we deserve to be in that conversation, and I hope that doesn’t sound arrogant. I just know that we had something special. Jerry Rice and Joe Montana, Pippen and Jordan — all these amazing duos — we absolutely deserve to be in that conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you played indoor volleyball at Stanford. How did you get into beach volleyball?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Right when I finished college, after the Sydney Olympics, I needed a change. The options were to go to Europe and play or to try beach and Misty May-Treanor, one of the best players in the world, was looking for a partner. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up, so I did a gut check, an ego check. I went through a lot of growing pains in the first year, but I stuck with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I know you have a cousin in Taylor Formico at UCSB. Have you kept up with how she’s doing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s been easy to keep up with her because she’s kicking butt apparently. I’m really proud of her. She’s a fighter and her dad is one of eight kids and he’s probably the most competitive of those eight and it’s really cool to see Taylor take so much after her father, and her mother and [to] see her excel where she’s worked so hard to get where she’s at.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s it like being a professional athlete and mom?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s a dream come true. I’ve always wanted to be a working mom like my mom. I’m passionate about both things. Obviously, my family is number one and to be able to combine it with something that I’m so passionate about in my career and the sport I love is truly a dream come true and I just want to keep the ride going as long as I can be the best me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-25/breathe-battle-kerri-walsh-jennings/","id":5378,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[5377,5376,5375],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Three Gauchos Earn 2012 All-Big West Honors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a season in which the UCSB women’s volleyball team finished 16-17 and 9-9 in the Big West conference, three players received great praise for their play this season.

She finished her freshman campaign by shattering the UCSB and Big West digs record of 652 by recording 792 digs. Formico led the conference with 5.87 digs per set, which also ranked her eighth in the nation. She was not just a force on the court defensively, as she was also the Gauchos’ second leading server with 29 service aces on the year.</p>\n<p>“It’s quite an honor because the Big West coaches are really smart coaches. They know what kind of impact a player makes,” Head Coach Kathy Gregory said. “For her to get Freshman of the Year shows the magnitude of what she did for us.”</p>\n<p>At the outside hitter position, Leah Sully was named as a first team All- Conference player. As the Gauchos’ top scorer, Sully led UCSB with 1,798 total swings and 558 kills, which gave her the highest total in the Big West, and her 4.13 kills per set ranked her third in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Leah was well deserving because if you look at her she was third in hitting, but I think the biggest thing is she’s an all-around player,” Gregory said. “She plays every play; she doesn’t get to take a play off and she elevated her game at the end of the season, which is what I’m most impressed with, that she played even better at the end.”</p>\n<p>Sully led the Gauchos with 33 service aces this season and showed her ability on both offense and defense as she accumulated 495 digs, second on the team behind Formico and ninth in the conference with 3.67 per set.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it’s a huge honor; it is really cool to get this because I was honorable mention last year,” Sully said. “It is always great to improve and be recognized for it. I’ve always wanted to be an All-American so I’ll keep pushing myself and hopefully get that next year.”</p>\n<p>Thompson was named as an honorable mention to the All-Conference team this season as she was the Gauchos’ second leading scorer. Thompson was second on the team with 311 kills and a .224 hitting percentage. She ranked third on the team with 28 service aces, behind only Sully and Formico. Defensively, Thompson was one of the top blockers for Santa Barbara, recording 123 total blocks on the year and 1.06 blocks per set, both good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>“I feel very honored to receive the award, thanks to the help of my other teammates who helped me get this, like Leah and Taylor, who essentially set the bar,” Thompson said. “Hopefully I can build on this and achieve greater next season.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49168\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49168\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-earn-2012-allbig-west-honors/","id":5375,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5374,5373,5372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Break Third Place Tie in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team will have an opportunity to move up in the Big West conference with two home league matches against Fullerton tonight and Riverside Saturday.

Thompson’s replacement raises a more difficult question. Villanueva was the other opposite on the team, so with both down, the Gauchos will mix and match, but freshman outside hitter Alex Barbeau should see more playing time this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Titans, however, are riding high on a four game winning streak. Fullerton leads the Big West with 116 services aces on the year and 1.49 per set. The Gauchos will have to keep focus on junior outside hitter Bre Moreland, who is No. 1 with 35 aces this year. UCSB will also have to keep an eye on senior outside hitter/middle blocker Kayla Neto, the reigning player of the week in the conference and senior setter Gabrielle Dewberry, who rank No. 5 and No. 9 in the conference in aces, respectively.</p>\n<p>“We are a pretty good passing team, so I don’t think that will be an issue for us,” Gregory said. “We don’t give up that many aces … but they are a good serving team though, so we will see.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UC Riverside will look to turn their season around after an abysmal start to league play. The Highlanders are 5-15 on the season, but are 0-7 in conference play with a seven game losing streak. The streak could come to an end before visiting the Gauchos, however, as Riverside will face Cal Poly on Friday, the only other winless team in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We will always remember being ahead of Riverside two games to none last year and then losing in five,” Gregory said. “They do have a fast attack and set the ball exceptionally fast. It’s hard playing a dangerous team that’s suddenly going to play a good game.”</p>\n<p>Riverside’s strength lies in its offense. The Highlanders are second only to Fullerton in aces and also have three servers making the top 10. Freshman setter Emily Borges is third in the league serving, and leads the league in assists with an average of 10.61 per set and a total of 743.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are scheduled to begin play on both Friday and Saturday nights at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/gauchos-break-place-tie-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/gauchos-break-place-tie-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/gauchos-break-place-tie-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/gauchos-break-place-tie-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/gauchos-break-place-tie-big-west/","id":5376,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5375,5374,5373],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep CSUN, Fall to No. 8 Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team split its weekend match-ups, losing 3-0 Saturday night to No. 8 Hawaii after defeating Cal State Northridge 3-0 Friday.

They were down 14-20, but scored 11 of the next 13 points to make a comeback that kick-started a run that would last throughout the second and third set.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a comeback team the whole season; we usually have a slow start and I think we all believed in each other that we could come back and win that game,” junior outside hitter Leah Sully said. “Once things started falling into place, the rest was history.”</p>\n<p>Sully had double digit kills and digs with 16 and 13, respectively, as well as two service aces. In addition, freshman libero Taylor Formico set the record for UCSB for most digs in a season by a freshman with 418. With her 18 on the night, she surpassed Kelly Heenan by four digs. Sophomore setter Ali Santi recorded 16 digs on the night as well and had 36 assists, leading to the Gauchos compiling 47 assists on the night.</p>\n<p>“We never gave up, we never let up and we never got comfortable,” junior outside hitter Kara Sherrard said. “We constantly were motivated, like every point was the last point.”</p>\n<p>Coming up next for the Gauchos is a road trip to UC Davis, Friday, Oct. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-sweep-csun-fall-8-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-sweep-csun-fall-8-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-sweep-csun-fall-8-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-sweep-csun-fall-8-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-sweep-csun-fall-8-hawaii/","id":5377,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5376,5375,5374],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
