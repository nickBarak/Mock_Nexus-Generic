His films always revel in excess, often taking the form of the candy-coated violence of “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.” “Kill Bill,” his most cartoonishly bloody film, had to be split into two releases due to its epic length. His latest work, “The Hateful Eight,” could have benefitted most from a similar sense of restraint.</p>\n<p>Set in post-Civil War America and starring a cast of killers and crooks portrayed by the talented likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern, the film fails to provide a story compelling enough for their enlivened performances to carry it for the three-hour runtime. It meanders through its first act, taking viewers along on a stagecoach ride bogged down by snow and an inconsiderate sense of pacing. As Jackson and Russell’s bounty hunters ride along with Leigh’s captured criminal and Goggins’s radically racist, so-called sheriff, they string along tales of their past deeds to flesh out their characters. Though it’s clear through their long-winded discourse that each of them maintains a suspicious distrust of the others, this sizeable chunk of the film is altogether not interesting enough to conjure up the tension it’s aiming for.</p>\n<p>The same can be said of the rest of the film’s first act, in which these four lodge up with the four other hatefuls to take shelter from an impending blizzard. The plot continues to trudge right up until the intermission, continuing to deal in shifty-eyed deceit and questionable, racially charged banter. The first bloodshed finally signals the ignition of the slow burn the film stokes throughout its first half, but the fire fails to light all that brightly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In its post-intermission devolution into a mess of desperation, death and violence, “The Hateful Eight” fails to find its footing. It channels Tarantino’s earliest work, “Reservoir Dogs,” in its conceit of criminals walled up together in a room killing each other one by one, but never achieves the raw tension of the older work. In “Reservoir Dogs,” tension is derived physically — an organic link formed between their mistrust and paranoia and the precise, powerful violence they inflict upon one another. This tension thus becomes palpable. In “The Hateful Eight,” the drama and violence are disjointed.</p>\n<p>The tension between the eight is based upon the duplicity between the characters. Everyone is lying to each other, and the audience just doesn’t quite know how, or to what ends. However, the film’s intense violence does not come as a result of this deceit but in addition to it, and thus its sophistication as cinematic currency is lost. The film revels in cringe and shock value to dubious effect, becoming an incessant bloodbath (even by Tarantino’s standards) without having earned the right to do so.</p>\n<p>This misestimation of his usual assets seems to stem from Tarantino’s hubris as a filmmaker. As evidenced by the above analyses and the film’s ostentatious runtime, we see an auteur so self-assured of his talent and worth that some editors must have been left underworked. Tarantino has refused to kill a single darling, and his audience is the one paying for it.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker’s big ambitions with “The Hateful Eight” did manage to pay off in one respect: the film’s “roadshow” presentation. Beginning with a five minute overture brandishing the scene-stealing score of legendary composer Ennio Morricone (“The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”) and split with a 12-minute intermission, the theater-going experience really did become an event. It was charming to peek back into the projector box to see the giant rolls of 70mm film, rendering the images on screen with such detail that small facets of wardrobe and setting became intricately involved with the movie in order to lend to its theatrical nature.</p>\n<p><em>“</em>The Hateful Eight” wraps itself in an intriguing presentation that can’t be matched by the presumptuous puttings-on of its plot. Toying with themes of duplicity, honesty and identity that never quite hit home, it allows itself to slip into violent spectacle for the sake of violence and spectacle. Quentin Tarantino’s eighth film, while certainly a cinematic experience, was not his best. Hopefully, the ninth will represent a return to form that does not betray its function.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

from his childhood: seeing “Star Wars: A New Hope” a whole two weeks before any of his friends did. Colbert, who won two tickets to an advanced screening from a radio station in eighth grade, recognized immediately that “Star Wars” had changed everything and lamented the fact that none of his classmates yet understood his love for that galaxy far, far away. Although Colbert has been a “Star Wars” fan a whole two weeks longer than most people, ask any person who was young during the summer of 1977, and I bet they will have a similar story to tell.</p>\n<p>The success of “Star Wars: A New Hope” was truly unexpected and unprecedented: the film was turned down by United Artists, Universal Pictures and Disney, but was finally budgeted a measly $8 million by 20th Century Fox. It opened on a Wednesday in less than 32 theaters nationwide, with even George Lucas forgetting the film’s premiere. The film was an immediate smash hit — theaters quickly began demanding the film, and Fox’s stock price doubled in three weeks. “Star Wars” quickly became the most successful film they had ever released. All this from a film that Lucas so expected to flop that he wrote a self-contained storyline in case he was denied future funding.</p>\n<p>In 2012, after five more “Star Wars” movies and a handful of ill-fated TV specials and animated features, Lucas sold Lucasfilm, along with the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” properties, to Disney for $4.05 billion. With George’s empire now in their hands, Disney quickly announced a new trilogy of films, with “The Force Awakens” taking place roughly 30 years after the events of “Return of the Jedi,” as well as three stand-alone films focused on specific characters. The Internet, of course, went wild.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With less than a month left until “The Force Awakens” premieres in North America Dec. 18, 2015, how much do we actually know about the film? Unsurprisingly, very little, with a lot of room for speculation. Between a handful of teasers, two trailers (one Japanese) and a 60-second spot, we can infer a lot about the film.</p>\n<p>Even 30 years after the death of Emperor Palpatine, the galaxy still finds itself in a struggle for peace, with the Empire replaced by the New Order, led by a new masked darksider, Kylo Ren, a member of the Knights of Ren, a cult devoted to “finishing what [Vader] started.” Fighting against this new reign of tyranny are scavenger Rey; Poe Dameron, a member of the Resistance, which has replaced the Rebel Alliance; and Finn, a First Order deserter who is somehow in possession of Anakin Skywalker’s lightsaber (y’know, the one that Obi-Wan picked up when he left Anakin for dead and then gave to Luke, who lost it when his hand got chopped off in Cloud City. Yeah, that one). Guiding these young heroes along are near-mythical figures Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker (whose face has yet to appear in promotional content).</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to imagine a storyline for this film. Considered together, the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy tell the tale of the fall of a father and his eventual redemption through the help of his son and the triumph of good over tyrannical evil. From the second that he accepts Anakin’s lightsaber from Obi-Wan in “A New Hope,” Luke assumes the responsibility of being his father’s son, and all the good and evil that comes with it. The Rebel Alliance’s toppling of a monolithic, totalitarian and xenophobic imperialist regime was just a secondary benefit of Luke’s quest. And just as Obi-Wan passed the lightsaber on to Luke, just as George Lucas passed the lightsaber on to J.J. Abrams, just as the generation that saw “A New Hope” in theaters passed the lightsaber on to their children, the characters of the original trilogy pass their triumphs and struggles on to a younger generation — a new group of protagonists who are strong as the aging heroes grow weary.</p>\n<p>And that’s what this is all about, isn’t it? The passing of the lightsaber — the changing of the guard. “The Force Awakens” boasts an amazingly long cast of series veterans, many of whom are returning to these characters after more than 30 years away: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Leia Organa), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Warwick Davis (Wicket the Ewok) and Tim Rose (Admiral Ackbar). The project also employs veterans Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the scripts for “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” composer John Williams and sound designer Ben Burtt.</p>\n<p>And so it was with this “Star Wars” “brain trust” that J.J. Abrams embarked on his labor of love. With the help of Simon Pegg, whom Abrams treated as a sounding board, a generation that had grown up absolutely enamored by “Star Wars” was given the chance to play in the galaxy far, far away while working with many of the people who made the place what it is today. Many of Abrams’s choices hearken back to the original trilogy: heavy reliance on practical effects, scale models and actual set pieces in contrast to the prequel trilogy’s extensive reliance on CGI; the use of 35mm Kodak film and 65mm IMAX in contrast to the digital cameras used for “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith;” and the return of iconic ships such as T.I.E. Fighters, X-Wings, Star Destroyers, a massive spherical superweapon and, most importantly, the Millennium Falcon.</p>\n<p>“The Force Awakens” is a second coming of “Star Wars” in a world that was let down by the prequel trilogy. It is made to recapture the childhood that a generation experienced in the summer of 1977. There is absolutely no way that it will not succeed in terms of sales; the real challenge is changing the game and inspiring a new generation, like “A New Hope” did all those years ago. According to Disney, the film’s second teaser trailer, released April 16, 2015, was viewed more than 88 million times within its first 24 hours online. IMAX ticket sales quickly reached over $6.5 million for just the U.S./Canada market, shattering records set by films like “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Avengers,” which had garnered around $1 million each. Ticket sales site Fandango crashed repeatedly while “The Force Awakens” sold more than eight times the number of tickets of the previous record-holder, “The Hunger Games.” Analyst Phil Contrino has predicted that “Star Wars” will easily earn $1 billion and could cross into the next billion. (For reference, “Jurassic World” grossed $1.669 billion worldwide and current record-holder “Avatar” grossed $2.788 billion.) Not bad for a group of scruffy-looking nerf herders.</p>\n<p>Here are my thoughts to those who of you who are planning on seeing it — and let’s face it, even if you don’t think you’ll see it, you probably will, and if for some reason you are adamant about not seeing it, it’s probably going to be all you hear about until February — re-watch all six films. That’s right, six. Take in the entire story of the Skywalker family, both the good and the bad, because we may soon be moving on to a new lineage of heroes. Plan on staying off the Internet and social media starting Dec. 14. And if by some weird, freaky, miraculous circumstance you have a friend that has not seen a “Star Wars” film, do not by any means let them watch any before they see “The Force Awakens.” Drag your friend through their protestations — through their kicking and screaming — to see “The Force Awakens” with you. If it somehow ends up being bad, then your friend might be angry at you for a bit. But if it turns out to be anything close to what “A New Hope” was, then your friend will forever remember you as the person who showed them an amazing film that changed their life. You will have passed on the lightsaber and shown them what it’s like to live a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away …</p>\n<p>And the Force will be with you.

And I doubt very many people will want to go see a rated-G film in lieu of “Spectre,” which will probably go on to earn a billion dollars like its predecessor. However, if I were to choose between seeing James Bond inevitably kick some ass or see “The Peanuts Movie” again, I’d go for the latter option in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>That’s because “Peanuts,” written by the son and grandson of mastermind Charles Schulz, is flipping <em>adorable. </em>It’s hard not to fall in love with resurrected world of Charlie Brown and company. In addition to getting the tone of the world just right, “Peanuts” mixes nostalgia and new elements in fun ways. The art design is the same, but in CGI. It holds up 95% of the time, apart from a moment when two children talked and their mouths hardly moved. Purists need not panic, there are a few 2D sequences thrown in to spice things up. The classic “Linus and Lucy” comes back for a fitting encore, accompanied by “I’m Better When I’m Dancin’,” a fun little beat by Meghan Trainor. Snoopy even catches a break with his arch nemesis! Some will probably disapprove of these changes in formula. I have to admit, hearing the aforementioned songs side-by-side is a little jarring. It’s like listening to “Love Me Do” then “Radioactive.” If you can get over the feeling of anachrony then you’ll probably fall head over heels for this revival’s irresistible charm.</p>\n<p>“Peanuts” follows the honorable Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) in his quest to impress the Little Red-Haired Girl, who has just moved into town. As his attempts humorously blow up in his face again and again, Snoopy (voiced from beyond the grave by Bill Melendez via archive recordings) finds inspiration from his owner’s repeated failings. He writes a new, romantic tale of him fighting the Red Baron, providing welcome breaks in between the main story, as well as changing the scenery from “Peanuts” to something more along the lines of “Planes: Fire and Rescue” because there are planes, and forests … I need to watch more movies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While watching Snoopy and Woodstock fight the good fight against the forces of imagined evils is fun enough, all emotional investment rests with Chuck. I’m sure a lot of us can relate to the unease he feels with approaching and impressing his crush; we want to see him get the girl. But at the same time, when he is presented with choices that would hurt others as a result of that pursuit, we want to see him do the right thing as well and the film knows it. Scenes like Charlie giving up his slot at the talent show to help his little sister to be her bull for her rodeo routine hit home … grah! This film is too dang cute!</p>\n<p>Now, I think it’s worth noting that, adhering to “Peanuts” tradition, the entire cast (barring animals) is voiced by children. This is a rarity as usually in animation, adult voice actresses voice children, both male and female. Not so here, which really helps drive home the feeling that you’re watching “real” kids. A good thing too, considering much of the humor involves watching Charlie Brown’s classmates say and do things that seem both childlike and adult, from Lucy romantically pursuing the indignant Schroeder to Sally Brown capitalizing on her brother’s newfound fame by giving tours of their house to her interested friends.</p>\n<p>However, as the film went on I started to get the sense that the movie’s humor was not intended for modern day children, because a lot of the jokes were smart and considerably mature. While talkative tots I saw the movie with laughed at the fart gag in the trailer for the new “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” they were completely silent when Charlie Brown went on a snipe hunt for ‘Leo’s Toy Store’ by ‘Warren Piece.’ Add that with lines like, “What if I’m not ready for a serious relationship? I can’t afford a mortgage!” and “Your analysis of this literary classic is beyond reproach,” the children on-screen may as well have been speaking to their real-life counterparts in Latin. At least they cooed when Charlie blushed in the presence of the Little Red-Haired Girl, so I cannot say they were totally uninvested.</p>\n<p>As I conclude what I think actually may be my longest review yet, I want to say that “Peanuts” may not appeal to everyone. If you didn’t grow up with the Great Pumpkin or never had popcorn for Thanksgiving, chances are you’ll feel better watching “Spectre,” and that’s fine. But if you’re willing to indulge your nostalgia or let your inner child out for a day, go see “The Peanuts Movie.” Where else outside of a bad acid trip will you see a dog flying his house like a plane?</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is a big ol’ softie at heart.

Theater on Monday night as Magic Lantern Films celebrated their 50th year of cinematic appreciation. Crowds in and around the theater buzzed with anticipation, and ushers at the front door urged anyone walking by to come take part in the joyful atmosphere.</p>\n<p>For five decades, the Magic Lantern program has brought movies new and old, known and unknown to I.V. Theater, giving students a place to watch their favorite films or to discover something completely new. Students have flocked to the theater on Monday and Friday nights to see cult classics, vintage dramas, indie releases and even new critically acclaimed films. To honor their 50th anniversary, Magic Lantern Films screened a film as famous and analyzed as its main character: “Citizen Kane.”</p>\n<p>Even in the days before the event, students and professors discussed the upcoming screening with eager curiosity. Throughout the various conversations, there was one phrase that came up whenever the film was mentioned, as people declared the film “the best film ever made.” “Citizen Kane’s” reputation as the most expertly crafted film to date isn’t new. The 1941 classic has been praised by critics and movie-lovers alike for its superiority. So what is it about “Citizen Kane” that makes it the perfect choice for Magic Lantern’s 50th anniversary commemoration?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film focuses on the life of Charles Kane, a rich and famous newspaper owner. At the film’s beginning, Kane has just died, and a group of reporters seek to create the most fascinating newsreel possible about the man. Their goal is to discover the meaning behind the tycoon’s enigmatic last word, “Rosebud.” Kane’s story is told through the flashbacks of various characters as his rise and fall from success is analyzed by everyone.</p>\n<p>From the film’s opening, it’s apparent that director Orson Welles, focuses on contrast in both pacing and scenery. The first scene is shadowy and mysterious. Lightning flashes, the imposing gates of Kane’s mansion loom ominously in the foreground and the camera cuts to a close-up of Kane’s mouth just as he utters his last word.</p>\n<p>After Kane dies, the scene cuts to a fast-paced newsreel with fully lit clips of the grand estate, headlines of Kane’s death flashing across the screen and a lively reporter narrating the businessman’s various accomplishments and failures. The stark difference between the two opening scenes provides a contrast between Kane’s personal life and his glorified memorial. Kane’s dark death scene demonstrates the internal troubles that plagued him, while the bright and unemotional newsreel right after represents the public view of Kane, with all his wealth and scandal on display.</p>\n<p>Another area of contrast is in the character of Kane himself, played by Orson Welles. Welles captures the happiness and sadness in Kane’s life with joyful, quick movements one minute and depressed sulking the next. As a young man, he stands tall and commands attention with a booming voice and wide smile. He turns his body quickly to look at everyone while giving an enthusiastic speech and dances with humorous glee after a big success.</p>\n<p>As the public icon grows older and more world-weary, his smile becomes a discomforted scowl and his voice lowers to terse gruffness. He shuffles slowly when he walks and wears a constant look of disappointment. This dramatic change in character reflects the changes that plague Kane’s life and led to his eventual failure.</p>\n<p>The camera work expertly focuses the audience’s attention and helps to demonstrate Kane’s struggle visually throughout the film. In scenes where a reporter is visiting various people for interviews, the reporter faces away from the camera or has his face obscured. This places the audience in the perspective of the reporter as though they are also a part of the action; on a mission to discover Kane’s secret.</p>\n<p>One of the last scenes elegantly illustrates Kane’s life and his true self as the camera pans over a sea of Kane’s possessions, representing all of his deeds, memories and wealth. The camera eventually zooms to focus on a single, nondescript item out of the entire collection, the item that was most important to Kane all along. Here, the camera work shows Kane’s personal value perfectly, proving that in the end, sometimes the simplest things are all that matter.</p>\n<p>“Citizen Kane” is not only a fascinating character study, but also a film that demonstrates the skill it takes to imbed every aspect with meaning and symbolism. From the shadowy lighting that creates an air of mystery, to the camera work that contrasts broad sets with intimate close ups to the acting that shows happiness deteriorating as life goes on, the film is engaging and eloquent, with the theme of memory present in every character and every scene. It’s not only for the film’s fame, but also for this theme of memory that made the film a natural choice for Magic Lantern’s 50th anniversary. What better way to celebrate the memory of cinema than with a film that proves just how important memories can be?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/magic-lantern-celebrates-50th-anniversary-with-citizen-kane/","id":5893,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[5892,5891,5890],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
