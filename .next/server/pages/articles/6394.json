Like a dark, ominous cloud — holding not refreshing showers, but a disturbing concoction of flat keg beer and alumni semen — it hovered over I.V., raining down upon us with the reminder of old flames we thought we’d never have to see (sleep with) again.</p>\n<p>But to be fair, there is something inordinately thrilling about having one last (until next year) go-around with someone who can’t stop repeating the phrase “Only in I.V.” as you physically recount your relationship one thrust at a time.</p>\n<p>There is something even more thrilling about being that little gem of nostalgia your alum will keep close to heart on dark nights, when they’re filing their tax return, musing on how badly I.V. screwed them up for the real world of dating. (Who knew that a bro tank with “DTF Sluts” on it wouldn’t work as a stand-alone pick-up line?)</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the discomfort I felt watching a middle-aged man at the Study Hall slosh shamelessly from bar stool to bar stool, waiting for one morally questionable undergrad with daddy issues to jump on his promises of financial stability, this weekend did instill a sweet, misguided pride in me for the alumni that UCSB produces.</p>\n<p>Sure, once the tassle has been turned, we’re left with thousands of aimless faces looking around at each other like, “Shit, are you the only ones who will understand me out there?” Yes, we probably are. But the uniqueness of our explicit ventures here in this little town of wonderful misfits is that they prepare a wildness in us that will be fondly (and desperately) held onto — like that last saliva-diluted plastic handle at the party — for as long as our livers permit us to keep on keepin’ on.</p>\n<p>I.V. is a magical place. Yeah, I said it. And I’ll continue to say it till my UCSB sweatshirt has moth holes in it and “Loopy” better describes my mental state than my absurd, vodka-laden, bar-hopping Saturday afternoon with a bunch of lovable disasters I’m proud to call my best friends.</p>\n<p>This weekend reminded me of the damn awesome-as-shit spirit of you people — both beneath the sheets and, you know, in life. There’s something remarkable about seeing that guy who used to end up with a mop duct-taped to his torso every weekend return with a vengeance after three years out of college. And that old flame? Hell yeah, I hope you hit yours too, because there are few things so excellent as the realization of “Damn, that was worth all the emotional trauma it resulted in a couple years ago.”</p>\n<p>So, to the middle-aged troll at the Study Hall, to the alum I’ll never forget (at least until I get around to washing my bedsheets), to all of us who are still here, waking up Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning, questioning our character while we scour last night’s clothing for any telling stains: I salute you. And I will be the first to buy you a drink next year.</p>\n<p>Jana Barrett is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s May 2. Writing that fills me with a degree of nausea I’ve never before known in my life. I’ll find a job I love and keep in touch with the important people; that doesn’t worry me. I’m much more worried about my social habits. Isla Vista is a unique and magnificent place — but how well will that translate into the work world?</p>\n<p>I have a very distinct vision of how my work parties will unfold. My nightmare transpires like this: I’ve found a job I love and am slowly but surely proving to my colleagues that I’m cool, mostly with marginally offensive penis jokes. Thursday night rolls around and a co-workers innocently and fatally invites me to a happy hour gathering. I prepare to take it easy this first time, reminding myself that I’m actually much more fun to be around when my eyes aren’t crossed and I’m not slurring offensive “would you rather”s about railing your own father. We arrive at the bar, I order a beer, one thing leads to the next and BAM, I’m taking body shots off my boss. God forbid I’m ever in a professional setting with a wine bag … do adults drink Franzia?</p>\n<p>As Gauchos, we’ve spent four years perfecting a very specific skill set: making obliteration sexy. Perfecting may be a generous term, but we didn’t get into UCLA, and perfection is relative. Unfortunately, LinkedIn has yet to recognize blacked-out blowies as a legitimate professional attribute, so I guess we’ll just have to adjust. This isn’t anything to get discouraged about — instead, let’s view it as a challenge. There will come a day when you have to feel a bit guilty about boning down in a grimy bathroom, but why dwell on the future?</p>\n<p>Freshmen: You spent the last two quarters regressing from Smirnoff to Heritage, while struggling to balance three bullshit classes per quarter. Don’t worry if you haven’t figured out how to incorporate sloshed sex yet — that’s what sophomore year is for.</p>\n<p>Sophomores: If you’re on track, slutty is no longer a label but a lifestyle. Well done.</p>\n<p>Juniors: At some point this past year, you felt directionless. You entered into a losing philosophical debate with yourself about the purpose of drinking so much and struggled to see your self-worth. Well snap out of it; you’re a Gaucho, goddammit.</p>\n<p>Seniors: You’ve come to terms with the fact that you no longer deserve your parents’ love and are panicking imagining a world of courtship and consequences. To you I suggest going out with a bang — bone down in the library, Bill’s bus, OTT’s bathroom and your roommate’s bed ASAP. There’s something to be said for packing it in at the end. You know, taking some for the road.</p>\n<p>In reality, we’re going to take a lot away with us from UCSB — a degree, a wealth of knowledge and an outlook on seizing the moment that dangerously flirts with alcoholism. I talk big about conforming to professional standards, but let’s be real: It’s going to take years to undo our undergrad damage. And if that’s going to make me a ho in the workplace, then so be it.</p>\n<p>Jenna Ryan is the Daily Nexus Opinion Co-Editor.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1332400935\" data-slb-group=\"46564\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46565\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-01/respect-elders-legacy-alive-beneath-sheets/screen-shot-2012-05-01-at-9-38-59-pm-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=1219%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1219,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?fit=888%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-46565\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 9.38.59 PM (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1-250x142.png?resize=250%2C142\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"142\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?resize=1024%2C583&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-9.38.59-PM-1.png?w=1219&amp;ssl=1 1219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I’m not sure if I read that from a Snapple fact or if I just made that up. But anyway, I didn’t believe it at first, until I started listening to half the shit I say. And turns out, it’s probably right. And I’m likely above average.</p>\n<p>Sometimes lying is fun, but almost always, lying makes you seem a hell of a lot cooler than you really are. Well, that is, until you get caught.</p>\n<p>1. The Athlete: Everyone loves an athlete. It’s a completely forgivable category. You can be a douchebag, closet weirdo or have the IQ of a donkey, but as long as you have the jersey, you’re a fuckin’ stud. But even if you have the makeup of an athlete (chiseled bod, that stupid ass arrogance for no reason at all and excessive grab-ass behavior — regardless of gender), you’ve got nothin’ if you peaked in high school. So while you’re talkin’ to Miss Dick-Sucking-Lips on the couch, you might have to throw a curveball. “Yeah, I’m on the basketball team, it’s really no big deal.” And as she scoots close enough to you to potentially perform a ballcuzi, you choke. “I mean, I’m on the I.M. team, but it’s cool.

The Virgin: Although it’s hard to believe that a) this rare breed exists in Isla Vista and b) they’d be willing to give it up the same night that they met you, you can’t beat this one if you play it off right. Disclaimer: If you don’t, you’ll end up beating it yourself. Meeting a virgin is like entering into the apocalypse. No matter how much you think you’re prepared, you’re still fucked. Wading through the excitement and ego boost, you all of a sudden land on the holy shit freak out that this person is about to remember you forever. But, then, of course, once you’re actually in bed, they start bending like a yoga teacher, hanging upside down from their sex swing, throwing out moves you’ve only seen on T.V. programs. And I’m talkin’ the expensive ones.</p>\n<p>3. The Writer: This one has so many different angles to work with. If you’re a guy, you look sentimental and smart, and if you’re a girl, well, likely you’re smart enough to steal my thunder and play off that you’re Elizabeth Brooks. Clothes come off, and if you’re real wild, sheets may come off too, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “Fuck. What did I just get myself into here? Did I just inadvertently sign up for a Dirty Sanchez? I should’ve done my research on my fake job. Shit.” Well, word to the wise, be prepared for my new favorite question, “Oh my God, are you going to write about this?” Why, yes. Yes I am. It’s on like Groupon.</p>\n<p>4. The Slayer: There’s a fine line between creepy and crafty. Make enough sexual innuendos: crafty. Walk into Jack in the Box in the nude and throw open your robe: creepy. But sometimes, if your little innuendos come off too strong, you might as well start investing in a cheap cotton robe. Talking a big game is lying’s sneaky, twatty sister that no one invited. If you have no intention of following through, you’re just a classic cock-tease, or, you’re in too deep. While you’re jammin’ at a party to “Club Can’t Handle Me” (because enough time has passed for it to be okay to get excited about this song again), you might want to hold back on the, “Yeah, well, if the club can’t handle you, I bet your bottom fuckin’ dollar my hotel room can,” unless you have Gold Cab’s number on speed dial. It comes down to two choices: run, or rail and bail. If you’re gonna lie, you gotta commit.</p>\n<p>5. The Magician: This is one you don’t see very often, unless you’re into David Blaine — or some magical panty dropper effect that I’m unaware of — but mostly just David Blaine. And while it seems far-fetched, and probably some level of just plain uncool to pretend to be a magician, think about what it would be like to encounter one. You’d start out like, “Yeah, sweet, other than pulling a Houdini and blowing a load in a girl’s face, what other little ‘magic’ do you have?” But what if they were a real magician? You might find out what the fuck actually happens when they saw someone in half. Think of all of the secrets you would finally have answers to! Maybe you could join in on one of the acts, hit the road and end up in Vegas. Oh, the possibilities. Just make sure you at least have the abraca-chicken one down before you go big.</p>\n<p>Deceiving someone to get them into bed is just plain cruel. But “I love you,” “I’ll pull out” or “I’m on the pill” are all a little too overused to be taken seriously. So get creative. It may be bad, but hey, it’s fun to do bad things.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/","id":6391,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6390,6389,6388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Roommate Double-Double: Careful Where That Appetite Takes You","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Logic is the devil of language.

Because it would make perfect sense for you to fall in love with your hookup’s roommate. Talk about a classic mix-up.</p>\n<p>Have you ever woken up after a night of (self-proclaimed) “slay city” and looked across the room only to find the most beautiful Lamb of God imaginable lying in the other bed? I know what you’re thinking in that situation, and I’m right there with ya. Yeah, shit son, you went for the wrong roommate. Now? Welcome to the hardest phase of time management you’ll face in your entire college career: swiftly making the transition from roommate number one to roommate number two.</p>\n<p>Upon first meeting each other, you and roommate number two overlook the, “Duhhhhhh, what’s your major?” bullshit, because you very clearly can’t have each other. Cordial schmordial. But, regardless, there’s instant attraction, and before you know it, outta nowhere, it turns into need it, want it, gotta have it. The attraction is mutual, because hello, it makes perfect sense. It’s like solving a Rubik’s Cube — shit finally lines up and then you suddenly can’t suppress the desire to completely fuck it up again. But anywho, I digress.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The worst part is when you actually succeed in hooking up with roommate number two. Because, inevitably, you’ll get caught. It’s always this drawn-out, painfully elaborate process that starts out innocently with roommate number one coming over to your house and asking where you bought these “specialty” condoms. Your casual reply of “Pshh, I bought them” is the last nail in the coffin. Turns out they’re these super fuckin’ rare, can-only-get-them-in-China, heavy-duty, keep-the-babies-AWAY condoms. To which you try to immediately recover with, “Uh, ya. Haha. Ha. Funny story, true story, actually, they started selling them at I.V. Market, who knew right? WHO KNEW?”</p>\n<p>But I mean, once things start moving past the classic OTPHJ (over the pants hand job) stage, it starts becoming, “Listen, my roommate is in class, get your ass over here, NOW.” And then you’re free to bang, and not just bang, puhlease. Forget hearing your standard cup caking through the wall. Ha, child’s play. We’re talking hearing-long-distance-headboard-banging-against-the-wall status. Heyo, ‘sup world.</p>\n<p>You think you’re so suave in keeping it on the major down low. But then shit starts getting all kinds of uncomfortable. In front of roommate number one, you casually mention to roommate number two that they should “draw you,” and it’s like, “Oh, God, not actually. I meant the app!” But even Draw Something wants you to be together. Every three coin word is soulmate … or marriage … or skeeball … okay that was a wild card, but all you want is that goddamn neon color package, so you have to pick them. God. Life is hard.</p>\n<p>And then, despite all this, roommate number one is still way too confident in the hookup relationship, because they somehow remain incredibly oblivious, when everyone at UCSB (including Chancellor Yang) has caught onto what is going on. So number one starts shit-talking to number two. “Hey, bro, I’m wearing Velcro shoes and still getting laid while you go home and beat it tonight.” And all the while, roomie number two is thinking, “Uh, yeah, to the nudes your girlfriend sent me last night. Yeah, yeah, later bro.”</p>\n<p>Then, when all three of you are in public together, the two of you secret lovahs get close enough to start passionately making out, but end up high-fiving instead. ‘Cause as much as you want to finally expose the relationship, it’s like, what are you supposed to say at this point? “I accidentally slipped it in?” Yeah, and I “accidentally” parked my car in my neighbor’s garage … claaaassic me.</p>\n<p>But the real turning point is when they start to make you think all kinds of crazy shit. Like, woah, I would even watch American Idol for this person. Holy shit, I might even go so far as to pick a favorite and start arguing with the judges. No. No way, this is not real life.</p>\n<p>Once that happens, you’re done for. You’ve committed and that only means that roommate number one is bound to walk into your classic afternoon delight sesh.

I come before you today to offer a study that will revolutionize science. Its elegance, infallibility, and pure genius will force the Nobel committee to establish an entirely new field for prizes – one for awesome – and I will be its first ever winner. I give you…the nail test.</p>\n<p>In seventh grade, I was asked to examine my fingernails. Upon turning my palm to face me and curling my fingers down, I was pronounced a heterosexual male. Of course, five years later I would disprove this famed research when wrestling with a friend degraded (actually, upgraded) into possibly the hottest situation I’ve ever found myself in, but while I was an aberration, no one can deny the complete and irreconcilable differences the nail test has demonstrated – neigh proven! – between men and women. So let us examine this idea called gender further.</p>\n<p>Since becoming licensed as a homosexual, I have found that a large sect of my people – a sect I shall arbitrarily call the Closets – are utterly obsessed with their appearance. They are thoroughly concerned with a certain image – one that makes the terms ‘bro,’ ‘man,’ and ‘dude,’ the most important words in the lexicon – and I imagine they must be in their bathroom for hours tailoring to his appearance. It is amusing how staunchly they stick to this personality, for even when we’re alone together, and they are fully aware I know of their attraction to men, they maintain their image. A second sect – I shall, once again very arbitrarily, call this one the Flames – has always astounded me with their stoicism and cavalier bravery in the face of a culture that subconsciously rejects them. They are warriors for their freedom to wear feather boas and rainbow jeans.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And so, the appearance-obsessed Closets and the independent Flames provide an interesting comparison. From my brief description, you have hopefully noticed the clear winners in masculinity are the Closets. This is confirmed by their use of the word ‘man’ in place of any other pronoun. Yet something seems wrong about this conclusion. Perhaps the nail study is wrong, and trying to assign genders to sexes is just plain idiotic.</p>\n<p>I mean, I’m gay, so I should be like a chick? One of the feminine qualities is a lack of stoicism. So I want to challenge every straight dude in my audience to do the following: step on a nail, take a scalpel, cut the nail (inch deep) out of your foot, and use super glue as stitches (please don’t actually do this). I did it, and I’m gay, so every straight man shouldn’t even flinch during the procedure. So the fact I have sex with men does not preclude my ability to ‘take it like a man’ (my dirty mind really just had fun with that phrase). And then there’s my friend, who could, put simply, beat your ass to pulp. This is good, because you’ll want her to when she starts talking about the new shoes bought. And if you want to be utterly owned in logic and analysis, call up my buddy Anne – she’ll hand your manly ass to you on a platter. And what’s with all of those super rational men sticking by their psycho girlfriends; stop crying, just break up with the bitch because she’s really not worth it.</p>\n<p>I would hope my proposals don’t consciously shock you. If they do then I’m really sorry you exist. But the gender roles aren’t supposed to be conscious. They are a cultural undertow of thought. Look outside on a Saturday night and watch boys beat their chests and girls act (key word there) weak and needy to lure in mates. The breeding rituals of Isla Vista (not, mind you, the breeding rituals of <em>Homo Sapiens</em>) necessitate gendered behavior. We <em>accept</em> gender aberrant behavior but still view it as aberrant. This is an incorrect view, and if you think you can argue it is correct, I will happily engage you in lively debate.</p>\n<p>So to the next guy I bring home, don’t bother with the overwhelming urge to assert your masculinity. I tend to be attracted to ambition, individuality, and stoicism – my friend once pointed out all the women I’d go straight for were also capable of murdering me. If I’ve decided to be with you, I know you’re a ‘masculine’ guy. Hell, you’re man enough to admit you want to be with me despite what society says.</p>\n<p>And to all, gay or straight, I want to you this. Consider the traits you find sexually appealing, and then critically examine whether you seek the trait because you like the trait, or because it subconsciously comforts your conditioned need for the gender binary. Overturning this concept of masculine/feminine traits might allow the Closets to dissociate being gay with being actualized as a man, and accept themselves. And that’s good for all of us (mostly me), because Closets are typically very energetic in bed.</p>\n<p>But, go ahead and look at your nails. I still want that damn prize.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-11/dont-base-desires-gender-binary/","id":6393,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6392,6391,6390],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
