After a leadoff walk, freshman second baseman Trent Chatterton faked a bunt and pulled back for a swing to hit a single. After a sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, a ground ball to shortstop by junior centerfielder Brian Carroll scored the first run of the game. Carroll’s RBI was followed by an RBI double by sophomore third baseman Kevin Kramer.</p>\n<p>In the top of the fifth inning, UCLA went back to the same formula to manufacture two more runs. The Gauchos responded with two runs of their own in the bottom of the fifth inning. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward led the inning off by reaching base after being hit by a pitch. He advanced to second on a ground ball and scored on a single by sophomore left fielder Luke Swenson. Swenson advanced to second on a groundout and scored when junior catcher Jackson Morrow grounded a 0-2 pitch to the second baseman Chatterton, who let the ball get through his legs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the sixth, the Bruins ran away with the game, scoring seven runs on four hits and an error by Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kenny Chapman replaced Mahle and quickly loaded the bases without recording an out. Freshman Domenic Mazza then came out of the bullpen to pick up for Chapman. Mazza fielded a grounder and recorded the out by going to the plate with the ball, but Morrow was unable to turn two after the runner’s slide disrupted his throw.</p>\n<p>Moore then doubled down the right field line driving in two runs. Head Coach Andrew Checketts again went to his bullpen, bringing on freshman Connor Baits. Baits was touched up by Chatterton with an RBI single and a two-run double off the bat of Filia. After a walk and hit batter, a sac fly to center field turned into two runs when the throw got away from Morrow and Baits.</p>\n<p>“Mahle gave us a competitive start, but the guys after that did not give us a chance,” Checketts said. “We are going to have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what was going on, but frankly it was embarrassing the way the young guys responded.”</p>\n<p>Both teams would go on to score another run apiece leading to the final score of 12-3 after several players replaced the starters by the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is another home weekend series against San Jose State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo by Mark Brocher / Daily Nexus</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/","id":4503,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4502,4501,4500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Approval of Measure E in November will bring the CSD into existence and approval of Measure F will implement a utility user tax, allowing the CSD to improve infrastructure and institute community policing among other functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As outlined in AB 3, the CSD is to be governed by seven directors, five of whom are elected by Isla Vista voters. Four elected members are to serve four-year terms and one elected member serves for two years. For the inaugural election, however, two of the four-year seats will be two-year seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges intended to seek the Democratic endorsement early in the race. They already share the common endorsement of the Yes on E &amp; F campaign organizers Jonathan Abboud, Cameron Schunk, Darcel Elliot and Assemblymember Das Williams, who first introduced AB 3 in December 2014.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Lebell, a member of the SB Democrats’ central committee, said Wednesday it would be “no surprise” for the party to endorse the four residents. The local party has “good relations” with Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges and the Yes on E &amp; F organizers, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only other CSD candidate to seek the Democrats’ endorsement was Andrew Gabriel Pragin, whose intent was to gain the party’s backing in the competitive race for two temporary two-year positions. He is vying for a seat along with Jordan, Hedges and Michael Kile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out. They have huge resources to draw from,” Pragin said. Gaining the Democratic endorsement, he said, is also key to receiving future endorsements from “influential” organizations like the Sierra Club and the Santa Barbara Women’s Political Committee.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out.”</p>\n<p>— Andrew Gabriel Pragin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pragin and three of the four other “running mate” candidates met with local party officials Thursday at Pea Soup Andersen’s to undergo 15-minute interviews, which the party requires of candidates seeking endorsement. Jordan is currently out of town on a trip to Israel, and Elliott acted as her proxy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the meeting, Pragin said he wanted the party officials to select him for his experience and “perspective” as a local volunteer, potentially selecting him over Jordan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I honestly want them to just look at my credentials, hear what I have to say and realize that they are under no obligation to accept the top-down Das Williams endorsement as their own,” Pragin said Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not receive the endorsement, however, and will now begin what he called the “uphill fight” to seek further endorsements. Daraka Larimore-Hall, the chair of SB Democrats, said the party’s priority was to endorse candidates who “believe in Isla Vista self-governance” and will ensure the success of the CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates Jay Freeman and Kile opted not to seek the Democratic endorsement.

After leading 1-0 through five innings, the Dons put up a single run in the sixth to tie the score and then scored a run in the eighth to take the lead, which would be enough for the win.</p>\n<p>Losing late leads has become a trend recently for SJSU. In two games against Arizona, the Spartans held late leads but fell after some shaky relief pitching. They had a three-run lead into the seventh inning Sunday before a five-run inning followed by a four-run inning in the eighth all but put them away. On Friday they again held a lead, this time all the way to the bottom of the ninth, but a two out error led to a three run triple to cap the win for Arizona.</p>\n<p>“[San Jose] has played some tough people and have played on the road,” Checketts said. “Arizona is a tough place to go out and win and they had a lead in two of those games before they lost them late, so they will be competitive and have a chip on their shoulder.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have seen their fair share of pitching woes this early season as well. On Tuesday afternoon, a combination of three relief pitchers in the sixth inning gave up seven runs allowing UCLA to run away with the game.</p>\n<p>“There have been some freshmen that have been a little out of character,” Checketts said. “Our freshmen came in and struggled quite a bit. There were some growing pains. We would like them to grow a little faster and get through that, but I think they will bounce back and learn from it and be more prepared and tougher because of it.”</p>\n<p>One constant this year, however, has been solid starting pitching from sophomore Austin Pettibone. Friday afternoon’s scheduled starter heads into the weekend with a 1-0 record and a 0.67 earned run average in his two starts. Fellow starter sophomore Andrew Vasquez has struck out 11 through his nine innings of work and holds opponents to a .156 batting average against.</p>\n<p>At the plate, the Gauchos are led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who just had his seven-game hitting streak ended Tuesday. Kuresa, along with junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon, sophomore outfielder Luke Swenson and sophomore third baseman Peter Maris lead the team with six RBI each. The timely hitting by each player has helped to stabilize a lineup that is without its everyday third baseman in Venning.</p>\n<p>The weekend series begins today at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/","id":4501,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4500,4499,4498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes on USC in Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a disappointing 0-3 performance against Cal Poly on the road this past weekend, the UCSB baseball team returns home for a non-conference, solo-game series against USC.
