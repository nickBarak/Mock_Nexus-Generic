The Gales improve to 5-2 on the year and defeat the Gauchos at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>The starter on the bump for UCSB was right-hander junior Chris Clements who pitched pretty decently overall by going five and one-third innings only giving up three earned runs, nine hits while striking out seven batters.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before coming into Tuesday’s matchup, the Gaels left-handed starting pitcher sophomore Ty Madrigal had an earned run average of 7.36 in just two appearances.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Madrigal reversed the script by pitching an absolutely great game as he only allowed two hits, no runs and managed to strike out seven. The lefty pitcher would prove too much for the Gaucho, which is predominantly left.</p>\n<p>The Elk Grove, Calif., native was dominant Tuesday using his two-seam fastball that would cut in on the hands of lefties. On top of this, Madrigal would use his masterful control of his slider, curveball, and changeup to carve up the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Gaucho hitters would fly out nine times of the 11 total they had for the game when Madrigal was on the mound. This was very uncharacteristic of a Gaucho team that came off an offensive barrage in a sweep of the Tulane Green Wave.</p>\n<p>The only bright spot of the afternoon offensively for the Gauchos was junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush would smoke a low line drive homerun over the right field fence against lefty reliever freshman Ken Waldichuk in the bottom of the ninth. Bush would have two of the three total hits for the Gauchos and finished the evening 2-4 with the lone RBI.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the diamond, Saint Mary’s offense proved to be impressive by collecting 10 hits off the Gaucho pitching staff. Leading the way was designated hitter freshman Joe Vranesh who went three for four with one RBI.  The gusts blowing out to right field helped a couple balls that were struck in the gap by the Gaels, particularly on a double hit by catcher Jackson Thoreson (2 for 5, 1 RBI) to lead off the second inning. Later that inning, Thoreson would come around to score the first run for Saint Mary’s.</p>\n<p>Although hitting the ball well, the Gaels’ offense was helped by not only the wind but by the Gaucho defense as well.  In the top of the fifth inning, the ’Chos would commit four continuous errors. Two errors came from left fielder junior Colton Burns who has recently made the transition from second base to the outfield for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>For the first committed error, Burns would let a ball get by him on a routine base hit to the outfield. The ball would reach the fence allowing the batter to reach third.</p>\n<p>The second error happened after Burns dove head first for a ball, trapping it in his glove but losing sight of the ball below his feet allowing the runner to advance to second.</p>\n<p>Another error came on a grounder that took a wild hop on redshirt junior second baseman JJ Muno. Unfortunately for Muno, although doing his best to block the ball and pick it up with his bare hand, he had no play at first.</p>\n<p>The last of the errors came on a pop fly to third baseman redshirt junior Kenny Corey that was blown around by the swirling wind. The ball would hit off the end Corey’s glove and drop to the ground. All runners would be safe.</p>\n<p>From these four errors, two runs would score. If not for these blunders, the Gauchos would be looking at an entirely different game altogether in the bottom of the ninth, especially after Bush’s homerun.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who are now sitting at a .500 winning percentage, had a pretty decent home stand overall winning three games and losing one. Now the boys will head off to Kentucky this weekend to play three games of a long seven-game road series that will also feature four games at Brigham Young University the following week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/gauchos-doomed-by-several-errors-in-4-1-loss-versus-st-marys/","id":4141,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

that Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, wrote “The Crystal Ship” one night in Isla Vista during the 1960s when he was dropping acid on the beach and looking out at the bright, glimmering Platform Holly just off the coast.</p>\n<p>Now it appears the crystal ship will soon be sailing away.</p>\n<p>Venoco, Inc., the Denver-based oil company which owned Platform Holly, relinquished the oil platform and the rest of its holdings in the South Ellwood Oil Field to the state just before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.</p>\n<p>The oil platform has been inactive since the 2015 Refugio oil spill, when a Plains All American Pipeline ruptured and spilled 142,000 gallons of oil along the Gaviota Coast.</p>\n<p>The pipeline that burst, Line 901, fed oil to and from Platform Holly.</p>\n<p>The closure of Line 901 for the next two years decimated Venoco’s operations in the South Ellwood Oil Field and substantially curbed the company’s financial strength.</p>\n<p>The California State Lands Commission (SLC) now owns Platform Holly and announced in April that it will begin decommissioning the oil platform as soon as possible, a process that it said will be “expensive,” “complex” and “lengthy.”</p>\n<p>The SLC said it would soon begin the process of contracting a project manager to oversee the decommissioning process. The state agency estimates it will take approximately three years to fully decommission and remove Holly, but this estimate is “heavily dependent” on the availability of funding and equipment and the length of time it takes to identify the environmental impacts of removing the oil platform.</p>\n<p>Bob Evans, a local ocean photographer, spoke out to KEYT last week in opposition to a complete removal of Platform Holly, insisting that doing so would harm the marine life dwelling around the columns below.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lifetime taking underwater pictures in the California Channel Islands and I have never seen the amount of life that exists on these platforms, and it would be a travesty to remove these structures,” Evans told KEYT. “I am wondering who’s going to give the eviction notice to all the little creatures that live on Platform Holly?”</p>\n<p>Evans suggests the state remove only the top portion of the platform to keep the lower part as a marine sanctuary, KEYT reported.</p>\n<p>Still, decommissioning Holly comes as a major victory for local environmental efforts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77893\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1524158438\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77960\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77893\" data-attachment-id=\"77893\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/farewell-holly/img_9920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77893\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_9920.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“We have waited for this day for a long time,” Fran Farina of the local Sierra Club chapter said in a statement released the same day Venoco filed for bankruptcy.<br>\nARCO first constructed Platform Holly in 1966, and the oil rig reached peak production in 1984.</p>\n<p>Farina said that the Sierra Club has been combating offshore drilling in the area since the 1980s, when ARCO was looking build additional oil platforms near Holly.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Environmental Defense Center said in April that local environmental groups were “celebrating” the announcement of Platform Holly’s removal, explaining that Holly and other oil infrastructure in the area “pose a threat to public health and the environment.”</p>\n<p>Upon the removal of Platform Holly, there will be 26 offshore oil platforms remaining off the California coast between Orange County and Santa Barbara County, The Mercury News reported.</p>\n<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama implemented in November a temporary moratorium on all new offshore oil drilling off the California coast until 2022.</p>\n<p>Several California lawmakers applauded the decision but called on Obama to institute a permanent ban in light of Donald Trump’s promises to expand offshore oil drilling.</p>\n<p>Although President Trump has not made any tangible steps toward lifting Obama’s ban, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in March that opening federal waters for oil drilling is “a pillar of President Trump’s plan to make the United States energy independent.”</p>\n<p>Frustrated local environmental groups protested over 100-strong when Secretary Zinke visited Santa Barbara in April. They shouted, “Shame on you,” urging Zinke to remember the environmental fallout that followed the Refugio spill just two years prior.</p>\n<p>This controversy — along with decades of production, nostalgia and trauma surrounding Holly — will be awash as the crystal ship drifts away, leaving an expansive Pacific in its wake.</p>\n<p>The horizon’s glittering constant will soon disappear, and others will miss the memory of a proud ocean outlook peering through hazy Isla Vista nights.</p>\n<p>“The crystal ship is being filled<br>\nA thousand girls, a thousand thrills<br>\nA million ways to spend your time<br>\nWhen we get back, I’ll drop a line.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Platform Holly as an oil rig.
