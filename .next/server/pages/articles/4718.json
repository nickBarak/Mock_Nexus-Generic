After a walk, and a base hit by senior catcher Campbell Wear, a hit by pitch loaded the bases. An RBI base hit by Calica brought home Campbell as the go-ahead run. The Gauchos’ second run scored that inning went down as an unearned run on a BYU passed ball.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a good time to sit back on a pitch that I could handle well. It’s awesome to see that we had some good team at bats earlier that inning,” Calica said. “Good things happen when you get lead off guys on.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore right-handed pitcher Shane Bieber allowed only three hits and one run while striking out nine in eight innings pitched in his season debut during Saturday’s late game. Combined with ninth-inning sub-in, junior right-handed pitcher James Carter, the team allowed BYU only four hits.</p>\n<p>“It was a weird situation going in with a double-header, but I went in there trying to treat it as a normal start,” Bieber said. “I tried to get comfortable with my pitches as I went on, and I ended up getting more and more comfortable with each inning.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in Saturday’s morning 6-0 shutout, junior right-handed closer Dillon Tate started in place of junior lefty Domenic Mazza, allowing three hit and no runs, with eight recorded strikeouts in 25 batters faced through 6.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Tate’s usually our closer, but he really did a good job,” Checketts said. “He was really in control of that game. He had a great start and was dominant for those innings.”</p>\n<p>At the plate, UCSB’s lineup swung for twelve hits and six runs scored. Junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic recorded two of the teams four total RBIs, with three hits and one run scored. Redshirt senior second baseman Woody Woodward and senior catcher Campbell Wear made up the other two RBIs with one a piece.</p>\n<p>“We were good early, but they’ve given us a lot [of runs] defensively. Even today, they gave us one on a pass ball,” Checketts said. “We’re going to have to earn more of our runs, than have them give them to us.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s season opener, the Gauchos kicked off their winning weekend in front of a crowd of 411 attendants. UCSB allowed twelve hits turning into only one run for the Cougars, as the Gauchos capitalized for eight runs on 10 hits from across the lineup.</p>\n<p>The teams had Sunday off after Saturday’s double-header to prepare for today’s game. With the threat of going home empty handed in its first series, BYU must improve on its four errors made in the past three games.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure the guys will come out and run around on their own to make sure that they’re ready,” Checketts said. “The big thing is it Domenic Mazza will be able to throw for us. That’s a big question, is if he’s ready to go.”</p>\n<p>The teams will play today at 1 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for the last game of the series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/","id":4718,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4717,4716,4715],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Capture Series Victory Over UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite winning two of three games to win a weekend series against UC Riverside, the Gauchos felt they needed a sweep over the Highlanders and were disappointed with the lone loss.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 25 UCSB baseball team was one game away from completing a sweep of UC Riverside at home, but yesterday’s disappointing 7-3 loss left the Gauchos with a bittersweet feeling.</p>\n<p>“We really wanted and needed a sweep in terms of looking at the postseason,” junior second baseman Woody Woodward said. “Series wins are important, but in the position we’re in, we really wanted a sweep there.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing yesterday, the Gauchos improved to 26-11 overall and 7-8 in the Big West conference by winning the first two games of the series.

UCSB was down 4-0 as early as the first inning as freshman pitcher Shane Bieber struggled settling in. The Gaucho offense was kept in check by the Highlanders’ senior relief pitcher Dylan Stuart. Stuart entered the game in the fourth inning and had command of his four pitches to keep hitters guessing throughout his 5.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“They came out and scored four in the first; that’s usually tough to rebound from,” Woodward said. “Those are big momentum swings. We added on and responded and scored in the same inning — in the first — but it’s tough when you have a deficit like that early on. I think some things didn’t go our way (yesterday).”</p>\n<p>UCSB mounted a come-from-behind 6-5 win on Saturday after erasing a two-run deficit. Down 5-3 in the sixth inning, the Gauchos got the ball rolling on a double that brought junior outfielder Cameron Newell home from first base.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders went down quietly in the top of the seventh inning, Santa Barbara began the bottom half with consecutive singles to put runners on first and second base. UCSB was quick to capitalize on the situation when UCR committed a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt that brought in the runner from second. With one out and the scored tied, Newell gave UCSB the lead with an RBI groundout before the inning ended.</p>\n<p>Now with a one-run lead, Head Coach Andrew Checketts elected to bring in his shutdown closer, sophomore Dillon Tate, for the two-inning save. The right-hander had his usual stuff working and converted his tenth save of the season, with five of the six outs recorded coming by way of strikeout.</p>\n<p>“We rely on Dillon to do that when he comes in the game,” junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “We think he’s going to get it done. It wasn’t a surprise to any of us how he performed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was in full control in the series’ opening game on Friday, coming out with a 6-2 win behind the stellar pitching of sophomore Justin Jacome. Jacome tossed 6.1 innings of three-hit ball and gave up only two runs on the day to improve his record to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>“He did a good job throwing strikes and pounding the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He struggled a little bit with his command early and was able to find it; he did a good job.”</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris led the way offensively for Santa Barbara with a three-hit performance. Maris tripled in the first inning to bring in a runner from first base and then came home on a sacrifice fly to give UCSB a 2-0 lead. Maris once again came to bat with a runner on second in the sixth inning and singled to left field to tack on another run for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCR got back to into the game with a two-run seventh inning, however, Santa Barbara countered with a three-run effort in the bottom half to push its lead to 6-2 and put away the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play UCLA at home on Tuesday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/","id":4715,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4714,4713,4712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dillon Tate Q and A: Food, Music and Baseball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=853%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay sat down with Gaucho pitcher Dillon Tate for a fun Q and A session.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a fastball clocking in at over 95 mph and a nasty slider that makes some batters look like little leaguers, sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate has established himself this season as one of the best closers in the nation.

But I’d say the calendars we have set up on the computer help me a lot to get organized and just being really cautious of my time and trying to manage. That is what helps me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So what are some of the things you like to do to relax?</p>\n<p>A: I enjoy going to the beach in my spare time. I don’t really get much spare time, but on my off days I like to go down to the beach after class with all my teammates, and we’ll play catch on the beach, which is pretty nice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: When you want that cheap meal, what’s your favorite place in I.V. to hit up?</p>\n<p>A: There’s a number of different places in I.V. that I can go to for some cheap meals. The Habit is a pretty good place to go for a cheap meal or Kaptain’s Barbeque is a place I enjoy going to. And if I’m not in I.V. or one of those places, I will probably go to In-N-Out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Before every game what music do you play to get you pumped up?</p>\n<p>A: That’s a good question. I always try to listen to some of the same songs on my phone when I’m in the clubhouse before the game. Just rap, I would say. I listen to Rick Ross before a game. That’s something I’ve done continuously before every game — just that same [Rick Ross] song right before I go out on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which song is it?</p>\n<p>A: It’s called “9 Piece.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’ve been playing baseball for such a long time. Do you ever get tired of the sport?</p>\n<p>A: I would say no. The only thing I would get tired with sometimes is practice because it’s kind of the same old routine in that it gets tedious, but I’m not really tired of it. The only reason I would probably get tired of the sport I feel like is when I’m out in the field and I don’t have anything to eat, and I get hungry. Because then I get kind of cranky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Do you ever take some of that crankiness out on your teammates? Can they tell?</p>\n<p>A: Maybe some of them can, like some of the other pitchers because we have the same rotation together sometimes. So when we share these rotations together I feel like some of them might see that like, “Oh, Dillon is getting pretty cranky” or “Dillon must be hungry.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which baseball team do you root for?</p>\n<p>A: I really like the Red Sox, not because they won the World Series this past year, but I’ve been a fan of them since 2003 when they lost in the ALCS to the Yankees. That’s kind of odd how a loss in the playoffs was something that attracted to me to another team. But it wasn’t so much a loss, but just the way they played, that I was attracted to.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So I’m guessing you really hate Aaron Boone then?</p>\n<p>A: Not a fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about Derek Jeter? Are you sad he’s retiring?</p>\n<p>A: Not really sad, but even though he’s on the Yankees and everything, that’s someone that I feel everyone in baseball looks up to … I feel like people in Boston don’t loathe him or anything, but they respect him for what he’s done and how he’s been in the game so long.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Any animosity toward Jacoby Ellsbury?</p>\n<p>A: Ahhh! That’s just a tough situation. He was a really big part of [the Red Sox] and it really sucks to lose someone like that, but I mean you got to think the individual player has to do what’s best for them. I think that’s what he did; he just did something that was best for him and so he went to the Yankees. It sucks to see him go, but you got to respect it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about you personally? Any game that you had a big role in that stands out to you?</p>\n<p>A: There haven’t been any games that stand out to me personally, but I’d say close games we win are highlights for me. Any game we win where I’m pitching or not pitching is always good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s been your most embarrassing moment on the field while playing for UCSB?</p>\n<p>A: I don’t really have one. I really haven’t [had] one that embarrassing yet, so I will keep my fingers crossed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did anything embarrassing in high school happen to you?</p>\n<p>A: Oh high school, definitely. I was at third base once, and this guy hit a swinging bunt. We were playing our rival school and I went up to get the swinging bunt, and I missed it under my glove. And I tried to turn around really fast to go get it, and my foot just came out from under me, and I just fell on my back. That was pretty bad — people were laughing at me and everything.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one thing you can’t live without?</p>\n<p>A: Probably my music is one thing I couldn’t live without. That’s something I need every day; I wake up, and I play my music and I ride my bike to class.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Baseball players are pretty famous for having these insane pregame rituals. Do you have one?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t even call it a ritual; I would call it more of a routine. As far as my routine goes, I come to the field with my headphones on and after we’re done taking batting practice — well, I got to back up a little bit — I stretch the same person out every day, even in practice. After we’re done with batting practice I go into the clubhouse, I eat my sandwich and I always listen to music, and I listen to that same song right before I take the field. So that would be something that’s part of my routine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So you bump that same Rick Ross song every single time?</p>\n<p>A: Yeah. I might listen to a couple different songs before, while I’m relaxing watching TV, but it’s primarily music that gets me game ready and focused. And I always end the playlist with that Rick Ross song.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I have to check that song out. His last album was pretty good.</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, I enjoyed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Yeah, “Sanctified” is my favorite song on the album.</p>\n<p>A: I’d say the second song is my favorite on the album.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Is that “The Devil is a Lie” with Jay-Z ?</p>\n<p>A: No, it’s “Rich is Gangsta.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one team you hate losing to the most?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t say there’s one team in particular I hate losing to, but it’d probably be just any team we lose to. I don’t like it. Especially home losses. Home losses are one thing I really can’t stand because I just don’t like it when another team takes the mound after you lose, and they walk on your mound … I feel we should beat everyone we play because I think the guys on the team are that good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Now finish this sentence for me. UCSB will make it to Omaha if…</p>\n<p>A: … the Gauchos continue to play well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Simple as that?</p>\n<p>A: It’s as simple as that. If we continue to play well, we will make it to Omaha.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55082\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55082\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/dillon-tate-q-and-a-food-music-and-baseball/","id":4716,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4715,4714,4713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos and Bruins Tie in 12 Innings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB and UCLA tied after 12 innings of play due to darkness coming over Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Yesterday was a missed opportunity for the No. 24 UCSB baseball team.

UCLA also receives its first draw of the year and moves to 22-19-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After junior starting pitcher Andrew Vasquez pitched himself out of danger in the first inning, the left-hander put himself in a hole once more in the following inning. With runners on second and third base, UCLA managed to earn the game’s first run with a single, followed by a two-run RBI that chased Vasquez from the game. UCLA would put up one more run after the pitching change as Vasquez was charged with all four runs despite allowing only three hits in total.</p>\n<p>“His stuff wasn’t very good. I think he was a little flat,” Checketts said. “His command was just okay. He didn’t have great stuff today. The ball wasn’t coming out of his hand very good.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began clawing its way back into the game by scoring a run in the bottom half of the inning. After a walk and double that put two runners in scoring position, UCLA retired the next two batters but allowed a run on a fielding error that brought UCSB within three runs.</p>\n<p>Down 4-1 in the third inning, the Gauchos tied the score with one swing of the bat. With two runners on base, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa smashed a three-run blast over the right field fence for his team-leading ninth homerun of the season. It was his first since April 4 after he went a stretch of 37 at-bats without hitting one.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to get something up in the zone, something elevated,” Kuresa said. “We had a runner on third with one out; I was just trying to hit a sac-fly and not a double play. I was pretty surprised he gave me a fastball there. He missed over the middle, and I put a good swing on it.”</p>\n<p>The tie did not last long as UCLA manufactured a run in the next inning against sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza, who came in relief for Vasquez. Mazza allowed a runner to reach first base, resulting in a successful steal of second after. The Bruins capitalized with another single to take the lead once more.</p>\n<p>Now trailing, Santa Barbara remained persistent on offense and managed to tie the game once more. With consecutive hits to put runners on first and second base, junior shortstop Peter Maris advanced to within 90 feet from the plate on a fly-out. In need of a clutch hit, freshman center fielder Andrew Calica delivered with an RBI up the middle to complete the 5-5 comeback.</p>\n<p>“We got some toughness,” Checketts said. “We’ve been down because the starting pitching hasn’t been very good this year. So we’ve been chasing runs quite a bit and have had a lot of situations like that. The guys definitely did a good job of coming back.”</p>\n<p>With 10 runs combined through the first five innings, the game from there on turned into a battle between the bullpens. After Mazza pitched an efficient 4.1 innings, allowing only one earned run, Checketts handed the ball over to junior Greg Mahle. Mahle retired the first three batters faced in the seventh inning and had a quick eighth inning to end his appearance.</p>\n<p>Despite not scoring for the rest of the game, the Gauchos did have opportunities to break the deadlock. UCSB put runners on the corners in the sixth inning for senior left fielder Joey Epperson, the team’s leading hitter. However, Epperson came up empty as he popped up to the shortstop to end the inning. In the following inning, the Gauchos failed to bring in Kuresa from third base after junior outfielder Scott Quinlan struck out looking with two outs.</p>\n<p>UCSB used just four pitchers for the entire game, including using sophomore closer Dillon Tate for the final four innings. Tate was on point in his appearance, striking out four batters on only 56 pitches. His combination of fastball and sinker kept UCLA from scoring.</p>\n<p>“I give all the credit in the world to Dillon,” Kuresa said. “He pitched a good game and they couldn’t do anything against him, too.”</p>\n<p>After 12 innings of play and with night starting to become a factor, the umpires called the game as a 5-5 draw.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its biggest series of the season against first-place in the Big West UC Irvine beginning this Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/","id":4717,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4716,4715,4714],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
