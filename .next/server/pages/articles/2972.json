According to Williams, the roundtable ended with an “overwhelming consensus” that campuses must do more to protect students.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the rate of sexual violence on college campuses is “unacceptable,” citing that one in five students are estimated to be the victims of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“Nothing has really been done, at least effectively, to address campus sexual violence,” Jackson said. “[I’m] mad as hell about this situation … This is simply unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, Williams has made extensive efforts to address sexual violence on campus by developing the two-part roundtable discussion with his committee and by co-authoring a legislative bill that calls for more action from college campuses to address sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“We really need to address this problem through education, prevention, deterrence, treatment and action,” Jackson said. “Those who are found to have violated what is I think … is simply an appropriate code of conduct need to have drastic steps taken to punish and discourage that behavior going forward.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she is in support of legislative efforts toward ensuring that those who sexually assault individuals are rightfully prosecuted.</p>\n<p>“Yes needs to mean yes,” Jackson said. “We can no longer accept a culture that excuses rape, that condones rape, that protects rape or sexual violence anywhere, let alone on our college campuses.”</p>\n<p>One heavily discussed topic during the roundtable regarded the process by which non-UCSB student perpetrators are currently dealt with and how that process can be improved. According to Associate Dean for Student Wellness Angela Andrade, the university may look at cases where non-students are sexually assaulted or harassed, but can only administer punishments to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We look at those cases and see if there’s anything we can do, but ultimately … our campus regulations [only] gives us the authority to discipline students that are enrolled at UCSB,” Andrade said.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Partee, the Dean of Educational Programs at Santa Barbara City College, said that while SBCC does not have their own police team to enforce anti-sexual assault policies, the college maintains good communication with the SBCC Office of Student Life, Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the Santa Barbara County Police Department and UCSB Police Department.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re going in the right direction as two entities that have individual students in Isla Vista,” Partee said, “and it’s our hope that we can help eliminate the assaults.”</p>\n<p>Katie, a UCSB student and sexual assault victim who chose to withhold her last name for personal reasons, said her experience working with the university was entirely positive, in terms of academic accommodations and understanding her options, but that problems arose along the way.</p>\n<p>“My real issues didn’t start until the investigation got underway with law enforcement,” Katie said.</p>\n<p>Katie said she made the report because she did not want to be one of the many victims of assault who do not have their case heard. However, Katie said she encountered “a lot of insensitivity” in the way IVFP dealt with her case.</p>\n<p>“It was just a process of re-victimization,” Katie said. “I feel like I went through way more pain than I needed to and had to tell way more people my story. Things don’t get to a hearing because there are so many reasons that people are discouraged before having a chance to get to there.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said that sometimes officers working with sexual assault and harassment victims fail to handle the situation out of a lack of understanding and experience.</p>\n<p>“We need to continue to work on that training and to make an effort to build that relationship and improve our abilities to work with the survivors of these assaults,” Signa said. “It’s an ongoing process, we’re not perfect. We’re trying to do the best we can. We need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she applauds progress made to combat sexual assault and harassment cases on campus, but that they are only beginning and that more serious punishment for perpetrators are in order.</p>\n<p>“[Students] are going to be our leaders in the future, and if we cannot do that then we have failed the university,” Jackson said. “We will have failed our young people, both men and women, and we will not be doing our job.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said she feels frustrated that, despite years of activism, not enough has been done to establish a “culture of no excuses.”</p>\n<p>“There’s no excuse for rape. There is no excuse for blaming the victim and there is no excuse for not supporting the victim and prosecuting … whether it’s the criminal context or whether it’s in the university,” Jackson said. “Someone who commits rape should not be a student at the University of California and should not be a student at Santa Barbara City College or any of our schools of higher education.”</p>\n<p>A

serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The California Coastal Commission approved UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) Thursday, which will add 5,000 undergraduate students and hundreds of faculty and staffers to the university by 2025.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The LRDP, also called ‘Vision 2025,’ was prepared by university officials after reviewing projected enrollment demands and analyzing limitations of campus, traffic, expenses and feedback from the community. Coastal Commission staff member Shana Grey presented the plan, which details a one percent annual enrollment increase until 2025 to a maximum enrollment of 25,000 students. The current LRDP was created in 1990 and the new drafts were released in March 2008, followed by a public hearing in June 2008.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The new plan will involve campus development, including changes in academic programs and increased campus housing for students, faculty and staff. According to a LRDP statement, the additional housing developments could exacerbate issues related to water usage, traffic circulation and greenhouse gas emissions but have held public hearings extending public comment on the development. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">California Coastal Commission Vice-Chair Jana Zimmer said university officials and environmental consultants discussed issues concerning the higher demand of water supply a larger student population would cause.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">We discussed the water supply issue at some length,” Zimmer said. “There is additional capacity in the reclaimed water system that is about one-half capacity now.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher said considerations for additional parking space will be a crucial aspect to the development plan.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Transportative systems and alternative transportation as opposed to vehicular and loads of transportation that we are accustomed to and the role of parking in the whole analysis is critically important,” Fisher said. “I hope that we will have an Isla Vista parking program as part of the county update to the Isla Vista master plan.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Deputy Director of the South Central Coast District John Ainsworth said the renewal of the LRDP was difficult but successful.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The preparation of this review LRDP update has been a long, and let me say, complicated process, stretching out over a number of years,” Ainsworth said. “The staff, the university, and the coalition of environmental groups are all now in agreement — and this is a huge achievement in my view.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the UC Regents as well as faculty members from Goleta and Santa Barbara have been supportive of the LRDP. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">During the past 10 years we have gone through very thorough, very collaborative, extremely consultative, transparent and public processes,” Yang said. “Our LRDP plan had the approval in full support from University of California Regents, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and Goleta City Council.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Yang, the LRDP was drafted with consideration for the surrounding community in mind. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">We have held 65 public meetings leading up to the plans submittal to the Coastal Commission,” Yang said. “We have invited and implemented an extraordinary amount of community input.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Applications to the university have doubled in the last decade and enrollment has been capped at 20,000 for several years.
