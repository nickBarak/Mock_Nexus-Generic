I decided [during] my freshman year to get involved and see if I can help out as much as I can,” Griffin said in a statement to the board prior to his appointment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said he first saw the open seat while </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-22/recap-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs-candidate-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">running for Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/campus-united-reclaims-executive-branch-stronghold-maintains-senate-majority/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2019 elections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At the time, he realized that he didn’t want to get elected as both EVPLA and IVRPD director and not have sufficient time for both positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After losing [the EVPLA] election, I decided that this was another way I could give back, and the board position was still open. I was lucky enough to get it, and I’m happy to be on it,” Griffin said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the newest member of the board, one of Griffin’s first goals is to renovate two of the parks in I.V.: Walter Capps Park and Pardall Gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said Walter Capps Park, a large tract of dirt and grass located oceanside at the beginning of the 67 block of Del Playa Drive, has recently been discussed as a site for renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been in the talks recently to put together a plan to build a park there and to have different facilities like work-out stations and shade structures. So I’d like to be a part of the design of that which will be happening hopefully within the next year,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also wants to renovate Pardall Gardens, which neighbors Lao Wang on Pardall Road and currently houses a few benches and sparse shrubbery. Griffin wants to “transition the park to become a space utilized by students and community members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also looking forward to the implementation of the first solar table at the southeast corner of People’s Park. The solar table will house outlets charged by solar panels and was a project initially started in the EVPLA office under Jeike Meijer, who served as EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation has been laid, and the table will hopefully be installed and ready by Fall Quarter 2019, according to Griffin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To familiarize himself with the IVRPD’s revenue, Griffin said he intends to join the Finance Committee. Soutar and Bernard are the current directors on the committee; Bernard replaced Washington following her resignation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I want] to figure out exactly where the tax revenues come from and how to maintain the balance budget that we’ve had recently for the next few years going forward,” Griffin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be able to learn how to manage and still provide very good resources for our community but still maintain that healthy side of the financials.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside working on financials within the IVRPD, Griffin also wants to collaborate with the EVPLA office and the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) on future projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to spread awareness about I.V.’s history by creating a timeline of I.V.’s history in the new community center — which is set to have a soft opening in August — in order to create a stronger connection between the long-term residents and students.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [July 31, 12:30 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Matthew Griffin had said “stage structures” instead of “shade structures” in regards to Walter Capps Park.

According to Fischer, students and long-term residents complained about the bench’s constant occupation, noting that it deteriorated the curb appeal of the intersection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the bench was removed and broken into “a whole bunch of pieces,” according to Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould. Following the removal of the bench, Gould said the Public Works Department approached the IVRPD, asking if they would like to keep the pieces.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had an offer to receive all these slabs of stone and big boulders and we said, ‘Yes, please, we’ll take them,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD had the Public Works Department deliver the pieces to the Sueno Bark Park, where they plan to permanently keep the benches after they are rebuilt, according to Gould. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD plans to “reconstruct [the bench] into two, probably three separate smaller benches,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is currently no plan to have an unveiling for the new benches, Gould said the IVRPD plans to have them finished before May 18, the day of their planned “Bark Party” at the Sueno Bark Park. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On May 18, we’re having an event in the dog park called ‘Bark Party.’ We’ve got ‘Care For Paws’ out there doing free or discounted immunizations for dogs and Pet Smart’s giving away coupons and stuff.

This year, the count reported 670 sheltered and 1,133 unsheltered individuals.</p>\n<p>Additionally, 42% of the 1,133 unsheltered individuals lived in their vehicles. According to the report, the CoC interpreted this data with the help of new technologies involved in the count and demographic information provided from the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program.</p>\n<p>The program provides support and safe overnight parking for houseless individuals or families living in their vehicles, <a href=\"https://sbnbcc.org/safe-parking/\">according to the official Safe Parking page on the New Beginnings Counseling Center’s official website. </a></p>\n<p>The report also revealed, through survey questions about individuals’ last permanent residence, that the majority of the houseless population is local – meaning those individuals became houseless while living in Santa Barbara. Over 75% of current houseless people became houseless during their time of residence in Santa Barbara and 60% have resided in the county for more than 10 years, if not most of their lives.</p>\n<p>In response to the count, the County is currently drafting a plan to address houselessness, according to the count press release.</p>\n<p>“More and more, you’ll read about how the state of California is actually starting to really invest in solutions to homelessness and affordable housing,” Emily Allen, program director at United Way of Northern Santa Barbara County, said. “They are also requiring that communities have you know a P.I.T. count and that they have a plan in place and that they have strategies for evaluating how effective programs are.”</p>\n<p>The count is conducted by community volunteers recruited by the Northern Santa Barbara County United Way Home for Good, the organization which carries out the count, according to the press release. Volunteers attended a training session and then set out for the count at 5 a.m. on Jan. 2. This year, almost 450 volunteers showed up for the count in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Volunteers conducted “complete counts” and surveys, in which the volunteers, sometimes with the help of homeless guides, covered every census tract in the county, save for the Channel Islands and certain parts of the Los Padres National Forest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is trained to either administer the survey where we ask people certain HUD-required questions, or if [a homeless person] says ‘I don’t wanna do the survey’ you’re still on your smartphone using an app,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers could also conduct observational surveys instead of direct surveys and questioning in cases where houseless people were not comfortable answering questions.</p>\n<p>Surveying the houseless population provides insight about the conditions of houseless across communities, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“This surveying helps us to understand… who’s experiencing homelessness is fairly similar from community to community,” she said.</p>\n<p>The surveys also help United Way to better understand the varying needs of houseless individuals and how to best help them, Allen said.</p>\n<p>“We also know that the solutions are housing and supportive services and a lot of the people that do survey, they do need different types of supportive service with their housing,” she added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County also took part in the 100,000 Homes Campaign, a country-wide effort in 2011 to create “by-name” lists of houseless people, pinpoint who the most vulnerable populations, and to ultimately house 100,000 people, Allen said.</p>\n<p>Allen and other community organizations in the Santa Barbara County “were a part of that effort… and from that we’ve continued feeling like it was important to have a lot of volunteers engaged in the Count and make sure that we were really getting information about what was going on in our community,” hence the creation of the SB County’s Home for Good program.</p>\n<p>Following the first count in 2011, one goal of the program has been to keep people engaged in a plethora of ways even after the official P.I.T. Count, in ways that will hopefully address the needs revealed by the report.</p>\n<p>“So I would say [the P.I.T Count is] not just for the federal government,” Allen said. She stated that “more and more it’s also the state government” that has begun taking a closer look at the roots and solutions to houselessness.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/biennial-homeless-count-finds-33-houseless-individuals-living-in-i-v/","id":3720,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3719,3718,3717],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
