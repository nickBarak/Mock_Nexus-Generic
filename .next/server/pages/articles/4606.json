Clinic Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed the parking permit program, funded by the county or potential Community Services District, and voiced concerns and requests regarding its implementation. A record of the discussion was kept to one day present overall findings to various governing bodies. Upcoming meetings will discuss the permit exclusivity for I.V. residents, showing proof of residency for permits and UCSB’s responsibility in addressing the issue. The next parking permit meeting will be held on Sunday, Nov. 22 at 4 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Building.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Bruce Murdock said he estimates around 30 to 40 percent of people who park in Isla Vista are students and faculty using the town as alternative campus parking.</p>\n<p>“The number of people that go to UCSB, both faculty and students, don’t want to pay the fees to park on campus so they come and park in Isla Vista,” Murdock said. “They are people that are from the outside and parked there so they can go to the campus.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car. How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?<br>\n<em>– I.V. resident Bruce Murdock</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I.V. resident Peter Neushul said the amount of parking in I.V. does not coincide with its resident population.</p>\n<p>“The new towers and new villages going up are going to have staff and those staff are going to want to park for free in our town,” Neushul said. “So it has to be looked upon as it is something that is just going to get worse and something that now encircles the entire Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the demand for street parking will decrease if property owners lower in-unit parking fees.</p>\n<p>“If we could make it so that the landlords that are providing parking weren’t charging extra for parking … that would lessen some of the load on the on-street parking,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said landlords cannot alleviate the issue by lowering fees because there are not enough parking spaces on the properties.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got an apartment that has 30 students and you have 10 parking places you can pass all the laws you want and write all the reports you want, you’ve still only got 10 parking spaces,” Murdock said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66502\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66502\" data-attachment-id=\"66502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/parking_by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447611919\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parking Commission Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66502\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1-250x166.jpg?resize=350%2C232\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Murdock also said many I.V. residents who have access to parking garages fail to use them.</p>\n<p>“Its purpose is to park a car, now how many of the garages that are affiliated with apartments and or houses do they park cars in? Not many,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said future permit plans should reference previous I.V. parking regulation attempts, such as the Isla Vista Master Plan parking management program of 2004 which was denied by the Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>“Coastal Commission’s main priority is to protect access of the public to the coast … that access points can be parked in at reasonable fees so that the beaches of California remain accessible to everybody,” Freeman said. “They end up in a strange position when communities like us come to them with parking programs.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB should discourage first-year students from bringing their cars to Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If the University provided that as a really strong statement in their introductory material to send to their parents, then the parents would have a strong influence on their children, saying ‘well the University really doesn’t want you to have a car there,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said freshman students have a “right” to car ownership.</p>\n<p>“I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car,” Murdock said. “How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB will not voluntarily alleviate the I.V. parking problem without incentive.</p>\n<p>“We need to be thinking about how to exert leverage outside the University in order to get them to do things we might want them to do,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Hammond said a mobile home site for students living in trailers could be an alternative parking solution.</p>\n<p>“A better solution might be to try and build some sort of trailer park somewhere for people who live in trailers or in their cars to park safely,” Hammond said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said instead of I.V. parking officers determining whether cars are parked for more than 72 hours by chalking tires, officers could implement a pay-by-plate program.</p>\n<p>“You have an SUV drive through I.V. and as it drives through I.V., it is scanning all the license plates that are along the side of the road and determining what cars are in what positions,” Freeman said. “And then if you want to buy a permit you don’t have to decide on a parking spot, you aren’t tied to a spot, you can just pay by tying your license plate into either a kiosk or a website or over the phone. That means that we can have visitor parking to be essentially any spot we want in I.V.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

In the meeting, students, long-term residents and representatives from the Santa Barbara County considered the possibility of creating an I.V. Code Enforcement Program allowing the CSD to enforce building and zoning codes in I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Deputy Director of Planning and Development Glenn Russell, the cost to expand the County’s current Code Enforcement Program would be approximately $235,000 a year, and it would cost an I.V. CSD about $20,000 to $25,000 to get the program started.</p>\n<p>“$235,000 is a reasonable estimate,” Russell said. “It could be a little bit more. It could be a little bit less.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee Jonathan Abboud said Russell’s estimate for the Code Enforcement Program is significantly larger than the $120,000 estimated in the Financial Analysis Study The Fund for Santa Barbara released in September 2015.</p>\n<p>“That sounds like a lot of money,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Russell, the current Code Enforcement Program only investigates building and zoning code violations if residents report them to the county.</p>\n<p>“What we have today is a reactive code enforcement program, both for building and zoning violations,” Russell said. “Anybody in Isla Vista who reports a building or zoning violation can have it investigated.”</p>\n<p>Russell said a “proactive” Code Enforcement Program — one where Program officials can exercise their police powers to bring residences up to code — would raise the possibility of evicting residents for zoning violations, which is the protocol for enforcing such codes.</p>\n<p>“Be careful what you wish for,” Russell said. “You have to be very judicious in how you apply these limited police powers. A proactive Code Enforcement Program would put people out of their lodging.”</p>\n<p>According to Field Representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Cameron Schunk, the structure of an I.V. CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will largely depend upon the funding it receives from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be largely contingent on what we hear from UCSB as far as what they want to contribute towards what type of program they want to see,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said University administrators discussed the possibility of opening University housing to students the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program temporarily evicts as incentive to bring their residencies up to code.</p>\n<p>“There were talks amongst administrative officials about offering some of the University’s housing as kind of temporary assistance housing if we decided to pursue some sort of code enforcement to bring the housing stock of I.V. back up to an acceptable level,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>With this option, however, Schunk said there is a “hidden catch” that the evicted students’ landlord might decrease the number of bedrooms in the residence.</p>\n<p>“There’s no guarantee that you’re going to have a place to go back to,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>As a solution for assisting evicted residents, Abboud said he suggests the I.V. CSD create a temporary housing fund.</p>\n<p>“If the I.V. CSD did implement this, we could have a small fund to help people who got kicked out to find temporary relocation for a month until they could move back into their place once it’s up to code,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she is concerned about the possibility of evicting I.V. residents for violating zoning codes, such as by living in a closet or a garage.</p>\n<p>“These sort of people are not living in those conditions because they want to. It is because they have no other resources,” Dela Cruz said. “I think it’s important for us to keep that in mind that there are larger reasons for why these issues are occurring in our community, and we need to think about that as well while we’re thinking about this program.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66897\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"128780311\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66919\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66897\" data-attachment-id=\"66897\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/stakeholders-discuss-code-enforcement-program/iv-stakeholders-121-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"IV Stakeholders discussing the current county coe enforcement, and what would happen if we were switched to proactive enforcement.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1448996545\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"IV Stakeholders 12\\/1\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Stakeholders 12/1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66897\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stakeholders_by-John-Clow-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66897\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Russell, however, a Code Enforcement Program cannot ignore violations for the sake of avoiding the eviction of residents, as it must be consistent in enforcing violations.</p>\n<p>“You can’t ignore something someplace because you just feel bad,” Russell said. “You have to be absolutely consistent and even-handed.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said she hopes the CSD’s Code Enforcement Program will provide opportunities for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in hearing about the students and the involvement we may have in this Code Enforcement Program,” Dela Cruz said. “This is something that I think the university is very interested in.

They say students will be able to celebrate the students’ lives rather than solely grieving their deaths.</p>\n<p>“This year we just wanted to really again create the same feeling again of unity but also make sure it has a positive spin to it,” said fourth-year communication and art double major Raphaella Faria. “That’s how we decided to create a live carnival and integrate everyone, students, community members.”</p>\n<p>Faria, who helped start Blunite in 2015 with a fellow student and art professor Kim Yasuda, hopes that students can enjoy the prizes, photo booth and crafts while understanding the deeper meaning of the lights.</p>\n<p>“People can expect to have lots of fun, to see lots of lights,” Faria said. “We really wanted to focus on using the LED lights as our symbol.”</p>\n<p>Several I.V. businesses have joined the cause as well, with Otaco, Hana Kitchen and Sorriso Italiano, among others, displaying blue lights. IV Drip created a Blunite cookie and Woodstock’s Pizza will be selling blue beer.</p>\n<p>Faria, who was at UCSB at the time of the shooting, said students must remember that families in I.V. remain even while thousands of students leave each year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70971\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70971\" data-attachment-id=\"70971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-14/blue-lights-in-peoples-park-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy/blunite-prep-jenny-luo-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Blunite Prep\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70971\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blunite-Prep-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=368%2C245\" alt=\"People's Park will be glowing Saturday night as attendees can expect carnival games, prizes and lives DJs.

We want to make sure that this is something that would be able to be commemorated and celebrated after all of the classes leave.”</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, a transfer student, said seeing the community come together after the tragedy was a big reason why he chose to transfer to UCSB. Collins hopes Blunite can help bring students together who may not normally interact.</p>\n<p>“It’s more than just the tragedy,” Collins said. “It’s more about uniting, and that’s what Blunite is about: the uniting, more than anything, of people who never come in contact with each other.”</p>\n<p>Collins, who was breathing heavily Friday after carrying giant cinder block stands from UCSB’s Theatre Department to People’s Park, said it would be hard for students to miss the park on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>“If you’re in IV, you’re going to know that there’s something going on,” he

Basilio / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>Firefighters responded around 7 p.m. to reports of a possible structure fire in an apartment at 785 Camino Del Sur in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside a first-floor apartment, Santa Barbara County firefighters found that a cutting board had been left inside a cooking oven, producing smoke that drifted out of the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firefighters unplugged the electric oven and brought it outside the building as a fan blew smoke out of the way.</span></p>\n<p>A next door neighbor called 911 after smelling smoke, a firefighter on the scene said. Two fire engines, a firetruck, a rescue ambulance and a battalion chief initially responded to the fire.</p>\n<p>The firefighter on the scene said the area was safe and that the fire had been contained to the oven.</p>\n<p>Residents evacuated some rooms adjacent to the apartment, but by 7:30 p.m. several people were re-entering their homes. No injuries were reported.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/cutting-board-left-in-oven-causes-fire-on-camino-del-sur/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/cutting-board-left-in-oven-causes-fire-on-camino-del-sur/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/cutting-board-left-in-oven-causes-fire-on-camino-del-sur/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/cutting-board-left-in-oven-causes-fire-on-camino-del-sur/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/cutting-board-left-in-oven-causes-fire-on-camino-del-sur/","id":4605,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[4604,4603,4602],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
