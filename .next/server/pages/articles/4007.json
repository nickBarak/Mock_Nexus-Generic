It did damage to the ecosystem, the environment and the economy,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Carbajal is hopeful for his new bill, noting that the bill has a better chance of passing since it was submitted to a congress where a Republican majority is no longer in effect.</p>\n<p>“[In] the last congress, I was a minority, and the Republican lead leadership did not allow this to move forward. I’m very excited about the prospects this time around,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Of the 53 representatives in California, 42 have co-signed California Clean Coast Act, also known as HR 279, reflecting current sentiments to orient the state toward renewable energy  and away from oil and gas.</p>\n<p>“These are not abstract issues for the Central Coast and Santa Barbara. These are issues that we’ve experienced and to us, it’s tangible,” Carbajal said. “We need to wean ourselves and become less dependent on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>In addition to HR 279, Carbajal has also proposed legislation on the subject of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>“Last term I introduced — which I am going to reintroduce again — the Renewable Energy opportunities legislation, which provides tax incentives to the business community so they invest in renewable energy technology.”</p>\n<p>The California Clean Coast Act would only be applied to the coastline and waters of California.</p>\n<p>To address California lands, Jackson, a state senator representing Santa Barbara’s 19th district, introduced Senate Bill 169, a new piece of legislation dealing with pipeline safety requirements, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>The current regulations in place allow pipeline operations in California to exploit loopholes within the state’s legal system, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“If you are operating a pipeline to full capacity, you have to follow California’s law. If, however, you are only operating to partial capacity, you don’t have to follow California law,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>SB 169 would require that all pipelines in California, regardless of their operation capacity, follow the same regulations, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The bill would also ensure pipeline inspectors have the tools necessary to verify that all pipeline operations in the state are in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>Jackson is hopeful that SB 169 will pass.</p>\n<p>“I’m confident that the legislature recognizes the importance of protecting against these spills,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Jackson still holds some doubt about the fate of Carbajal’s legislation.</p>\n<p>She said that Carbajal’s “aspirational” bill would likely face legislative friction if it ever made an appearance on President Trump’s desk. However, she said the next couple of years could provide a less hostile environment for green legislation.</p>\n<p>“If we have a positive result in 2020, this is certainly the kind of thing that we should be pushing from,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>After previous attempts to remediate pipeline safety requirements through legislation, Jackson said she believes that there is only one definitive way to end disasters like this: “If you don’t drill, you can’t spill.”</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at maxabrams@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-93304\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">With all precincts reporting, Cole ended the night with 32.15% of the vote. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the 3rd District supervisor seat saw a close start between incumbent Joan Hartmann, a registered Democrat and challenger Bruce Porter, who ran with no party in the recent election. The vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results showed Hartmann and Porter nearly tied, with 43.79% and 43.34% of the vote, respectively. Karen Jones lagged behind, with 7.78% of the vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that as a general rule, Republicans and conservatives vote early and vote by mail. So the fact that I was not behind was a very good [start] for the rest of the [race],” Hartmann said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the early tie, Porter said, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were deeply gratified and honored by the support we’ve received in early results. We believe that our message of Independence and commitment to bringing a new voice to all residents resonated deeply with voters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night went on and precincts began reporting results, Hartmann gained a strong lead as Porter began to fall behind. With 21 of the 49 precincts reporting as of midnight on March 4, Hartmann had 51.77% of the vote, Porter had 35.81% and Jones followed with 6.8%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the county released the semi-official results, Hartmann maintained her lead with 52.26% of the vote, while Porter stayed behind with 35.71%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the official certified results are released by the Santa Barbara County Elections Division, there is the possibility of the vote continuing to the November general election. For Hartmann to clinch the 3rd District supervisor seat, she must receive 50% plus one of the votes in the primary election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With over 30,000 ballots still to be tallied county-wide, it’s too soon to draw any definite conclusions from the current totals,” Porter said in a statement courtesy of Mathew Burciaga, Porter’s communications director. “The Porter for Supervisor campaign is looking forward to seeing the final results and is preparing for a lively general election in November.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the State Assembly seat of the 37th District started and ended with an unwavering  lead, held by lone Republican Charles Cole, who started off with 36.27% of the vote of the vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City Mayor Cathy Murillo followed with 22.44% of the vote, Steve Bennett with 16.82% and Jason Dominguez with 8.68%. Elsa Granados had 5.81% of the vote, Jonathan Abboud had 5.75% and Stephen Blum had 3.89%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all precincts reporting, Cole ended the night with 32.15% of the vote. Abboud, general manager of the Isla Vista Community Services District and longtime resident of I.V., fell behind with 6.89% of the semi-final vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re proud of our campaign staff and volunteers and supporters for running a really strong campaign,” Abboud said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we probably did not make the runoff, I’m not going to stop advocating for and working on the issues I ran on, that no other candidate did, like tuition-free public college, the Green New Deal to combat climate change and inequality and affordable housing … The campaign was always about the issues that were not being talked about, not about me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann supported Abboud’s campaign and echoed his sentiments for future plans. “Working with communities to identify their goals and then developing strategies to accomplish those goals. So for I.V. maybe a Green New Deal, you know, how do we bring that about?” Hartmann said. “How do we clearly get better quality housing in I.V. and get the university to build the housing?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the race for State Senator of the 19th District, Democrat Monique Limón and Republican Gary Michaels advanced to a runoff in the November general election, with 56.4% and 38.09% of the vote, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in the race for House Representative of the 24th District, Democrat Salud Carbajal and Republican Andy Caldwell will also advance to a runoff. Carbajal obtained 52.16% of the vote and Caldwell received 44.11%.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [3/5/2020 11:12 a.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Burciaga as Porter’s campaign manager.
