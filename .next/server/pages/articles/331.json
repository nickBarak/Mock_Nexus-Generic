Since then, Santa Barbara has swept teams such as Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside, and upcoming opponent UC Davis during this tenured win streak.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there were a lot of people that believed when we were 3-5 we’d move back to the upper echelon of the league,” UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Our team has definitely responded well [following this start].”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this essence of hot streaks towards the end of the season is nothing new for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos ended Big West play last year on a five-game winning streak finishing against notable teams such as then first seeded UC Davis, third seeded UC Irvine, and fifth seeded Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Despite ending this season on such a good note, Santa Barbara does face some challenges when matching up against UC Davis. The Aggies host some offensive threats in Neal Monson, Josh Fox, and Darius Graham.</p>\n<p>Although not as effective in the Aggies’ two losses to UCSB during the regular season, Monson has been relatively efficient as of late, averaging 16.5 points in the past two games. In his third year at UCD, Monson is coming off a career night last Saturday against Cal State Northridge in which he registered his third double-double of the season with 21 points and 15 rebounds. These were both team-highs as Monson helped propel the Aggies in their 87-83 triple overtime win on the road.</p>\n<p>The duo of Fox and Graham will also be key for the Aggies against Santa Barbara. Fox, this year’s All-Big West Second Team honoree, has been a reliable scorer for Davis. The senior forward has proven to be dangerous down low scoring 20 or more points on six occasions this year as well as tallying double-figures in scoring in 21 games this season.</p>\n<p>Fox recorded 17 points in his last outing against Santa Barbara, going 8-15 from the floor along with seven rebounds. His ability to maneuver his way into the paint and take quality shots can be attributed to his versatile scoring capabilities as he ranked sixth in the conference with a 51.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe will have their hands full containing both Fox and Monson in the frontcourt as they will attempt to deny the Aggies’ interior attack and hope to limit Davis from scoring easy points in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior Darius Graham is another central component to Davis’ unit. Awarded this year’s Big West Hustle Player of Year, it is Graham’s tenacious effort at both ends of the court that makes him a vital piece to the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>While Graham is only one of three Aggies who averages double figures in points, alongside Fox and junior guard Brynton Lemar, it is his motor and willingness to scrap for loose balls that sets him apart from the rest.</p>\n<p>Aside from Graham’s gritty demeanor on the floor, the third year player has proven to be a threat from beyond the arc. In his last two games against the Gauchos, Graham has hit 6-10 shots from behind the three-point line including a 3-4 performance from downtown in the Aggies’ 72-66 home loss to UCSB on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Williams will rely on the shooting core of Michael Bryson, Gabe Vincent, and John Green to propel his team to victory.</p>\n<p>The three have been the most consistent for UCSB, averaging more than half of the team’s points— scoring 42.7 of the Gauchos’ 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>After missing six games this season due to a knee injury, three of which were during conference play, the redshirt senior is coming along nicely. Green is shooting an efficient 53 percent from the field during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</p>\n<p>“[John] has had great support around him,” Williams said. “He is a very strong man and drives through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.”</p>\n<p>Green has scored in double figures five times during the team’s current eight-game winning streak, including a team-high 14 points to go along with 10 rebounds on senior night in the Gauchos’ 69-50 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“[We’re playing] with more discipline, but at the same time just having more fun,” Green said. “We’ve been trusting each other more. I’ve always said that it’s not what matters in the beginning of the year it’s what matters in early February and late March. It’s really clicking for us right now during the best time of the year.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff between UCSB and UCD is set for 12 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. The Quarterfinal matchup between Santa Barbara and Davis will air on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/","id":331,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[330,329,328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Advance, Face No. 4 Seed UC Davis Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_6-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A 62-43 first round victory over UC Irvine Tuesday night handed the UCSB women's basketball team its first postseaosn victory since the 2012-13 season.

The seven-point lead would go on to be the Anteaters’ largest of the game. Staying active for Irvine in the opening period was junior forward Mckenzie Piper with four of her eight points and five of her eight rebounds occurring during the period.</p>\n<p>However, Irvine was held scoreless for the remaining 5:37 of first quarter as UCSB went on a 5-0 run to close out the quarter with a tied score of 12-12.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to begin the second quarter with the first point of the period being at the 6:49 mark from a made free-throw by UCSB freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Newton managed to provide some offense in the paint with six points in the quarter but was matched in points by UCI junior guard Irene Chavez. The Anteaters’ leading scorer with 11 points, Chavez scored six of Irvine’s 10 points in the quarter but could not prevent UCSB from entering halftime with a 25-22 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes and two ties occurred during the third quarter. Tied 34-34, a layup by sophomore guard Makala Roper handed UCSB a 36-34 lead heading into the game’s final period.</p>\n<p>While the Anteaters recorded their best shooting percentage of 38.5 percent in the third quarter, they faltered in the fourth with a 15.8 field goal percentage to end the game.</p>\n<p>As UCI was plagued by its shooting woes, UCSB registered its best shooting performance of the game with a 52.6 shooting percentage in the final quarter. At the helm of the Gauchos’ late surge was Ware with 10 points to help lead UCSB to its 62-43 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to punch its ticket to Anaheim tonight with a matchup against No. 4 seeded UC Davis at 8:30 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Sophomore guard Makala Roper led UCSB in scoring with 20 points on 7-18 shooting overall and 3-8 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UC Davis advances to the Semifinals and will face Big West Conference regular season champion UC Riverside this Friday at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos recorded a season-low nine turnovers and matched Davis in field goals made at 24, their 11 extra shot attempts did not benefit them as their 38.7 field goal percentage was surpassed by the Aggies’ 47.1 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>In her postseason debut, redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch led the Aggies’ efficient shooting with a career-high 26 points on 11-16 shooting, tying her career best in field goals made. Her career-high in scoring is the most in a Big West Tournament game by a UC Davis player.</p>\n<p>Bertsch’s career night started early as she scored five points in the Aggies’ 11-4 run to open the game, forcing UCSB to call a timeout. She went on to finish the quarter with nine points while shooting a perfect 4-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Unable to contain the Aggies’ offense, UCSB’s issues continued on the offensive end as well. Able to only score in spurts, the Gauchos concluded the period down 10-20 after a 4-16 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Despite its shooting woes to begin the game, Santa Barbara improved in the second quarter shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from behind the three-point line, and 100 percent at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>An 8-3 scoring run to begin the second period helped UCSB to trim Davis’ lead to five at 18-23. But the Aggies regained their double figure lead after a made three-pointer by sophomore forward Pele Gianotti. Finishing tied with senior forward Celia Marfone for second in scoring at 15 points apiece, Gianotti went 4-9 shooting the ball and was 2-5 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Trailing by 12, Santa Barbara prevented Davis from extending its lead with an 8-2 run prior to entering halftime. Back-to-back three-pointers by senior guard Dioseline Lopez and Roper in the remaining 2:09 of the second quarter cut the Aggies’ lead to 34-28. Topping off the Gauchos’ run was sophomore forward Taylor Farris with a layup as UCSB entered the half trailing 30-36.</p>\n<p>Through the first three minutes of the second half, Santa Barbara extended its scoring stretch to a 14-5 run.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge in the third quarter was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and freshman guard Coco Miller with a combined total of 13 points on 4-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>With its lead only at three, UC Davis responded with a 7-0 run of its own to recapture another 10-point lead at 46-36 to force a Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB answered with a 13-4 run to close out the third quarter, capturing its first lead of the game at 49-48 after a made free-throw by Jemerigbe. But the Gauchos’ lead would only last for six seconds as Davis’ sophomore guard Rachel Nagel made a jumpshot to give the Aggies a 50-49 lead before starting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>While it was a strong ending for UCSB in the game’s final period, shooting 46.7 percent from the field in addition to eight points by Roper, Davis’ scoring arsenal of Bertsch, Gianotti, and Marfone was nearly unguardable.</p>\n<p>The trio scored 19 of the Aggies’ 21 points in the quarter, shot 7-10 from the field, and 2-2 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>A total of seven lead changes occurred in the final 10 minutes of Wednesday’s game. With 1:50 remaining in regulation, a three-pointer by Marfone increased the Aggies’ lead to four to 68-64.</p>\n<p>After calling a timeout, the Gauchos’ top three-pointer shooter in Roper responded with a clutch three of her own to reduce UC Davis’ lead to 68-67.</p>\n<p>Similar to Santa Barbara putting the ball into the hands of its best player, the Aggies did the same in getting the ball to Bertsch in the paint.</p>\n<p>In spite of the play call not succeeding and UCSB gaining possession, UC Davis’ defense managed to hold its ground forcing a turnover with the shot-clock violation to lead itself to victory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/71-67-loss-to-uc-davis-ends-season-for-ucsb/","id":329,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[328,327,326],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Season Ended in 88-76 Loss to Hawaii in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a historic ending to the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team saw its nine-game winning streak come to an end in its 88-76 loss to Hawaii Friday night in the Big West Conference Tourna...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a team-high 22 points from senior Michael Bryson, a 24-3 run opening the second half helped the University of Hawaii to defeat the UCSB men’s basketball team by a final score of 88-76 in the Semifinals Round of the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68937\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68937\" data-attachment-id=\"68937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/michael-bryson-pushes-the-ball-to-his-teammate-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Michael Bryson pushes the ball to his teammate.

The Gauchos end their year with an overall record of 18-13 and 11-5 in the Big West. The Rainbow Warriors improved to 26-5, advancing to the Big West Championship where they will face third seeded Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>It was a quick start for Hawaii, grabbing the lead early behind the play of center Stefan Jankovic. The newly crowned Big West Player of the Year connected on four of his first five shots, including two early threes, which handed Hawaii a 14-9 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Mizzou-transfer finished with 24 in points and seven rebounds in 31 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Warriors managed to extend their lead to 10 points as senior Aaron Valdez scored six straight points starting with a dunk assisted by forward Sai Tummala with 8:47 to go in the first. The third-year guard tallied his third double-double of the season finishing with 19 points and ten boards. This was also Valdez’s third straight game with 18 points or more.</p>\n<p>Following a 27-17 outpour by Hawaii, Santa Barbara responded with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>Guard Gabe Vincent helped turn things around scoring seven points in the final four minutes of the first period. The sophomore answered a Jankovich three with a make form beyond the arc, helping trim UCSB’s deficit to one at 30-29.</p>\n<p>Vincent then took a strong drive to the rim and gave the Gauchos their first lead since the 15 minute mark of the game at 31-30. The Stockton, CA native shot 46.7 percent from the floor for 17 points. Santa Barbara finished 9-2 in conference play when Vincent shoots above 40 percent, both losses coming to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>While UCSB only trailed by three heading into the break, the Gauchos were unable to halt Hawaii’s 21-3 run ignited by senior guard Roderick Bobbitt.</p>\n<p>Connecting on three straight three-pointers to open up the second half, Bobbitt scored 12 of his total 21 points in the final 20 minutes of play helping Hawaii maintain its lead. The Oakland point guard contributed distributing the ball as well tallying four of his five assists in the second period and grabbing at total of six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A big margin of difference lied in Hawaii’s field goal percentage and trips to the line. The Warriors shot 52 percent from the floor as well as hitting 27-37 free throws. Santa Barbara, a team who has shown consistency at the line, finished 16-27 from the free throw line. The Gauchos also took 10 more shots than Hawaii, going 26-60 from the floor, but finished with 43.3 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Alex Hart gave a much needed boost off the bench for UCSB. The sophomore forward finished with a career-high 13 points, shooting a perfect 3-3 from three-point range. Eric Childress also played a role on the defensive end. The junior guard finished with a career-high six steals, four of which came in the first half including three-straight steals with six minutes to go.</p>\n<p>However, the efforts of both players would not be enough to prevent the Rainbow Warriors from securing their 88-76 victory. Hawaii will attempt to win the conference championship in hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2002.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/","id":330,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[329,328,327],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
