Bike Shop began its operations in 1974, working out of two corrugated steel shipping containers. The original facility had no running water or electricity, and structural decay posed threats to staff members and patrons, the report stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current building was created in 2008 to replace the shipping containers, adding plumbing and electricity and addressing the most shop’s critical needs. But what was meant to be a temporary solution has now been in place for over a decade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building’s downfalls are especially felt during the beginning of fall quarter, senior mechanic and fourth-year earth science major Estefania Franco said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have tons of supplies and especially when it comes to fall quarter, we get extremely busy and it’s kind of hard to help others in maintaining their bikes because we can’t house that many bikes here, which we do in case people don’t have time to stay with us until their repair gets done or if it’s a little bit [of a] longer repair,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The community keeps growing, but the shop stays in this constant space that doesn’t allow us to help out the growing community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current attempt to find a permanent space for the bike shop is not the first. Previous A.S. presidents have incorporated plans for the space into redesigns of the University Center (UCen). Most recently, in spring 2018, President Hieu Le introduced a ballot measure to pay for the UCen redesign that would include a dedicated space for the bike shop, but when students voted not to move forward with renovations, the bike shop plans fell through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until A.S. President Brooke Kopel, who served during the 2018-2019 academic year, took office that plans moved forward for a bike shop entirely separate from any other designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel met last year with Mark Nocciolo, director of the Office of Budget and Planning, to discuss designs and locations. Nocciolo and Kopel intended to submit plans for the bike shop during spring of last year but were unable to when the last two campus planning committee meetings of the 2018-2019 year were cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project has since moved forward into the current year, with current A.S. President Alison taking over for Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They both have that sort of real conviction to get this done,” Nocciolo said. “And we’re doing all we can to make that happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campus Planning Committee approved plans to move forward with the bike shop during its Oct. 30 meeting and now plans to hire an architect to move forward with design and location plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee for the bike shop’s permanent location is a collaboration with Sir, Nocciolo, others in the Campus Planning Committee, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and employees at the bike shop. The committee created a list of space needs for the building and new location, including bike path accessibility, a garage door, a safer location for test riders than the current parking lot, increased indoor space and bike-specific storage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Campus Planning Committee has opened the search to 11 sites, which may increase when an architect is hired, the bike shop identified four locations they would prefer: by the Thunderdome, by the Student Affairs Building, by the UCSB bus loop and in the Old Gymnasium Building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of these four, Franco expressed that the Thunderdome is the preferred location of bike shop employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It already has some good plumbing and electricity situations, which would make it really ideal, especially because since it is on campus, it would make a really easy kind of for everyone since it belongs to the school,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the bike shop supports the Thunderdome location, Nocciolo has purposefully kept the location list open instead of recommending one for the Campus Planning Committee at this stage in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our project proposal, we included all the sites that we looked at, and we did that so that the committee would recognize that this is a process that is going to have more than one set of eyes looking at it. We felt as if it made more sense for the committee to see the array of possible sites rather than saying it’s this site or that site or this other site,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Nocciolo saw the immediate importance of a permanent shop location, he believes architects and the Campus Planning Committee must take into account the long-term growth of the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are instrumental in this activity; we will definitely want to have a committee involved, and students are always a part of these things. Student funds — they need to have a say. But we also need to have our eye on the long-term interests of the institution. We have a long range development plan that is going to live beyond us,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want it to be in a place that makes sense for the long term so that it is indeed permanent and that we’re not asking to have it moved again. We don’t want to forego any future development that would be really important to the academic program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also currently discussing master circulation of pathways, sidewalks, bike paths and roadways, according to the report, so Nocciolo doesn’t want any current bike shop plans to get in the way of other development projects in the works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that an architect has been hired, Nocciolo says it is a “realistic goal” to have the project approved by the Campus Planning Committee by the end of the academic year, so construction can commence during the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For bike shop employees like Franco, the change can’t come soon enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bike shop should grow as the community of biking grows. We see more and more students come in with bikes every year, but [our current location] is slowly limiting the amount of people we are able to help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

At the time, however, we were so keen on the act of registering students to vote that it’s possible we overlooked the importance of the next step: strictly nonpartisan voter education,” Winnett said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know Campus Dems and College Republicans, as well as CALPIRG, helped out tremendously with distributing materials to the student body at large, and I’m thrilled that there will now be another outlet through which students can find reliable information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has been a leader in student voter registration for decades because students have crafted a culture of civic engagement that is second to none,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited to see the passage of AB 963 because I see it as a step towards taking the model for voter registration that we have at UCSB statewide.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-11/gov-newsom-signs-bill-encouraging-voter-turnout-education-into-law/","id":3512,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[3511,3510,3509],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Seek Peaceful Solutions","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Oren Ofer and Timna Medovoy both carry dual citizenship to the United States and Israel.

Strauss Foundation, a program that funds public service projects, in hopes of starting such an organization on campus. After learning about the OTI’s similar goals through a student leader summit on the issue, Ofer and fellow Gaucho Saleh Abdulla — at the time the co-president of the Muslim Student Association — helped bring OTI to the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“When we presented our initial idea around the university, our kind of thing was: an ex-Israeli Defense Force soldier and a Yemeni Muslim … and co-president of the Muslim Student Association are trying to work together to bring this incredible experience to other UCSB students and to the UCSB community,” Ofer said.</p>\n<p>According to Ofer, OTI stepped in to provide a “middle ground” between some of the viewpoints on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want the conflict to be perpetuated on our campus,” Ofer said. “There’s enough conflict going around and as students, we are going to be making the policy in the future … It is really important that we are educated on these issues so we can make positive influences when we are in those positions.”</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2010, Ofer and fellow UCSB student Omer Harari traveled with OTI to the Middle East. Last summer, Co-Presidents Atapour and Medovoy, together with Mousa and graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, doubled the previous number of UCSB delegates to the Olive Tree Initiative and are currently active in the growing organization on campus.</p>\n<p><em>This is the second of three installments of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

In addition to those seven students, 12 other students were expected to study abroad in Hong Kong in the spring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said there were originally 90 students scheduled to go to Hong Kong in the fall, but after UCEAP offered them the option to switch programs or postpone their studies abroad due to the protests, 11 students chose to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been monitoring the situation since the summer,” Nyitray said. “So this wasn’t a decision that was either made lightly or out of any kind of haste or panic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the protests again continued to escalate further, and the response has been so unexpectedly strong from the police, with people being shot at with live ammunition, we felt that we really needed to evaluate this very, very carefully,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said the program’s first priority was ensuring the safety of UC students who are currently in Hong Kong, all of whom are attending one of three schools: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two out of our three partners [University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong] are now actually sites of protests and violence, and the faculty and staff are having difficulty getting to campus if they live at any distance because of the transit systems being shut down,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Wednesday that police in Hong Kong had begun “raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, police officers and students clashed near the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong; “police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows,” according to the Times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said that while it hasn’t reached the point where UCEAP will “actively evacuate” students currently in Hong Kong, students have been given the option to end their programs early and return home. UCEAP and its partner universities in Hong Kong have been working with students to ensure they will receive course credit for their terms, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She explained that as the protests escalated, there were “a number of [non-UC universities] who didn’t send students this fall at all,” while others have now “pulled [students] back and have simply told them ‘you must come back now.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because the UCEAP program is unusual in that it has such a large number of students, “we really wanted to not just jump in, we wanted to really assess the situation and give the students optimal chance to remain, to have the academic experience that they wanted to have, before we pulled out,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also added that if students were sent to Hong Kong in the spring and had to be evacuated, they might not be able to receive credit for the classes they were taking or be able to enroll in time at their home campuses for the quarter or semester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to balance the academic and the financial consequences for the students, you know, we don’t want any of the students to suffer at all,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP has not determined if they will suspend the Hong Kong summer abroad programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just so unclear — it’s unclear to our partners, it’s unclear to us,” Nyitray said. “We’ve been monitoring the State Department updates every day, and we have been monitoring local news, not only the foreign news, but local news, and of course we have our partners on the ground.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray noted that the State Department security level for Hong Kong is level two, or “exercise increased caution,” which she said was the same security level as most of Western Europe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the violence and the protests having moved to the campuses themselves, we feel that the situation warranted extra caution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
