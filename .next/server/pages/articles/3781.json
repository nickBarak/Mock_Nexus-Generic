His 22-page criminal history includes seven convictions for theft related offenses, including four cases of petty theft with a prior offense. All seven offenses involved time in custody and two were prison commitments.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies stopped a car because the occupants were not wearing their seatbelts while driving. During a consent search of the vehicle, deputies discovered hashish and a Vicodin pill in the car and a used hypodermic needle in the passenger’s pocket. The passenger is a self-admitted heroin addict and the driver, who was arrested for possession of the illegal substances, was on an “own recognizance release,” a written promise to appear at all court hearings, and on probation for burglary. Both were also charged with being under the influence of illegal substances.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday night, a subject threw themselves from the second story of their apartment building on the 800 block of Camino Lindo in an attempt to commit suicide. The subject, a UCSB student, was transported to a hospital and remains there in stable condition.</p>\n<p>According to law enforcement, Saturday night was relatively quiet, which officers credit to the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival which draws many students out of town for the weekend.</p>\n<p>However, law enforcement dealt with another suicide scare this Saturday. IVFP received a call from a friend of the subject. The reporting party called from Ventura, stating that her friend, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student, was reportedly in the I.V. area and was distraught. The caller reported the friend having said, “I am going to take the ultimate sleep,” after which she immediately telephoned law enforcement. Deputies were dispatched to check the local beaches, ultimately unsuccessfully and an attempt was made to locate the subject’s iPhone. Shortly after, a GPS located the phone in Los Alamos. Further investigation found that the subject lived in Nipomo and, according to the caller, could have possibly been driving home. The subject’s parents were contacted and some 30 minutes later the subject arrived home. The parents stated their son seemed fine and were advised to call 9-1-1 if they suspected he needed any mental health or emergency assistance.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, a student called to report his girlfriend had said she was going to kill herself. After confirming that threat was potentially plausible, units responded to her residence at 6600 block of Trigo to check on her welfare. However, they were unable to make contact, even after entry was made through an unsecured door. Further investigation and GPS cell phone locating revealed the woman was in the area of Veronica Springs Road near Elings Park in Santa Barbara, where one of her friends lives, according to the caller. Responding officers requested Goleta units check the area, along with the last known location of the phone; they were also provided with the subject’s vehicle description. All searches yielded negative results.</p>\n<p>Later on Sunday, a student called to say she and her sister received prank phone calls within an hour of each other. The student said her call was a partially pre-recorded computer voice intermixed with a live caller that was antagonistic. When she told the caller she was bored and was going to hang up, the caller became angry and cursed at her, calling her by name.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, the sister of the student said she was not threatened at all by the call and hung up after just a few seconds. It is suspected that the calls were related but no solid suspect could be determined and an investigation is ongoing.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ivpf-reports-suicide-attempts-theft-prank-calls/","id":3781,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3780,3779,3778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian","biography":"Not available","articles":[2931,2947,2960,3459,3760,3773,3778,3779,3780,3781,3782,3784,3936,3937,3938,3940,3941,3942,4622,4747,4772,4783,4790,4796],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter Feb. 9-17","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Law enforcement responded to numerous calls in Isla Vista last week regarding prowling, theft, public intoxication and animal mistreatment, among other crimes.</p>\n<p>On Monday, law enforcement confronted a female SBCC student outside I.V. Market after she stole a bottle of tequila. Deputies arrested the suspect for theft and minor in possession. Later on Monday, deputies responded to reported gunshots at Ocean Meadows golf course. I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and Goleta Sheriff’s units responded and established a perimeter around the course and an air unit was deployed. Further investigation of the incident determined reports to be unfounded.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, IVFP units responded to an anonymous call about animal mistreatment taking place in I.V. Authorities identified and requested to search April Stewart’s vehicle to check the welfare of her dogs and found she was in possession of a used hypodermic needle and a glass pipe commonly used to smoke methamphetamine. According to the IVFP, residue left in the pipe indicated recent use. Stewart’s animals were also found to be not properly cared for and Stewart was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, violation of probation and cruelty to animals.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies subdued a man refusing to pay a cab driver on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect, later identified as Darris Cotton, was seen evading the cab driver and attempting to flee. Deputies were able to contact Cotton, who the cab driver wanted to have arrested for petty theft for failure to pay. After deputies conducted a records check on Cotton, it was discovered he was on parole for robbery and was subsequently arrested for violation of parole.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP stopped SBCC student Jose De Alba, who was walking down the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde carrying a laptop. When confronted, De Alba’s story contained conflicting evidence and upon further investigation deputies found the had just committed a residential burglary, though officials declined to state where the burglary occurred. The laptop was returned and De Alba was arrested.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, a male subject was reported to be “prowling,” lurking in an area intending to commit a crime, in a backyard on the 6700 block of Pasado. The property resident was able to provide a detailed description of the suspect who was later identified and arrested in an in-field lineup.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, IVFP recorded nine arrests and 12 citations. On the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, a male subject was observed walking in a small group being extremely loud. The subject was trying to high five passersbys and was determined to be causing a disturbance with the potential to cause a fight. The male and his friends began to flee once they saw law enforcement approaching. Subjects fled for about two blocks but were apprehended at International Food Market. The original male was located in the back parking lot of the store, out of breath and urinating on himself. He was charged for public intoxication, fleeing law enforcement and urinating in public.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, deputies recorded three arrests and six citations. On Sunday night, Pizza My Heart employees reported a female who had been at the restaurant drinking all day. She left and returned later, more intoxicated than she had been when she left. She was socializing with restaurant patrons and then began to pass out on a table. Alone and unable to care for her own safety, she was arrested for public intoxication. Later, Garden Court Security reported an intoxicated male in the courtyard area causing a disturbance. He fled the complex, but was located at 880 Camino del Sur and arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Finally, at approximately 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday the 17th, deputies responded to a call of a subject who appeared to be injured within a vehicle in the parking lot of Goleta Beach.  Upon arrival, it was discovered that the male victim was killed by an apparent gunshot wound.  The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is investigating, but law enforcement reports that at this point no foul play is suspected.   No further information will be released until the victim’s next-of-kin has been notified.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/police-blotter-feb-9-17/","id":3778,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3777,3776,3775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 24-26","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to a fight, a bicycle theft and an attempted robbery last weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) responded to a fight, a bicycle theft and an attempted robbery last weekend.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, dispatch responded to a call reporting a fight on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive. IVFP deputies and UCPD officers were informed one combatant likely had a weapon and another may have been thrown off of a balcony. The two male subjects fled the scene as officers arrived. An IVFP deputy caught one suspect, Omar Flores, who had a large laceration to his left arm. The other suspect described as a black adult male wearing shorts and no shirt escaped. IVFP conducted an in-field lineup, and witnesses identified Flores as a combatant in the fight. Deputies transported Flores to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for treatment of his arm.</p>\n<p>Later on Thursday night, witnesses reported seeing the other escaped subject enter an apartment near the scene of the fight. Deputies searched the apartment with consent from the residents and found suspect Darris Lee Cotton hiding in a back room. In another in-field lineup, a witness identified Cotton as the second combatant. Cotton reportedly hit Flores in the head repeatedly with a broomstick, causing injury. Deputies arrested Cotton and transported him to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for possible alcohol poisoning. Both Flores and Cotton were later transported to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning, an I.V. resident entered the IVFP station just before 7 a.m. to report suspicious activity from two subjects entering backyards on Del Playa Drive and possibly stealing bicycles. Deputies found suspects 21-year-old Jack Vanantwerp and 18-year-old Dillinger Douglas with two bicycles at 7-Eleven on Trigo Road. The suspects admitted to stealing the bicycles and were brought into custody by deputies. The bicycles did not match any reports.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, deputies found SBCC students Joshua Powell and Keaton Jensen attempting to enter an apartment through a window. An investigation followed and deputies determined Powell and Jensen had no reason to enter the apartment. Both subjects were arrested and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-28/weekend-wrap-up-april-24-26/","id":3779,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3778,3777,3776],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up Feb. 27 to March 1","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Law enforcement officers with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and University of California Police Department (UCPD) responded to numerous calls this past week on various incidents concerning a fight...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Law enforcement officers with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and University of California Police Department (UCPD) responded to numerous calls this past week on various incidents concerning a fight, drug seizure and vandalism.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, deputies responded to an anonymous report of a suspicious white male adult, described as bald with full sleeve tattoos on both arms, near the Korean United Methodist Church on Camino del Sur. Deputies searched the area and located the subject, who provided false identification as James “Parilo.” The name “Parilo” was not found during a records check, despite several attempts to locate a match. The subject continued to provide the name “Parilo” and a false date of birth, until a California identification card was located in his wallet and he was identified as James Parillo. Parillo had an active warrant out for his arrest in Georgia and chose not to be extradited. He was ultimately arrested for providing a false identification and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, a large swastika was found scratched into the hood of a black Lexus in a carport at 6500 Cordoba. Law enforcement determined the vandalism had no apparent target, as the victim said she did not have disputes with anyone and is not Jewish.</p>\n<p>During the Friday day shift, IVFP deputies responded to ongoing complaints from the Isla Vista Elementary School staff concerning vehicles parked illegally in front of the school. The staff reported that the illegally parked vehicles were obstructing parents’ vehicles as they dropped off and picked up their children from school and that it constituted safety hazard because it forced students to walk in the middle of the roadway to get to school. IVFP deputies issued 28 parking citations and 16 warnings that gave the vehicle owners 72 hours to move their cars.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded 21 physical, 17 adult and 4 juvenile arrests and issued dozens of citations. On the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde, deputies arrested four students during a fight involving more than eight people using fists and a broken cane. The subjects resisted arrest and had to be subdued with impact weapons. La Jolla High School student Jake Rosenthal, his brother and UCSB student Bryce Rosenthal and Santa Barbara City College student Mason Rutherford were treated by American Medical Response on scene and booked into county jail. The juvenile who started the fight was visiting I.V. from San Diego with the Rosenthal brothers and was booked into Santa Maria Juvenile Hall for providing a false identification.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday, deputies found Garrett Kosloff in his vehicle snorting a line of Xanax on the 6700 block of Trigo Road. He was also in possession of a half-pound of marijuana that he admitted to selling to his friends. Kosloff was arrested and booked into county jail. Deputies also found students in possession of marijuana and alcohol when they responded to a noise complaint concerning a property on the 6600 block of El Colegio. Upon searching the property, deputies found underage female students from the English First (EF) language school in Santa Barbara, drinking alcohol. The party hosts, EF student Armendariz Izquierda and UCSB student Luis Ortiz, were arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors. The EF students were released from the IVFP station to EF staff.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 12 citations. On Sunday, IVFP units assisted the UCPD with an area search near Phelps Road and Cannon Green Drive, after a report of multiple females screaming in the area. Units searched westbound on foot along the bluffs and ended up at Ellwood Elementary, but made no discoveries.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/weekend-wrap-up-feb-27-to-march-1/","id":3780,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3779,3778,3777],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
