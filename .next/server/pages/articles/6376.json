Today our topic is one of much excitement: kinky sex. But before we get there we must take a peek into my past, so you can understand how I have suffered for this cause. Now, please understand when going into this story that the spirit of it all was admirable. The carrying out was less so. This article will offer suggestions that, had my partner been aware of such things, may have lessened my plight. That’s right; it’s time for another awkward sexual anecdote.</p>\n<p>It was summer 2012. My small tank of a friend had persuaded me to drink copious amounts of alcohol before taking me to a frat party. Shortly after arriving, I found a companion for the evening and we made it over to his place. Both fairly tipsy, he was a tad rough, not in the delightful way I will be encouraging, but in the, “Ow, ow, softer dumbass,” way. This is where things went terribly wrong. Like a good partner, he was terribly eager to go south, and that’s when I opened my big dumb mouth. “Bite my thigh,” I foolishly uttered. Grinning saucily up at me, he did as he was told. However, when I said bite, I meant really more of a nip, something soft and inspiring. What I got was a bruise that lasted three weeks. It looked like someone had shot a baseball at my thigh at a whopping 60 mph. For days I could not fathom how it got there, I was too consumed with agitation at the eight hickies he had dispatched across my neck. The moment of realization was characterized by sheer horror: Yes, those were teeth indents. The moral of this story is thus: A) a number of my sexual situations are uncomfortable and weird and B) bite others as you would like to be bitten. Now, to be sure, I am happy he bit me. I wish he hadn’t bit me like he was making an appearance in Shark Week, but I appreciate his willingness to adventure. And that is what characterizes much of the kink.</p>\n<p>As unabashed as I am in ranting about my junk and sexual prowess to you nice people, I too occasionally remain mum on my desire for hair pulling, ass smacking and mouth covering. When I was hooking up with a BDSM dom (bondage, dominance, sadism, masochism) back in fall quarter, I felt I was finally getting an outlet for all the wild things I really wanted to do. It was the most fun I’ve ever had in bed, hands down, because it was so fresh and bad and shameful that it made sex new and shiny all over again. When did sex become so routine? Shouldn’t you blush just a tad when you think of the things you did? At this point it’s become, “Oh yeah, we hooked up, had sex, whatevs.” For shame! I want to see girls whispering behind their hands into their friends’ ears about the wild and crazy things they’ve done in the dark.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now, a lot of people are freaked out by the idea of kinky sex. You can imagine why. Their mind goes to the freaky German dungeon porn they came across when they clicked the wrong pop-up on the internet. But rest assured, there are ways to be kinky in your interactions without freaky torture machines.</p>\n<p>For those uncomfortable with kinky sex, that is just fine. This article may not apply to you. However, there is the chance that you might be with someone who digs some kink one night and you should have some awareness as to handle the situation. A big disappointment occurs when an individual actually asks to get kinkier, after summoning the courage, but their partner, unsure, half asses it. Fake it, guys, fake it. If your partner senses your inhibition or your lack of commitment, they become disappointed and may be discouraged to ask in the future. Additionally, don’t make them ask more than once. If they ask at all and you’re down at all, expect to include it in your sexual routine.</p>\n<p>Another important note for the unsure is this: Try everything once. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. Now you know. As a rule, try to keep open minded about everything until you can say for yourself that it does not appeal to you. Now that we have these things in mind, we can move on.</p>\n<p>First, let us visit the very important distinction of biting verses nipping. Nipping is applied to sensitive areas like nipples, earlobes, THIGHS. Biting is sometimes for necks, shoulders and less sensitive areas. Be aware of sensitivity prior your chomp fest. Perhaps the most important thing you can take away from my advice on bighting is to do unto others as you would have them do for you. Bite experimentally; start off light always. If they want it harder, they’ll ask and you can build up. Or if they are fairly quiet, maybe your partner is a bit less sensitive and you can take that as a cue.</p>\n<p>Aside from biting, there is the classic ass smack. Now, if you’re really going to smack someone’s ass, it is important to rub it out afterwards. You smack, and then rub your palm in circles in the afflicted area. This significantly lessens the pain and gives it more of a pleasurable edge. Plus, you get a good grope in.</p>\n<p>Scratching is also wonderful. My last partner looks like he was mauled by a pack of disgruntled cats. It’s the same with biting, start a little lightly to see if they like it. If they like the biting, you can be sure they like the scratching. Try not to rip off a layer of skin, if you can help it.</p>\n<p>Hair pulling should be done as close to the roots as possible, with a handful of hair, not a small section. This reduces the pain and instead causes a refreshing sensation. I have had my hair pulled improperly. Imagine if you will, yours truly seated upon a frat kitchen counter, with my head basically touching my back. Humans are not supposed to bend that way, or they would have named us Gumbies. The arc is nice, but please, do not break your partner’s neck.</p>\n<p>When it comes to choking, I, personally, am not a fan. I was making out with this guy and he started doing it and I stopped him. Confused, his response was thus, “Did you have an abusive boyfriend?” …to which I replied, “No, I just like breathing.” Simple as that. However, some girls are super hot for this. After discussing it with my associates, the key is not to suffocate her (dur), but instead to apply light pressure. Place your hand on her neck, and press slightly with the flat of your palm. Then minimally increase the pressure, if encouraged by your bedmate.</p>\n<p>Now, while I may personally dislike choking, mouth covering is another thing altogether. Some of us are louder than others. Roommates are often less than thrilled with our sexual presence. My favorite remedy to this conflict of interest is for a guy to muffle my cries with his palm. Gents, do this while whispering quietly in her ear, “shhh.” Continuing this tangent of covering, a good friend of mine goes crazy when you cover her eyes. It’s a simpler form of blindfolding and it really just gives that feeling of susceptibility.</p>\n<p>In terms of being tied up, oh yum. Now, it probably isn’t a good first hook up move to break out the silken ties or handcuffs. But, you can absolutely pin them down. This is unbelievably hot. Do that. It’s fun to squirm in your hold and it establishes your dominance which is something a lot of people fail to do. Sex is best in my opinion with a bit of a power struggle.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most kinkily, in my humble opinion is getting in your partner’s head. Saying things. Having them say things. Commanding them to do things. For those of you who have deigned to read my vibrator article, you may remember the anecdote of my partner informing me that I must petition him on whether or not I could come. This is a prime example. The best way to get someone in a submissive head state, I’ve come to believe, is to have them repeat a phrase over and over. Approximately three to five times. If done properly, it puts you in a trance like state. I shit you not. For instance, “What am I doing to you?” Fill in the blank, “What can I do to you?” To which you say breathily, “Whatever you want.” Repeat this sequence three or so times, preferably while pleasuring them so they are foggy headed and unquestioning of your bizarre inclination to repeat yourself.</p>\n<p>I will leave out other things for fear that they cannot be published. All in all, it is important to push your boundaries and try new things. You’ll never know unless you try. Undoubtedly, a lack of kink is the most lamented aspect of many individuals’ sex lives. That and an inkling as to where the clitoris is. So my darlings, break the bondage of standard sex and get a little spicy! Adios muchachos; hump most happily!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. knows how to keep a hose flowing, even when it’s kinked.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/","id":6376,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6375,6374,6373],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E.","biography":"Not available","articles":[6320,6325,6328,6347,6349,6351,6353,6356,6359,6361,6363,6368,6371,6372,6374,6376,6377,6381,6408],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sit Back, Open Your Mind and Spread Your Legs for the Sex Talk Your Parents Didn’t Give You","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hello my lovely new readers, I’m going to skip all of the intro nonsense and get right to it: This is the Wednesday Hump, so let’s talk about sex.

But let’s divest our talk of sex from the very emotional bits and the stigma that so often comes with it. For today, let’s just talk about the purely physical aspects of sex. Let’s talk about getting it on and feeling good with some other willing participant. I’m sure this is a topic most of us denizens of Isla Vista already feel perfectly comfortable with.</p>\n<p>People can get so hung up on preconceived notions when it comes to sex. We often find themselves being irrationally scared of sexualities that are outside the norm, especially when we think of ourselves participating in such sexual acts. Undoubtedly, most of my readers will identify as straight men or women, and that’s absolutely fine. Most of you, I’m sure, also legitimately find yourselves attracted to members of the opposite sex, and again that’s fine. Let me ask you though: have you ever given any real thought to your sexual experiences with your same sex compatriots? Again it’s safe to assume that the answer most of you will have given to that question is, “No.” My legitimate yet unanswerable question is, “Why?” What is it that we as a society have decided is so repulsive about two dudes (or ladies) helping each other out a bit, maybe getting to know each other a little better? And yes, I do mean in the biblical sense.</p>\n<p>Now all you painfully straight bro-types out there might be thinking, “Gross, dude I’d never let another guy slob my knob,” but I implore you, in the name of freethinking and getting personally acquainted with the human condition, let’s keep our minds open here, alright bro? After all, in the end the physical act of sex just amounts to stimulation of some very sensitive cells located in our nether regions and not much else. Cells don’t care about gender.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sex has been shown to mitigate the effects of aging, reduce stress levels, relieve depression symptoms and just feel damn good. Having sex can literally bring people together, because you don’t know someone quite as well as you could until you’ve made the beast with two backs with them, right? So how can something that has the potential to be such a wonderful bonding opportunity between people have become so taboo in our society?</p>\n<p>I read a story the other day about a gay-identifying man and a straight-identifying man who are currently in a loving romantic relationship together. The sex isn’t great for them, and there are places that the straight man isn’t willing to go just yet, but he’s working on it because he knows that sex is sex, and as long as he’s sticking it where he wants, and the other party wants to get stuck, then everything is just fine. The straight man said that his aversion to sex with his partner is in his head, and eventually he’ll be ready for it. The comments section on this oddity of a tale was abysmally depressing.</p>\n<p>Scores of people told this individual that he was a “self-hating gay” and that he was “in denial about his own sexuality.” I think he is just a normal guy who found not only a best friend, but someone with whom he was comfortable enough with to open up in a way that the world at large might frown upon.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story, folks? Let’s stop looking at sex as a man and a woman bumping uglies and let’s start looking at it as two humans getting as physically close with each other as can be.

Today we will be pondering the complexities of girl-on-top. This entails subtopics such as where a male’s hands should be, the paramount importance of hip-guiding and the foolish insecurities of women. Let’s ride this topic out.</p>\n<p>Gentlemen, when it comes to girl-on-top, hand placement is a major factor in how well you will be graded. Your options are as follows: breasts, clit, hands or hips. Due to your prime real estate, you must take advantage of your free hands. Not using your hands is the equivalent of the “dead fish” female partner. Further elaborating upon the point of hips, hip-guiding falls into the realm of communication, and that’s important.</p>\n<p>When guiding the hips of a madam, you can control the speed, tempo and depth. Oftentimes girls assume that faster is better, but guys like going slow, too, so that they can better focus on the sensations building up. By guiding her, you can help her figure out just what you want. Many times girls might feel awkward because them controlling the motions are atypical, so more feedback makes them more comfortable with exploring this elevate realm. Plus, it’s freakin’ sexy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hombres, if there is anything you take from this article, let it be this: never, ever, ever put your hands behind your head. I’ve stopped and traded in my friction for some slanderous diction. Others will abandon your love boat completely, preferring the treacherous seas of abstinence. It may be comfortable, but it makes you look like a D-bag.</p>\n<p>Another much appreciated effort: when you grab a girl’s wrists in both hands and put them over your head. G’damn. And ladies, feel free to pin him as well when on top. Everyone loves a little power struggle. Your dominion over his titillating territory/provocative province (oh, how I love alliteration) can be emphasized by eye contact. Eye contact is particularly sexy when you initiate it atop your fleshy throne. Just as chimpanzees will challenge one another via the medium of a sullen stare, you too assert your sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel like eye contact is a good move in sexual relations. It always surprises me when people say that they dislike eye contact due to the intensity of the intimacy it generates. Allow me to remind you that sex is an intimate act and despite however emotionally casual your relationship with a partner may be, you shouldn’t shy away from the increased sexual tension. Eye contact is a universal acknowledgement of the other person’s existence. So acknowledge the eff out of their sexual existence. Ladies, when in reverse cowgirl, toss him a smokey gaze over your shoulder all sexy-like. Maybe gape like a fish, I think guys are actually into that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Speaking of reverse cowgirl, let’s talk about the scenic views of your grassy pastures. When in reverse, lean further towards his feet. It provides a deliciously vulgar view of him entering you that he will pause to appreciate. This is the best time to go nice and slow. If you lean even farther forward, he can sit up while propped against something. This variation provides good leverage, a delicious angle of your badonk sitting pretty on his lap.</p>\n<p>An additional variation that I’m very excited about (and you should all do this like it’s homework) is as follows: in reverse cowgirl, pull up one of his knees. Put your knees on either side and hold onto his knee to maneuver yourself up and down better. It’s especially yummy because you have friction on your privies from his thigh.</p>\n<p>Speaking of thighs, a problem a lot of women have is being insecure on top for superficial reasons, like the dimples on your thighs. Playa’ please, he’s not looking at the dimples. He’s focusing on your pretty face and ogling your bouncing bazoongas. That’s real talk.</p>\n<p>Finally, my darlings, end your copulation with what I like to call, “The Perfect Dismount.” This involves the man, once near, to toss his saucy lady off her seat, pouncing her hungrily and riding it out to the finish with fevered passion. Primal hunger should characterize the act. Wait, what am I saying? Primal hunger should characterize all parts of sex.</p>\n<p>Go, enjoy, frolic in each others bodies. Happy humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. knows a lady on top is what’s hot … and there ain’t no glass ceiling in her bedroom.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/queen-hill-tingling-tales-girlontop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/queen-hill-tingling-tales-girlontop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/queen-hill-tingling-tales-girlontop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/queen-hill-tingling-tales-girlontop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/queen-hill-tingling-tales-girlontop/","id":6374,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6373,6372,6371],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gay, Straight,Vanilla, Kinky, Polyamory, Femme, Butch: In the Palette of Sexual Tastes, Minorities Are Not One, But Many","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In my recent reflections, I have found myself considering society’s approach to sexual minorities.

From fetishism to transgender attraction to polyamorous behavior to non-heterosexuality, non-normative sexual behavior reflects perhaps most directly the twisting and fluid nature of the human subconscious —it is intertwined with our animal past, complicated by our cerebral evolution, and manifested in our daily lives. With this article I intend to analyze the spectrums by which these non-normal sexual behaviors are defined and draw a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, our society seems to have created several spectrums with which to quantify sexual preference. There is a spectrum along the sex line — whether one prefers a penis or vagina. Another spectrum exists along the gender line — this is harder to define, but slides from typically masculine behavioral traits to typically feminine behavioral traits. A third spectrum spans between what is considered “vanilla sex” and “kinky sex” — this covers a vast variety of possible “kinks,” but fundamentally hinges on the sex act itself. A fourth spectrum captures the idea of monoamory (literally ‘one love’) versus polyamory (literally ‘many loves’) — though this spectrum, perhaps, can be represented as a simple binary preference.</p>\n<p>So let us start by looking at the first spectrum, as it decides whether someone is gay or straight. The psychology behind this spectrum is incredibly convoluted by our society. It is entirely preferable to be heterosexual in this culture, but the fact homosexuals exist suggests that there is a large genetic component. But we define sexuality as a spectrum for a reason — many people hover in the middle of pure straight and pure gay, developing a preference over time and through experimentation. But in the end there is a distinct lack of control involved with where you end up. Some people are compelled to only find penises attractive, some people vaginas. And, of course, some are lucky enough to be able to fluidly shift between the two.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But if the sex preference is determined by factors beyond society’s means to control, the gender preference is almost a complete societal construction. By creating distinct images of what a man should be and what a woman should be, society can compel its population to find certain things attractive or unattractive. The root of the preference, however, is simple. One finds certain personality traits attractive, and based on how many of those traits are masculine or feminine, finds a place on this scale.</p>\n<p>The kink scale arises from a person’s preferences surrounding the sex act itself. Some people enjoy dominating others, while some enjoy being dominated. Others might find feet irresistible, or latex or furry animal costumes. Kink comes out of the deep places of the subconscious, and the number of fetishes are so diverse they escape analysis by simple means. And so to define where one lays on this spectrum, one must turn to the definition of normal. Again, what is “normal” sex and what is “kinky” sex is here defined by society. Thus, kink is a measure of how normative one’s preference in sexual activity is.</p>\n<p>And, finally, we have the binary of one single love versus many loves. This might arise from two places — the first is a throwback to patriarchal systems. This system can be observed in archaic Mormonism, where men were polygamists while women were monogamous (polygyny, in other words). The more contemporary version of polyamory seems to derive itself from the concepts of free love and, more generally, communalism. Men and women can possess multiple partners and all of it seems to be in the spirit of the freedom to love as many as one wants. Monoamory, on the other hand, promotes the idea of giving one’s all to a single, special person. It is individualistic and romantic and is the normalized model in our culture.</p>\n<p>Now, each of these scales possesses a societal majority side (heterosexual, cis-gender, vanilla sex, and monoamory) and each possesses a minority side. Interestingly, however, where one exists on each spectrum is not coupled to where one exists on the others. A heterosexual man could be kinky with his one very special butch female. A bisexual could have vanilla sex with her somewhat feminine male partner on Tuesdays and her caring female partner of Thursdays. Gays can settle down with one person or many. And the reason for this decoupling is the fundamental deterministic psychology behind each preference.</p>\n<p>The sex preference is a biological and social imperative about what a person has sex with.</p>\n<p>The gender spectrum is a personality-based preference about with whom a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The kink preference is about how a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The poly/monoamory is about how many people the person allocates emotion to.</p>\n<p>The behaviors do not arise from the same roots – they are independent preferences and come with independent desires. Interestingly, however, the sexual minorities from each group are often linked together in the social conscious and treated as a single, bulk community.</p>\n<p>Thus we reach the point I wanted to draw. It is dangerous to set equal these minorities in the social psychology, as they represent very different interests and very different goals. Each minority group deserves equality, but to treat a gay person as identical to a polyamorist or a fetishist as someone who is gender queer is an offensive simplification of sexual identity and sexual preference. Some gays want nothing more than to settle down with one true love, while others push for their polyamory to be accepted. Some fetishists enjoy the company of the same sex and others of the opposite.</p>\n<p>And so, it is my hope that our society might start to see the sexual minorities as individual communities, allied in their struggle for acceptance but not identical in their desires or differences. Each represents a different aspect of society’s relationship with sex, and each should be examined as its own unique identity.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous tops his scoop of vanilla with a dopple of kink-sauce.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/","id":6375,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6374,6373,6372],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
