In less than 24 hours, Ward’s event, which had received over 200,000 invitees, caught the attention of virtually every smartphone screen in the nation, the UK and Jimmy Kimmel’s writers.</p>\n<p>In an effort to convert this haphazard incursion of internet publicity into a more concrete career propellant, the flautist-turned-meme turned to fellow UCSB beatmaker Timmy Linetsky aka DJ Underbelly. Together, the duo created a dreamy Jazz-Hop mesh of ephemeral high-register flute runs with a cloudy synth bounce spine.</p>\n<p>When Azeem X Underbelly concluded the Batcave Session’s 2014-2015 season, they were about to embark on an unplanned tour of the United Kingdom, with the musicians serving as de facto booking agent and manager—an ambitious exploit for musicians who had previously performed neither duty. Well, they’re back. After a five week tour spanning across 12 cities all over Britain and Scotland, the pair has returned stateside to their UCSB alma mater to talk UK tour, future musical endeavors and returned to our chalk-wall cove to kick-off the first Batcave Session of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>Alex Bocknek: How many shows did you make on tour? How about ticket sales?</p>\n<p>Azeem Ward: We performed about 15-20 shows. And sometimes we had pop-up performances. [For tickets] somewhere, in the realm of 6,000 to 10,000.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: What were the general feel of your performances?</p>\n<p>AW: Some of our performances were in the realm of 1.5k.</p>\n<p>TL: The reception…well we found our sweet spot was with 300-500 people audiences where people were sort of gathered around us, where people still actually wanted to listen to the music, whereas, in the huge commercial shows, people just want to rage their faces off. If you place something that’s not Top-40 in those sets…you’re fucked. But, at the same time, it’s really fun to be able to command a crowd of that size.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: Were these the biggest shows you’ve played to date?</p>\n<p>TL: Well, I’ve played the Low End Theory Festival in LA this year. It was about 3 or 4 thousand.</p>\n<p>AW: 1,500 was the biggest I played to in the UK. But when I had my recital, we had 55,000 people logged into the livestream. The venue is actually only 100 seats, but we had people standing up. So, it was probably about 150 people there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: Where did you sleep and how did you get around?</p>\n<p>TL: Sometimes, we would get lucky and the venue would provide us with a combination. They would provide us with a really swanky hotel to stay in and we felt like rockstars, but for the most part we would just stay with students at their places. They would house us and feed us, and, yeah, they were all really awesome and nice. We met so many people.</p>\n<p>AW: We’d normally figure it out the day before. We’d require the venues, for about 85-90% gigs that they’d provide some sort of accommodation, and since a lot of the organizations were student-run, they couldn’t afford swanky hotels.</p>\n<p>TL: Sometimes, they had really nice beds that we each got. Sometimes, we’d have to share a bed. Sometimes, I’d make Azeem sleep on the floor, because I’m a bitch. You know, I’m a princess, so I want the bed. We got by.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: What’s your favorite story?</p>\n<p>AW: There was this one party I went to in St. Andrews. Getting there, they were calling me on Facebook, “Yo Azeem where you at?” “Tell me where your at so we can come get you.” We finally get there. It’s a super posh party. The moment I get there they just start screaming, “Azeem’s here! Azeem’s here!”</p>\n<p>TL: The moment we walked in they just started grabbing him like he’s Justin Bieber or some shit.</p>\n<p>AW: Like I don’t even know these people. They literally grab me and bring me into the kitchen. They had groups of people coming up to me. First, it was all of the boys. Then, it was all of the girls. They literally started arguing over who could take pictures with me.</p>\n<p>TL: Azeem is really nice and doesn’t turn down people who ask for selfies. At this one party in London, it was just really really bad. So what I did was every time a new person asked for a selfie, I would get in the picture and cover his face with my face so that they would get too frustrated and leave.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: How do you like your newfound stardom or do you prefer anonymity?</p>\n<p>AW: I like the stardom to a point where it’s like “hey I know about you and I want to know more about your life.” But what I got mostly was, “hey how was the recital?”</p>\n<p>TL: Or have you been to Cheeky Nandos. We went to nine Cheeky Nandos.</p>\n<p>AW: We had a lot of interviews in Nandos, as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: How do you like going from your massive celebrity in the UK to the more casual following in the States?</p>\n<p>AW: It’s nice. You have more time to do what you want to do and have to do. It’s a peace of mind sort of thing. A lot of artists take the time to record and prepare for something like that. Whereas, we didn’t really take the time to prepare a UK tour like we did.</p>\n<p>TL: Yeah, we didn’t have the time. We had to put it together really fast.</p>\n<p>AW: Super fast. It’s especially really unusual for an artist to not have any recorded music or anything like that, just going and tour somewhere.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AB: Last we spoke, Azeem was intending to go to Iowa for grad school. What does that mean for your collaboration?</p>\n<p>AW: It seems like our solo stuff is more important to us.</p>\n<p>TL: We’ve gone this far without anything recorded, so far. As a personal goal, I would really want a release for us. Because we didn’t tour behind an album, people only knew Azeem as a meme. So we were basically a novelty act. When we tried to push past top-40 and try to do something more musical and try not to be a novelty act, the promoter would tell us to get off stage.</p>\n<p>AW: At the rate we’re going…I don’t know. We have different aspirations, and, at the core, we have different musical tastes.</p>\n<p>Check out the Batcave Session here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9lfDuZjQfQg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfDuZjQfQg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66931\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-the-batcave/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66931\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-the-batcave/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-the-batcave/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-the-batcave/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-the-batcave/","id":6866,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6865,6864,6863],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[901,914,2145,2155,5849,6019,6661,6794,6801,6814,6834,6838,6857,6866,6879,6885,6906,6907,6911,6924,6929,6938,6942,6968,6969,6973,6987,7755,7758],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Azeem X Underbelly Return to Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Walking into the dimly lit room at SOhO in downtown Santa Barbara Thursday night was a bit like walking into a reunion with old friends.

Groups of people were scattered across the room or sitting at tables anticipating Azeem Ward’s first public performance with Timmy Linetsky — otherwise known as Underbelly, who is a current student at UC Santa Barbara and Ward’s co-headliner for the night — in Santa Barbara since he graduated last spring. “We met one night at an open mic right after he blew up. We jammed once or twice and then spent the whole summer planning tour dates in Europe,” said Underbelly. The duo travelled all over Europe this summer, bringing their unique fusion of beatbox flute and jazzy hip-hop electronic bass music to people who had watched Ward’s senior flute recital last year when he became an overnight internet sensation in the United Kingdom. This concert was Ward’s discreet homecoming, and many of his close friends were in attendance. “I was really worried no one would come because we could have promoted it better, but a lot of people ended up being here,” said Underbelly. The night began with a DJ set, which the crowd met with mild enthusiasm, up until the last song where a break-dancer took over the floor with dangerous-looking dance moves.</p>\n<p>As soon as Azeem Ward and Underbelly set up on stage, the pit flooded with the bodies of excited college students. Not long after, a surprise special guest — rapper DGA, who has been close friends with Underbelly since high school — took the stage. Their first song was a funky collaboration between the two of them, where Ward showed off his signature beatbox flute. The crowd’s response to hearing Ward’s unconventional music was overwhelmingly positive. “The crowd had a lot of hype considering the size. People really respond to Ward, they are genuinely into it, not in a condescending way,” said DGA. “People know this is kind of funny because its flute, but they also know it’s really good.” The trio soon started playing groovier and groovier songs, such as a flute remix of “Sexy Back” by Justin Timberlake.</p>\n<p>The night then took a more sensual turn when Underbelly announced that he and Ward were about to play some slower, sexier tunes. If the audience was not aware before, they instantly became believers in the fact that the flute could create some sexy beats as Ward continued to deliver smooth note after smooth note. Frequent beat changes and seamless runs defined Ward’s covers and original music, keeping the crowd mesmerized.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the tempo changed from slick and slow to sleep-inducing, Ward and Underbelly reintroduced DGA onstage. The arrival of DGA prompted Ward to announce to the relaxed crowd that he was about to play some of his harder songs. The audience quickly learned what his “hard songs” were high intensity party songs that rekindled the previously calmer energy in the venue. However, it wasn’t until Ward and Underbelly played the first note of their famous cover of Darude’s “Sandstorm” did the crowd completely lose any inhibitions they may have had, grooving and dancing along to the beats. Ward’s flute melodies coaxed the more whimsical personality traits of a few of the concert goers to surface — some boys mimed having a tea party on the venue floor as everyone proceeded to wildly dance and mosh around them.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, the crowd remained completely supportive of their fellow Gauchos Ward and Underbelly. The night progressed as if Ward was playing at a friend’s house show rather than a venue in downtown Santa Barbara. “I expected to see a lot of friends from back home, but I didn’t expect many other people to come since we had to promote this ourselves,” said Ward. “This show was a lot of fun, when you have a connection with people it’s easier to play.” The crowd even broke into the famous UC Santa Barbara “Olè Gaucho” chant, to which Ward adorably shuffled to onstage right before taking a group picture with anyone who could fit into the camera frame.</p>\n<p>Although this small, intimate concert didn’t garner as much attention or press as Ward’s grand senior flute recital, Ward preferred the cozier setting. “My recital was a lot of pressure, this one was a lot more fun,” Ward said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66819\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66819\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/","id":6863,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6862,6861,6860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bay Area Legend Andre Nickatina Comes to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Andre-Nickatina_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Andre-Nickatina_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Friday, Nov. 20 Santa Barbara was fortunate to receive a little taste of Bay Area hip-hop from legendary emcee Andre Nickatina.

A spirited crowd of old-school rap fans gathered at Velvet Jones for an intimate performance that left everyone’s party urges fully satiated. Nickatina is well past his prime, yet he successfully drew a respectable crowd of students, locals and even a few groupies. The rapper’s supporters craved a night of celebration, which he surely delivered.</p>\n<p>Nickatina’s performance opened with the very important question: “Where all my weed smokers at?” From the very beginning he displayed a sense of appreciation and understanding for his demographic. The crowd roared with approval at every opportunity to interact with the NorCal legend, especially when the topics touched on illicit behavior.</p>\n<p>Nickatina’s stage presence enhanced the show’s appeal. Standing well over 6-feet tall, he towered over his crowd and made the stage look small. He was clearly the man that people came to see and his demeanor spoke louder than his rapping. His New York Yankees hat, cocked slightly to the left, oozed “old school emcee.” The do-rag that sat under it provided a tangible memory of early 2000s hip-hop.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It didn’t take long for Nickatina to weave his legendary background into the show. His crowd was energized by knowledge of his pivotal role in pioneering Bay Area hip-hop. After just one song, he called for everyone to put one hand in the sky for his deceased friend and fellow Bay Area icon, Mac Dre. Just a few songs later the crowd happily complied when Nickatina requested, “When I say Mac, y’all say Dre.”</p>\n<p>The peak of the show was marked by Nickatina’s performance of his most popular song, “Ayo for Yayo.” Most of the concertgoers rapped the words, creating a full-blown party atmosphere. Nickatina recognized the vibe of his crowd and occasionally held out his microphone for some rapping assistance.</p>\n<p>By the time Nickatina’s set was ending, the cloud of smoke hovering above the crowd made the venue’s laser beam light fixtures readily visible. The rapper’s go-to audience interactions all revolved around marijuana, so it wasn’t surprising to see (and smell) the culmination of burnt herbs.</p>\n<p>Velvet Jones was a fantastic venue for Nickatina because his performance style fits a small stage perfectly. He created an intimate atmosphere. Fans in the front row were within arms reach and those who wanted to observe from a distance found a nice viewing spot on the balcony. Many attendees over 21-years-old stationed themselves around the bar. Attendees of all ages enjoyed some famous Velvet Jones macaroni and cheese to cap off a satisfying night of entertainment.</p>\n<p>Watching Nickatina felt like a special experience, as his role in pioneering a sound for the Bay Area makes him a walking piece of history. Nickatina’s affiliation with artists like Mac Dre, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and E-40 accentuates his importance amongst some of rap’s great minds.</p>\n<p>The best thing about seeing older performers is that you never know when the opportunity will arise again. Nickatina’s current touring schedule is very sparse. Who knows when he might give up the grind for good?</p>\n<p>If you have the chance to see Nickatina sometime in the future, make sure to buy a ticket. His Santa Barbara show charged a modest $20. This is surely a deal, but can you really put a price on a musical performance that is deeply influenced by 1990s hip-hop tradition? Concerts from artists like Nickatina are hard to come by in today’s music world, where the focus is always on “what’s next.” Take some time to appreciate those who pioneered hip-hop, and keep an eye out for a chance to see the true Bay Area legend, Andre Nickatina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/","id":6864,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6863,6862,6861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arts & Lectures Brings Kronos Quartet to Campbell","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SmileyMurals.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SmileyMurals.jpg?resize=930%2C390&ssl=1","description":"Seven p.m. Thursday night, the 19th of November, Campbell Hall.

It was dark and cold outside of the venue, but inside a crowd of 800 people buzzed. After one look around the hall with its plush velvet seats and nifty fold out desks, a couple things stuck out. One, there were a lot of old people that probably graduated from college maybe 40 years ago. Two, there were a lot of young people that were only there for the sake of their <em>Music 15: Music Appreciation</em> grade. Third, they were selling Crushcakes cupcakes. (Score).</p>\n<p>Now, what could possibly bring these two drastically different demographics to the same place at the same time?</p>\n<p>Ah, of course.

This was not just a run-of-the-mill classical concert. This was a Kronos Quartet concert.</p>\n<p>The Kronos Quartet, although unheard of by a vast majority of the younger generation, is actually kind of a big deal. Based in San Francisco, the quartet is composed of David Harrington and John Sherba on violin, Hank Dutt on viola and Sunny Yang on cello. Some members have changed, but the string quartet has nevertheless been going strong since 1973. And the reason why they are such a big deal is because in those past 40 years, almost 800 works have been written for them by a smorgasbord of composers, including John Adams, Philip Glass and Steve Reich. If none of these names are familiar, then perhaps it should also be mentioned that the Kronos Quartet has performed live with David Bowie, Björk and Paul frickin’ McCartney.</p>\n<p>With accolades ranging from over 1.5 million records sold to touring all over the world, the Kronos Quartet’s music is clearly exceptional. It is experimental. It has covered almost every genre you can think of, including Mexican folk.</p>\n<p>And on Thursday night, it put about a quarter of the audience to sleep.</p>\n<p>To be fair, all of the attendees caught sleeping were <em>Music 15 </em>students who were clearly not appreciating the music as much as they were assigned to. However, for those that did appreciate it, what those pesky students slept through was something fantastic.</p>\n<p>When the Quartet first came on stage to perform for the filled Campbell Hall, they appeared to be simply your average string virtuosos. Whatever stage presence could be there apparently failed to show up on time. Still, as the lights dimmed and they began to play, the quartet filled Campbell Hall with heavenly sounds.</p>\n<p>They played with utmost grace. Even as their pieces became more serious and more intricate, the quartet kept up with every note. Their bodies moved with every note, too, as if they were possessed by the music and every bit of its structure.</p>\n<p>What was also electrifying about the performance was the use of unconventional sounds. During some songs, a crackle was played from the speaker, or a vocal melody that was impossible to understand. Not to mention the other “instruments.”</p>\n<p>“They took out an instrument that looked like an angler fish,” said Sonia, a second year English major. “It looked like a box with a string-light thing that made high frequency sounds.”</p>\n<p>Yes, the out-of-the-norm instruments sounded strange and somewhat startling. But the amazing thing about the Kronos Quartet was that they pulled it all off and made them sound oddly in harmony with their traditional string instruments.</p>\n<p>So when it came to their finale, a performance of “Silent Cranes,” the crowd was moved. “Silent Cranes” is about the Armenian Genocide of the early 1900s. As the quartet fervently worked at their strings, a captivating visual of pictures from the Genocide played along, presenting a narrative. A woman’s voice filled the hall and told her story of living through the terrifying tragedy of witnessing the murders of 15 of her family members in one night.</p>\n<p>After the two-hour concert completed and the Quartet stood up and bowed, those still awake passionately applauded. Those who were asleep quickly woke up and followed suit.</p>\n<p>For both the young and the old, the Kronos Quartet is a unique group of musicians to take note of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66822\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/arts-lectures-brings-kronos-quartet-to-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66822\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/arts-lectures-brings-kronos-quartet-to-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/arts-lectures-brings-kronos-quartet-to-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/arts-lectures-brings-kronos-quartet-to-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/arts-lectures-brings-kronos-quartet-to-campbell/","id":6865,"author":{"id":732,"name":"Mackenzie Hart"},"related":[6864,6863,6862],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
