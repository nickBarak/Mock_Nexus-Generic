But beyond the Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code, the role requires “a great deal of listening” and a willingness for personal connection, according to Nguyen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), which is required to wait for students to reach out on their own accord before offering help, suffers from a lack of visibility imbued in the position, an element of his office that he has struggled to promote throughout the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“S.A.G. is very different from the other A.S. offices. It’s a little more removed from A.S. as an entity,” Nguyen said. “It’s really all for the students, and there’s nothing more rewarding than a student walking out of your office, and them knowing it isn’t the end of the world, and knowing what’s about to happen to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen, an off-campus senator in the 2018-2019 school year and the sole contender for the position of S.A.G. when he ran in 2019, was criticized for his lack of relevant experience for the position. He had “zero experience” within the OSA while <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/\">running for the position</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen acknowledged his lack of experience for the role, calling it something he “worked really, really hard to overcome.” He said he worked to educate himself on the ins and outs of the office through relationships with mentors from A.S. and the Isla Vista community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also acknowledged his own personal growth and the empathy that was required of him to properly carry out the duties of the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was scared, running for this position. I was so scared I was going to mess it up. But then, as I went through the job, I realized that the most important part of it was being really empathetic, and really present,” Nguyen explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other A.S. positions, the work of the S.A.G. is inherently less transparent because it deals with confidential case files. While Nguyen couldn’t discuss specific cases, he said he definitely noticed “a trend in plagiarism cases” throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually, if students know they’re guilty, they’ll just bite the bullet, take the punishment,” Nguyen said. But for “students who truly thought they hadn’t plagiarized,” Nguyen and his team were able to take the issue to the faculty member and work out a solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While casework like this is an important part of the job, Nguyen credited Grecia Martinez, his predecessor, as helpful to some of his office’s other successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grecia was amazing,” he said. “She sat down with me, explained so many of her projects, and a lot of these we worked on during my term.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That included the digitization of case intake forms so future S.A.G.’s can access the database and look up how a particular case was handled in the past for reference, Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also took Martinez’s advice and decided to drop one of his main campaigning platforms, a school-wide poll to see what services students needed as a whole, which was first suggested by Jack Tannenbaum, the 2017-2018 S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I talked to Grecia about it, she thought, and I agreed, that the office, since it’s still so new, really needed to focus on outreach first, and not this student-body poll,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the poll didn’t work out for the OSA, Nguyen has hopes that other facets of A.S. will continue to work on a similar project to measure students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That type of poll, to see what the student body needs, could be really helpful to any senators, to any office,” he said, adding that A.S. President Alison Sir’s office is working on a project like this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the interview, Nguyen said he hadn’t heard from his successor, the 2019-2020 S.A.G.-elect Melissa Perez, but suggested that going forward, she should look towards continuing promoting the visibility of the S.A.G. office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a tool a lot of students need. So it would be cool to see her doing stuff like that, to promote the office,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen agreed that in some ways, his term in office had failed to bring the necessary visibility to the community outside of A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I worked on bringing visibility within A.S. because the office is so new that even people in A.S. didn’t really know about it. I did that with the hopes that those people would spread it to their circles, and we would expand the office that way,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I recognize that for people in none of those circles, there is still a lack of visibility. So I hope Melissa can really focus on that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Nguyen did credit his time and work in the office for successfully building a “very strong, very tight-knit team.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone received all the training, everyone was at every briefing. Everyone, including myself, felt the weight of the job. We knew that a student’s future could be on the line if we weren’t doing our jobs properly,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen also noted that all of his team members who aren’t graduating plan on staying with the office, provided Perez rehires them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he entered the office, Nguyen said only one person from the previous year remained, so he “hired everyone new,” and “really wanted to hire people who were going to stay and love the job,” he said </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with the efforts of Nguyen’s team, working together during the coronavirus pandemic has been difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really just aren’t seeing the case number[s] that we were at school,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, court proceedings for academic misconduct cases have been changing due to the pandemic, according to Nguyen, who added that “everyone is trying to proceed business as usual, but doing so remotely, with things like altered deadlines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite the challenges he faced during his term, Nguyen said he is “eternally grateful” for his time as S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has changed me in ways I didn’t know were possible,” he said. “It was the most rewarding work I’ve ever done in my life. But it was also the hardest work.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on what he would change about the role, Nguyen looked back to the importance of compassion and empathy that he has learned over the past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really wish that there would be more of an emphasis on empathy for this role. I know that’s something you couldn’t really put in legal code — it probably isn’t very legal — but just really, for the next person who does this job to know, it demands the most caring individual,” he said. “That’s so important to this job.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said the position of Student Advocate General was created in 2015.

Senate resolutions actually affect university policy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direct percentage of Senate resolutions that affect university policy. There are several different types of bills/resolutions that the Senate passes, but the main two are positional and directional resolutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional bill/resolution is one that “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events.” Positional resolutions require a two thirds vote. For example, a positional resolution passed this past year was one in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-passes-three-resolutions-in-support-of-afscme-strike-one-which-suspends-a-s-operations-in-solidarity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support of the AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional bill/resolution is one that “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, Committees and/or the Senate to specific duties.” A directional resolution requires a 50% plus 1 vote – in the case of the 69th Senate, 13 votes. One example of a directional resolution passed by the Senate during this past year is “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/new-resolution-keeps-former-a-s-advisor-kings-legacy-alive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which awards five students each a $500 grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further details about the types of bills and resolutions that the Senate can pass begins on page 313 of Legal Code under the Policy 6: Main Motions section in the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do my student fees go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the 2018-2019 school year, students pay $631.83 in A.S. and Graduate Student Association (GSA) fees and $1,188.87 in lock-in fees – overall, paying $1,820.70 in student fees each school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student fees given to A.S. fund Arts &amp; Lectures, the Child Care Center, Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.), Disabled Student Services, the Events Center, intramural sports, the Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Student Life, Recreational Sports, the Coastal Fund, Student Health and the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students fees designated as lock-in fees include Arts &amp; Lectures, bike path maintenance, a second C.L.A.S. fee, Career Services, C.A.P.S., E.O.P., Event Center, the Green Initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fund (TGIF)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health &amp; Wellness, a second MCC fee, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Recreation Center among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fees fall under both of these categories, such as two separate MCC fees and two C.L.A.S. fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact breakdown of fees for the 2018-2019 school year can be found <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/2018-19cbf.pdf?sfvrsn=6518aa46_2\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were both parties founded?

The other presidential candidate, Zion Solomon, said during the presidential candidate forum that they would like to keep student fees the same, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the minimum voting percentage threshold needed to win if a candidate is unopposed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in A.S. Legal Code, at least 20% of all eligible undergraduate students must vote in the election for it to be valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual candidates, Elections Board uses the Droop Quota to calculate the minimum number of voters needed for a candidate to be elected. The formula is as follows: Votes Needed = (Valid Votes Cast / Number of Seats + 1) + 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further information about the quota can be found on page 298 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is a special election? Is this a special election?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a special election. A special election can happen when a position within the executive offices – such as the president, EVPLA, EVPSA, IVP or S.A.G. – becomes vacant. Special election rules are controlled by Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, there have been two special elections: the first in Fall Quarter 2018 and the second in Winter Quarter 2019. Both elections attempted to fulfill the vacant EVPSA position; during both, less than the minimum required number of students voted, invaliding the results. </span></p>\n<p><b>Who is advising elections? Who are members of the committee in charge of elections? Do we get to see the minutes?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board is in charge of the elections. There are seven members of the board, and they are advised by Kendra Sandoval and Ruth Garcia Guevara. Election Board minutes are not open to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are on Elections Board cannot run for any senatorial or executive position or be a representative for any campus political party. </span></p>\n<p><b>Is results night still in the UCen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Results night will happen in the UCen’s Hub at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. </span></p>\n<p><b>What endorsements besides the </b><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b> can candidates get? Is there a list? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is not an explicit list of who can endorse, but rather only a list of who cannot endorse candidates. As stated in Legal Code, all A.S. entities cannot endorse candidates and parties. Further details about endorsements can be found on page 283 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 22, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why doesn’t A.S. have greater authority over the Isla Vista area?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. has representation within I.V. through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) position, held by third-year global studies major Jeike Meijer. The EVPLA can advocate on behalf of UCSB students’ needs in I.V., but they cannot make direct changes to laws; instead, they work with governmental bodies that make those decisions, such as the I.V. Recreation and Parks District and the I.V. Community Service District, to make change within the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB owns property in I.V., but cannot control or make decisions over I.V. as a whole because, by nature, the two are separate. UCSB is a university; I.V. is an unincorporated district – and home to families, private businesses and more, not just students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because UCSB and I.V.’s histories are so intertwined, there are ways in which the university can directly or indirectly exert influence over what happens in I.V. For example, the university has a representative on the I.V. CSD, who serves as a coordinator between the two entities. Additionally, UCSB gives a $200,000 grant to the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates for this year’s EVPLA election are third-year political science Matthew Griffin and third-year environmental studies major Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of compensation do A.S. members receive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. executive director and other full-time staff members within A.S. receive yearly salaries. For example, the current A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez, received $110,911 for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executives receive $3,000 per quarter, while A.S. senators receive $400 dollars per quarter for serving on the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both face different sets of rules and requirements, which can be found in A.S. legal code. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the Daily Nexus have beef with the A.S. Senate? What’s up with always criticizing their shortcomings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not “have beef” with the A.S. Senate. Just as with any other relationship between reporters and the government officials they cover, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports on both the Senate’s shortfalls and its successes. As a campus newspaper, it is important that we hold A.S. accountable because, after all, the same people who read the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the ones giving A.S. their money to spend. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the ideological differences between CU and I.V. party?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our endorsement interviews, we asked each candidate running for an executive position about the difference between Campus United and the Isla Vista Party, and they all gave various vague answers. Some candidates said their party thinks outside of the box, while others said their party was like a family to them. The executive candidates also emphasized that they would not speak about the opposing party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United has a website that includes information about its platform: </span><a href=\"https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party has a Facebook page that is regularly updated. However, there aren’t many details on the page regarding the party’s platform and ideologies: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/</span></a></p>\n<p><b>Where can I view a list of candidates?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A list of all candidates can be seen on our website <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the programs that come from my student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing Senate with a budget to spend throughout the year, your student fees fund a variety of different programs across campus. For example, the A.S. Program Borard is funded by student fees, as well as the Bike Shop, Queer Commission, Food Bank and many others. You can find the full list of A.S. funded entities here: </span><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 16, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student enrolled at UCSB pays </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.61 every quarter to Associated Students to go toward “a wide variety of operations of Associated Students that benefit the students of UCSB, the campus and the surrounding community,” as written on the A.S. Finance and Business website. This amounts to an estimated $14 million a year, as of last reported numbers. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the different A.S. positions? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. serves as an umbrella for dozens of organizations. The most well-known divisions of A.S. include the legislative branch (the A.S. Senate), the executive branch (the A.S. Executives) and the judicial branch (the A.S. Judicial Council). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the A.S. Senate, there are 25 senatorial positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 25 senators are elected based on different constituencies; there are 12 off-campus senator seats, five on-campus senator seats, four Letters &amp; Science senator seats, one College of Engineering senator seat, one College of Creative Studies senator seat, one transfer senator seat and one university-owned off-campus senator seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no College of Creative Studies senator for the past school year, and no students have declared candidacy for the seat this year’s election as of press time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the executive branch, there are five A.S. executive positions: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBASOP/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ivpucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal vice president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IVP), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbEVPSA/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB6ux9CZOA9eMPbLvNNLuo5kIGZGoj3jtgxwRvfm0rLaYKe9A5qbzuS2FCpyxrzSJFwR85Z0BVYmuyX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for statewide affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPSA), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evplaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for local affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPLA) and the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/osaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student advocate general</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (S.A.G.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPSA position has been vacant since Spring Quarter 2018 following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales and the two subsequent special elections that failed to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president serves as a representative of UCSB at the systemwide level and is a voice for students within the UCSB administration. They also work on projects within their own office to enhance the UCSB student experience and sit on various committees around campus. The IVP presides over the A.S. Senate, and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The EVPLA works with local government bodies, such as the I.V. Community Services District and the I.V. Recreation and Park District. The EVPSA advocates for UCSB student issues at the state and federal level. Finally, the S.A.G. heads up the Office of the Student Advocate, which provides support for students/student groups who are involved in a dispute with the university.</span></p>\n<p><b>How can you reach out to your senators and other executives?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to contact your senators and executives. As of this year, the 69th senate passed a resolution that requires senators to provide their constituencies with an official Facebook page. A.S. executives also have official Facebook pages, where you will find their office hours, the location of their office hours, contact info and projects they are currently undertaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the entire Senate as a whole, students or community members can speak at public forum during weekly Senate meetings, which begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Flying A room of the University Center. The Senate does not hold meetings during Week 10 or finals week. </span></p>\n<p><b>When does voting begin?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting officially begins on April 22 at 8 a.m., or Monday of Week 4. It ends on April 25 at 4 p.m. The results will be announced on April 25 at a time and place to be determined. Log onto G.O.L.D. to cast your vote.</span></p>\n<p>A full version of A.S.

He also had “a dirty white beard, [was] wearing mussed clothing or dirty in appearance.” He may be driving an older, four-door gray car that looks “similar to a Chevy Volt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first victim said her attacker “smelled heavily of alcohol”; the second said he smelled like marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Tuesday evening, he has not been apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first assault occurred on Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. along a creek near Phelps Road and Ocean Walk Lane, when the suspect grabbed a 22-year-old female jogger by the shoulder and arm “in an attempt to pull her closer to him,” according to an initial </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-10/timely-warning-issued-for-assault-on-campus-adjacent-property/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim punched at the suspect in an attempt to break free, but the suspect then “grabbed the victim by her shoulders and punched her in the face,” according to the initial timely warning. She was able to break free and run back to her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim sustained “redness and swelling” to her face during the assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second assault occurred Monday evening at approximately 10:30 p.m. An 18-year-old female was waiting for friends by her car in the Haskell’s Beach parking area in Goleta when she noticed a man sitting in a dark-colored vehicle nearby, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man then approached her, placed his hand on her back and asked her if she was OK. He then “reached under the front of her shirt and sexually assaulted her,” according to the release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then “kicked at the suspect, striking him in the groin area.” She then ran to her friends for help, while the suspect fled to his vehicle and drove away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proximity of the attacks, similar suspect descriptions and similar locations, being “isolated areas near rural access,” led the Sheriff’s Office to believe the assaults were perpetrated by the same suspect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone with more information about the suspect can contact the department at (805) 681-4100 or submit an anonymous report </span><a href=\"http://www.sbsheriff.org/anonymoustips.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Levine, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/galoustian-files-motion-in-court-requesting-ucpd-internal-documents-alleging-violation-of-due-process-in-his-arrest-and-investigation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented a Pitchess motion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is used in instances when a defendant wants to request information from a police officer’s personnel file. The motion was originally filed with the court on Oct. 3, 2019. Levine’s motion resulted in the trial being pushed back to January 2020; it was initially scheduled to begin on Dec. 4, 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine was particularly interested in investigating Officer Ryan Hashimoto, who allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case” and was an initial investigator in Galoustian’s case, which began in December 2017, when he was first arrested. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This incident was detailed in a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed against the UC Santa Barbara Police Department in March, in which Officer Ryan Smith, who is referred to as John Doe in court documents, alleged widespread racism, misconduct and conspiracy within the department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alison Bernal, an attorney for the Regents of the University of California, and Lieutenant Robert Romero of UCPD, appeared as representatives of the department at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. The two confirmed to Judge James Herman that an internal affairs investigation had just been opened against Hashimoto and that it would take approximately six months for it to conclude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman ruled against Levine’s motion, which named multiple officers — Hashimoto, Officers Michael Little and Tiffany Little and Lieutenant Mark Signa — who Bernal, Romero and Karapetian confirmed were not involved in the case, but still granted Levine the additional time to investigate Hashimoto independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman initially considered pushing the trial back a full six months to allow Levine access to the internal affairs findings, but Karapetian, who is also a senior deputy district attorney for Santa Barbara County, pressed the judge to consider the victims, who she said were “eager” and “anxious” to get the trial over with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would be in strong opposition to any continuance of this case,” Karapetian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine, who expressed frustration that he first learned about the civil suit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> newspaper articles, argued that the defense needed time to conduct its own investigation, particularly since Levine was without the resources and results of the internal affairs investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawyers for the University of California Board of Regents, including Bernal, filed an opposing motion on Oct. 18, arguing that because many of the officers named in the motion were not involved in Galoustian’s investigation or arrest, Herman should exclude them from his decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Herman emphasized that the defendant had a right to “exculpatory” information — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evidence that clears the defendant from guilt in a criminal trial — which</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could arise from an investigation of Hashimoto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine also said the defense would be interested in calling Hashimoto as a key witness for the trial, even as Karapetian stressed to the judge that the prosecution would not be calling him or using his statements because of the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, who is currently facing 33 felony charges on behalf of two victims, was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing a large brace on his right leg at the Wednesday afternoon court appearance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Levine, Galoustian has been “very ill” and received medical treatment. Levine did not comment further on Galoustian’s condition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trial is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 8, 2020 and is expected to take approximately 15 court days. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
