As the Gauchos know, having a new coach means adjusting to a whole new system, which can take time.</p>\n<p>“It feels like we’re really coming together and starting to really mesh as a group,” sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We feel really good after those two wins, emphasizing the wins [part].”</p>\n<p>An offensive key for Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has been balanced scoring and not solely relying on senior guard Emilie Johnson. Johnson leads the team with 14.7 points per game, but Nesbit and junior forward Sweets Underwood also average double figures.</p>\n<p>“Anybody on our team can step up any night,” Locke said. “We have to make sure they take good shots in rhythm and just keep executing.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit has made a huge impact in the last two games, averaging 13.5 points. Overall, she leads the team in assists with 3.25 per contest.</p>\n<p>“[Nesbit’s] been a spark off the bench,” Locke said. “She’s able to see the game a bit more, see what’s open, and then been able to come in and execute.”</p>\n<p>Washington’s roster also contains three players averaging at least 12 points per game. The Gauchos will need to be aware of Regina Rogers, their leading scorer at 14.7 points per game and shooting 76 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We have to get after it and play our team defense,” Locke said. “We need to know the personnel, continue to rebound and give them one shot.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in their first two games on the road, UCSB has jumped out to a quick start in their last two games, taking large leads into halftime.</p>\n<p>The key will be maintaining their consistency in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We just have to be a team that can play both halves, all 40 minutes,” Adrian said. “We need to know that teams are going to keep battling and not just roll over.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With Westmont up 44-43 in the second half, Boswell and freshman guard T.J. Taylor scored a combined 12 points for the Gauchos to bring the score to 56-45.</p>\n<p>Taylor finished the night with eight points — six coming in that crucial second half run.</p>\n<p>“Our bench was really good,” Williams said. “The bench has been very, very productive so far this year. We have total confidence in playing them.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Johnson struggled to find his shot in the first half but proved dominant in the last 15 minutes, pounding the paint for most of his baskets and ending the night with 20 points, 12 rebounds (10 offensive) and four steals.</p>\n<p>“He needs to do more, not just settle for perimeter fade away as part of his game,” Williams said. “What makes Orlando and [Nunnally] special and really tough to play against is they’re versatile enough to hurt you from inside and out.”</p>\n<p>Westmont hung with the Gauchos for a large portion in the game thanks to junior guard Jordan Sachs’ game-high 25-point performance to go along with a team-high seven rebounds. However, Sachs’ play couldn’t propel the Warriors past UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We put bodies on them, we worked hard on defense and we were just knocking down shots taking care of the ball as best as we could,” Sachs said. “I think Orlando grabbed every [offensive] board in the last eight minutes.

UCSB’s high defensive intensity was on display, holding St. Mary’s to just 14 points.</p>\n<p>“We feel like if we put the pressure initially like we did tonight on the defensive end of things that we can have a chance to win games,” Mitchell said. “It was definitely by far the best [defensive effort] in the first three games. They had some great players, but we did a great job on the defensive end.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Gauchos found their stride offensively, shooting 53.8 percent from the field in the first half. With just under three minutes left, the Gauchos had racked up an impressive 28-point lead, the largest lead of the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think it was just the energy level,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We were feeding off of each other and we know now how we can [play] because of that run in the first half.”</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story. After halftime, the Gaels continued a 7-0 run that ended the first half and continued to cut into the Gaucho lead, assisted by UCSB fouls. By the eight-minute mark, UCSB was in the penalty. On the game, St. Mary’s converted 21 of their 30 free throws.</p>\n<p>“We have to play [like we did in the first half] for 40 minutes,” Johnson said. “We can’t dip off or have any momentum swings; we need to be in control for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>A charge by junior center Kirsten Tilleman led to a technical foul by St. Mary’s coach. With just over a minute remaining, the Gaels’ leading scorer and senior guard Jasmine Smith hit a three to bring the lead down to six points. UCSB converted their free throws down the stretch to seal the win.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a lot more to this team and I know we’re going to continue to grow and get better,” Mitchell said. “With that, there should be a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers were an issue in Santa Barbara’s first two games and came back to haunt the Gauchos, who committed 16 second-half turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was just a lack of focus,” Johnson said. “We need to take care of the ball, be strong with it. Some of the turnovers were unforced and some had to do with execution and being there for each other because they were trapping and double teaming.”</p>\n<p>Three UCSB players finished in double figures, including Nesbit who set a new team high with 15 points and provided a big spark off the bench. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig, who propelled the Gauchos offensively in the first half, finished with nine points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. However, it was truly a concerted effort, as every player who stepped on the court had at least one point.</p>\n<p>“It was a great team effort,” Mitchell said. “I think at different stages of the game there were different players stepping up. We had three players in double figures, which will win us games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB resumes play Saturday against Loyola Marymount. The game will begin at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-gaels-thunderdome-game/","id":815,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[814,813,812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tears Apart Lions for Second-Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team earned its second consecutive win Saturday afternoon in the Thunderdome against visiting Loyola Marymount 66-49.

With 13:36 remaining, junior forward Sweets Underwood converted a three-point play to bring the lead to 10. But this time the Gauchos never again allowed their opponents to come within the single digits.</p>\n<p>“We’re pushing the ball early,” Mitchell said. “We’re setting the tone on the offensive end by making the other team get back and play transition defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 43.8 percent from the field in the first half, compared to LMU’s 23.3 percent.</p>\n<p>The lead continued to blossom for UCSB, and during the second half the lead reached its largest margin at 23 points.</p>\n<p>“We went into it wanting to learn from last game,” junior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “The last game we had, we got a lead early, but we gave it up in the second half, so [this time] we really wanted to stick with it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded the Lions and killed them in second chance points at 21-9.</p>\n<p>“[Rebounding is] something we work every single day on because of our lack of height,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “We’re tired of hearing about it, so we’re going to do something about it and we’re going to rebound.”</p>\n<p>However, turnovers are often the most impressive statistic on the stat sheet — and where the biggest improvements can be made. UCSB turned the ball over nine times in the entire contest while tallying 13 assists.</p>\n<p>While LMU’s star, junior guard Alex Cowling, tallied 22 points on the game, 14 of them came in the second half with the lead firmly under control. Cowling was the only player in double figures for the Lions.</p>\n<p>“[The strategy] was to let her score as many as she could and let nobody else score,” Mitchell said. “She’s a great scorer, but at the end of the day, if you only have one player in double figures, it’s going to be hard for a team to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit, Underwood and Johnson were all in double figures for the Gauchos. While Underwood tallied her third double-double of the season, Johnson caught fire in the second half and led the Gauchos offensively with 21 points and four assists, hitting 5-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“We know how good we can be when we’re sharp, focused and playing as a team,” Johnson said. “We can’t win a ball game when all our players aren’t at their best. We have to come out and win together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finishes off its three-game home stand Wednesday against Washington.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/ucsb-tears-lions-secondstraight-win/","id":816,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[815,814,813],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
