Junior libero Luna Tsujimoto is one of seven Big West players to average at least four digs per set in conference play; her mark of 4.28 per set is about a half dig shy of Gaucho sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi’s 4.71 league-leading number. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this will surely be UCSB’s final match of the year, there are still many bright spots in what was a vastly improved season for the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lindsey Ruddins will wrap up a tremendously successful conference schedule in which she averaged 3.83 kills per set (fifth in the Big West), .56 service aces per set (second), 2.06 digs per set (28th) and 4.5 points per set (third). If she can top 20 kills in the contest, it would be her third time in four matches and fifth this season. After missing out on the 2015 season, Ruddins has proved to be every bit as good as billed in 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After transferring from Wisconsin, Hannah Juley, too, was an absolute standout for the Gauchos in 2016. Finishing with the fifth-most assists per set amongst her Big West competition, Juley hit her stride when the conference schedule started. Since then she’s accumulated five double-doubles, eight matches with at least 40 assists and two with at least 50. A key concern this season for the Gauchos was locking down the setter position, and Juley has left no question about the direction for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB can also rest easy knowing it has possibly the Big West’s best libero in Petrachi. The sophomore from Modena, Italy leads the conference in digs per set and comes into the match with four straight 20-dig efforts after only five up to that point in the year. On the verge of completing her second season, Petrachi’s experience will be vital for the Gauchos going forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior middle blockers Elizabeth Sheffield and Phoebe Grunt will compete in their final match for UCSB Wednesday night, hoping to cap their careers with a victory. Grunt averaged career bests in kills per set with 1.95, and in hitting percentage with .355 in 2016, capping a stellar season despite playing in the fewest matches in her tenure with the Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her second year with the team, Sheffield improved her hitting percentage from .244 to .312, and her kills per set from 1.73 to 1.75. She’s gotten to at least 10 points in nine of her last 12 matches and will look to continue that trend in the last match of her collegiate career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With one match left in what has been a rollercoaster year, the Gauchos still have much to glean from the 2016 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and UC Irvine face off in the final match of the season for both teams at 5 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 23,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-23/gauchos-hope-to-end-season-on-a-high-note/","id":5001,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5000,4999,4998],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Winners in Four Straight, Sweeps UCD & UCI Over Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winners in five of its last six matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has now won four consecutive matches after defeating UC Davis and UC Irvine over the weekend.

Their .029 hitting percentage looked even worse against the Aggies’ .400 mark, and they would go on to lose by 10 points despite first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s four kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos got out to an early lead, a 6-1 Davis run would put the Gauchos in a 9-12 hole, and they weren’t able to close the gap under two for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>Facing an end to their recent hot streak, the Gauchos launched their comeback in the third set when an 8-9 deficit became a 16-9 lead, aided by seven straight Ruddins serves.</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann started the run with a kill on an assist by redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Sydney Bast, followed by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Hasselmann contributing a block to further shift the tide.</p>\n<p>A Ruddins service ace pushed the lead to two, tying the second highest lead to that point in the set, and a kill from Elizabeth Sheffield resulted in a UC Davis timeout.</p>\n<p>They would find no help in the respite, however, as an attack error from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom, followed by two Ruddins service aces and another Sheffield kill, capped the stretch at 16-9 UCSB, a buffer that would extend throughout the set.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would not go down easily in the fourth set, as three kills from first-year outside hitter Lauren Matias contributed to a five-point run that would tie the game at 12.</p>\n<p>Despite the burst, UCSB would never trail again, as a continuous back-and-forth culminated with two kills from first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen and a 25-23 Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB controlled the tiebreaker, hitting a whopping .538 and winning 15-6, as after the Aggies took a 2-0 lead to start, a 12-3 run by the Gauchos would essentially seal the match.</p>\n<p>The comeback from a two-set deficit was enabled by a career evening from outside hitter Chloe Allen, whose 19 kills, .394 hitting percentage, six digs and two block assists were massive for the Gauchos, especially as junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman went down with an injury in last week’s match against Cal Poly and was unable to play against Davis.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Elizabeth Sheffield were also both rocking on the offensive end with 16 and 14 kills respectively. Ruddins added three service aces as well as 10 digs to give herself a double-double, and Sheffield continued her consistent efficiency, hitting .481 on the night.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley led the match with 40 assists and completed a double-double of her own with 11 digs, extending her streak of outstanding play that has coincided with the Gauchos’ recent run.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had five players finish with at least eight kills, paced by senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht with 11. Their setters, sophomore Maddie Merlino and senior Sophia Mar, combined for 43 assists, as the two setters’ attack potency was on full display Thursday night.</p>\n<p>UC Davis outside hitters first-year Lauren Matias and sophomore Emily Allen collected 11 digs each, completing double-doubles with their kills, and Sophia Mar’s 11 digs also gave her a double-double for the match.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match with UC Irvine was substantially less dramatic, exemplified by the Gauchos outhitting the Anteaters by at least .050 in each of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The first set was the match’s closest, as despite holding a three-to-four-point lead for the majority of the frame, the Anteaters were able to get a couple big scores and pull within two when faced with game point 24-20.</p>\n<p>An attack error on senior setter Shelley Anderson would seal their fate, however, as UC Irvine couldn’t capitalize on what would be their high watermark of the evening.</p>\n<p>The second and final sets would play out similarly to one another, as both began with decent competition between the two teams; they were tied at 11 in the second, and the Gauchos held an 11-10 run in the third.</p>\n<p>Massive runs in each game by the Gauchos would follow in each set, however, and neither featured any substantial late-set drama.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was huge for the Gauchos in this one, with 15 kills, eight service aces and nine digs, almost completing a triple-double. Megan Rice, Chloe Allen, Elizabeth Sheffield and senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt would all assist her offensively, chipping in at least seven kills apiece.</p>\n<p>Libero Emilia Petrachi turned in a brilliant performance with 20 digs (6.67 digs per set), and set the tone for what was an unstoppable Gaucho defense. Sheffield assisted in three blocks, and Hannah Juley and Sydney Bast added seven and 11 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>No one on UC Irvine was able to amass double-digit kills, though junior libero Luna Tsujimoto led the match with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>Setter Shelley Anderson was also potent for the Anteaters, her 27 assists a team high and second in the match only to UCSB’s Hannah Juley, who finished with 10 more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and push their winning streak to five next weekend at home, with Friday and Saturday matches against Cal state Fullerton and UC Riverside, respectively. Both matches are at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/","id":4998,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4997,4996,4995],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Pursuing NCAA Bid, Hopes To Upset No. 14 Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After suffering their first loss in the last five matches, the Gauchos will look to rebound by upsetting No. 14 Hawaii.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team is back on the road this weekend as the team heads to Hawaii to play the 14th- ranked team in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a fun team to play,” Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch of the Hawaii squad, said. “I know we’ll be up and excited to play them.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine lead the conference with a 13-1conference record, 20-5 overall and hold a 1.5 game lead on the Long Beach State 49ers in the Big West standings.

Mitchem also ranks fourth with a .353 hitting percentage, completing what has been a ferociously efficient duo in the middle for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, Hawaii also relies on first-year setter Norene Iosia. UCSB’s redshirt first-year setter Hannah Juley and Iosia have put up very similar stats through their respective Big West schedules, as Iosia barely trails Juley’s mark of 10.35 assists per set with 10.20 of her own.</p>\n<p>Iosia is coming off double-doubles in her last two matches, with 33 assists and 12 digs against UC Davis following a 28 assist and 11 dig effort against UC Irvine,</p>\n<p>Hawaii is one of two teams in the Big West without a player averaging four digs per set in conference play, though junior libero Savanah Kahakai’s 3.96 figure is just shy of the mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi and every one of her 4.59 digs per set against Big West foes Saturday, as she presents a situation where UCSB may have a talent advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue to ride the offensive shockwaves of their redshirt first-years Lindsey Ruddins and Hannah Juley.</p>\n<p>Ruddins has been seventh-best in kills per set during Big West play, averaging 3.70. While she was relatively shut down with 12 kills in the match against UC Riverside, Ruddins had 27 kills in a monster outing against Cal State Fullerton the night before, showing just how deadly she can be.</p>\n<p>Juley had 94 assists over this past weekend, 47 in each match, and will have to be on her A-game for the Gauchos to have a shot against the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>She’s been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, a trend that will need to continue for the first-year if UCSB is to have any hope of their postseason dreams becoming reality.</p>\n<p>Mindset will be important for the Gauchos heading into the final two matches. With their playoff hopes lingering in uncertainty, intensity is a focus for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We can go into this with absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “An aggressive mindset is absolutely what we need.”</p>\n<p>Relating to gains throughout their season, UCSB’s best weekends this year have come after stretches of great practices, a trend that was shaken last week.</p>\n<p>“Over the last month, every week we’ve had great practices except for last week,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “They know that, they recognize that and they realize how important that is and how much it carries over to the games. The key is that we just stay confident.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and maintain that confidence and defeat a Hawaii team that has appeared, at times, unbeatable.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to breathe some fire back into their season on Saturday night, facing off against Hawaii at 9 p.m. Pacific time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of November, 17 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74290\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74290\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-pursuing-ncaa-bid-hopes-to-upset-no-14-hawaii/","id":4999,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4998,4997,4996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Defeat in Final Road Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its last opportunity at a possible postseason birth, the UCSB women's volleyball team saw its NCAA Tournament hopes fizzle as it was unable to defeat No. 14 Hawaii.

Hawaii found an early lead behind two service aces from senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, and was able to control the early portion of the set, eventually leading 17-11.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">A timeout from Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch would make all the difference, however, as the Gauchos would follow the stoppage with a 14-4 run to win the set.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The final push, an 8-1 drubbing of the Rainbow Wahine, was spearheaded by the service work of outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins; the redshirt freshman had two service aces over the stretch, as well as an assist to redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who would rack up assists of her own on half of UCSB’s final eight points.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman outside hitter Chloe Allen would also collect three kills over the stretch, finishing with 10 in the match, good for second most on the Gauchos and her third-highest output for the season.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB played the Rainbow Wahine to a 6-3 advantage in the second set, a peak in the Gauchos’ hopes for the evening. An eight-point Hawaii run would follow, and UCSB never posed much of a threat for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The third frame saw a similar effort from the Gauchos to begin the set, but another devastating 10-2 Hawaii run midway through, pushing the lead to 20-13, was again UCSB’s downfall.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The Gauchos weren’t able to put up much of a fight in the fourth game, never holding a lead on the way to finishing with only 10 points</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB was held to hitting percentages of -.031, .159 and .000 in the final three sets, starkly contrasting with the .323, .304, and .400 marks achieved by the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Lindsey Ruddins was still very productive for the Gauchos, accumulating 21 kills, albeit on a whopping 68 attempts (.235 kill percentage), along with three service aces and six digs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">She fell just short of Hawaii’s Nikki Taylor, who concluded Saturday’s match with a double-double on 22 kills (.405 kill percentage) and 11 digs, adding three service aces for good measure. Both were far more prolific than their averages, 4.59 kills per set for Taylor and 4.13 for Ruddins.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The difference in Saturday’s match was Taylor’s support compared to Ruddins’, as three other rainbow Wahine finished with at least eight kills, while only two other Gauchos were able to accomplish the feat. Furthermore, four Gauchos finished with negative hitting percentages, all of whom participated in at least three sets.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Freshman Rainbow Wahine setter Norene Iosia slightly outplayed UCSB’s Hannah Juley, finishing with 40 assists as opposed to Juley’s 34, and completing a double-double with 15 digs while Juley could only get to four of her own.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Emilia Petrachi, the sophomore who’s arguably the Big West’s best libero, paced all players by 10 digs with 25 on the night, though only one other Gaucho was able to top double-digit digs and three members of the Hawaii team were able to do so.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Hawaii will look to move up from their 14th position in the national rankings after sweeping its weekend contests against the Gauchos and the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">UCSB will have one opportunity to conclude their season on a high note despite the sting of missing out on the playoffs with a home match against UC Irvine on Wednesday, Nov. 23 at 5 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-21/gauchos-fall-to-defeat-in-final-road-match/","id":5000,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4999,4998,4997],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
