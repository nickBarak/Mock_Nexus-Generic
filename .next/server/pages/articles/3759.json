One of the suspects was allegedly armed with a souvenir baseball bat, according to the Santa Barbara Sherrif’s Office (SBSO). During the course of the robbery, one male victim sustained a black eye and another male victim broke his hand. Within the same night, SBSO identified a female driver of the getaway vehicle as first-year student Breanna Kromer, 18, and she was taken into police custody after a traffic stop on Embarcadero Del Mar. Kromer was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of robbery, resisting arrest and conspiracy. Public Information Officer for SBSO Kelly Hoover said one of the suspects was familiar with a resident at the location, and the incident “wasn’t a random crime.”</p>\n<p>Garcia was arrested the next day and booked into the jail on charges of first degree robbery and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 31, SBSO arrested White and the 17-year-old male after receiving an anonymous tip about their location at a residence on the 900 block of Camino Lindo. SBSO, along with I.V. Foot Patrol, attempted to contact the suspects, but the suspects refused to comply. UCPD officers set up a perimeter and contained the area. After entering the residence with the K-9 Unit, the officers were able to arrest and book White and the 17-year-old for robbery, conspiracy and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>White is still in police custody and is being held on $100,000 bail, according to SBSO. The juvenile was released with pending charges.</p>\n<p>Garcia is currently on a conditional own recognizance release (OR). Benjamin T. Ladinig, chief prosecutor for the case, said the court released Garcia on OR due to the recommendation of the Santa Barbara County Jail conditional own recognizance release/bail release (OR/BR) unit.</p>\n<p>According to the OR/BR report by the Santa Barbara County Superior Court, SBSO arresting officer said Garcia “made threats against the victim during jail phone calls.” Prior to Garcia’s release, alleged victims one and two provided similar input, with victim two saying he feared Garcia may return to the residence to retaliate.</p>\n<p>As references in the report, Garcia’s parents described her as “a good kid, trustworthy and very responsible,” adding they were unaware of Garcia having any issues involving alcohol or drugs. The references also expressed certainty that Garcia would appear in court and abide by conditions of release.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s bail was posted at $100,000, but Judge Clifford Anderson reduced it to $50,000 after the pretrial. Kromer posted bail and was released. Kromer was denied an own recognizance release “due to lack of reference input and unverified personal information,” according to the OR/BR report.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s father said in the report that she had “control” issues with alcohol and she “periodically uses marijuana.” Kromer’s mother cited past alcohol and drug use, not including current usage, and said the subject is in need of counseling. Kromer’s mother described her as “dependable, loyal and responsible” but said she is not currently taking her medication and is “headed down a bad path.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/feb/08/three-arrested-alleged-iv-baseball-bat-robbery/\">reported</a> that in court Monday, public defense attorney Mark Owens claimed Kromer received no medications during her time in jail. In response, Hoover said “there are several procedures in place when an inmate is booked at the jail and at no time was there ever any indication that there was medication that was prescribed to her. The first time the jail knew of this issue was during court.”</p>\n<p>The University was unable to provide a comment regarding the academic status of the students after the incident.</p>\n<p>Hoover said there is a possibility that drug involvement is a factor in the motivation for the robbery, but the case is under investigation.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing for Garcia, Kromer and White will be held Feb. 24 at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>*This article has been updated from its original form to protect the privacy of a subject of this article</em><em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Audience members also had the opportunity to submit questions to the candidates prior to the forum.</p>\n<p>Here are the main points discussed during the forum:</p>\n<p><strong>Candidate Backgrounds</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown was first elected as sheriff-coroner in 2006 and subsequently re-elected in 2010 and 2014. He began his career in law enforcement in the Bay Area, later transferring to Inglewood and becoming a police chief for Moscow, Idaho, where he oversaw the city and the University of Idaho. He was also the chief of police for the City of Lompoc in 1995.</li>\n<li>Lt. Hsueh has worked in SBSO for 31 years. He’s led initiatives to provide officers trainings on responding to people with mental illness and trained over 700 officers in two years. Hsueh said he wants to improve training to teach officers to use less force and implement more crisis de-escalation training.</li>\n<li>Lt. Olmstead has worked in SBSO for 28 years and has worked in every division in the department, including the narcotics and human trafficking units. He is running on a platform of repairing relationships with the county board of supervisors.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_83337\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1473520250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83342\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83337\" data-attachment-id=\"83337\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/sheriff-candidates-talk-platforms-in-isla-vista/sheriff-7254/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sheriff-7254\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83337\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sheriff-7254.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83337\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left to right, sheriff-coroner candidates incumbent Sheriff Bill Brown, Lt. Eddie Hsueh and Lt. Brian Olmstead discuss police-resident relations and sexual assault policies in Isla Vista. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Responding to Cases of Sexual Assault in I.V.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said officers should treat survivors with dignity and compassion, as if they were members of their own family. The department does not have a single rape kit that has not been processed, Brown said.</li>\n<li>Hsueh said SBSO could benefit from referring victims to both Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, formerly the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, as well as implementing green dot and implicit bias training. Green dot training teaches people to be an active bystander in preventing sexual assault.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said he believes law enforcement could provide more education to the public about where victims can report sexual assault cases, as jurisdictional issues can be confusing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Police-Resident Relations During Large Events in I.V. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said future large events in I.V. such as Deltopia should only be for local community members because the majority of crime and citations during these events are linked to people from out of town.</li>\n<li>Hsueh suggested SBSO work with the CSD to create sanctioned events that minimize crime through crisis stabilization units and through triaging those suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Hsueh has been on the “front lines” of riots and said police often did not act in accordance with their training because they did not give ample notice before using their weapons.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said more alcohol-free daytime events could decrease the rates of crime and medical transports because alcohol is a main source of problems during I.V. events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three candidates unanimously expressed support for medical amnesty for overdose victims and those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Hsueh, in particular, expressed support for written policies that would show the public that the department’s emphasis is to protect their lives. Under these new policies, those seeking medical attention for illegal activities like drug use or underage drinking would not be arrested.</p>\n<p><strong>Candidates’ Perspective on I.C.E. Requests</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, who has previously complied with I.C.E.’s requests, said he would continue to comply with requests to give the agency the release dates of violent criminals.</li>\n<li>Hsueh was the only of three candidates to state that he would stop complying with I.C.E.’s orders, which he said was necessary to improve “public trust.”</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the immigration system currently needs “comprehensive reform” but said the department needs to follow the law and focus on removing violent people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concerns Over SBSO Lack of Personnel</strong></p>\n<p>The three candidates said one of the department’s pressing needs is its lack of personnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown said the department has lost approximately 90 positions funded through the county’s general fund since 2008. He said the department has cut programs in non-emergency areas and lost several specialized units and crime prevention programs, but he hopes to bring back those programs incrementally.</li>\n<li>Hsueh agreed with Brown’s position.</li>\n<li>Olmstead said the county has paid $4.5 million in overtime as a result of vacancies.
