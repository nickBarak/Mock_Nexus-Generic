Gordon said one of the fundamental problems in evaluating the dropout problem is the lack of conclusive data and inconsistency of the results.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the biggest problems is that we don’t have a system for tracking students,” Gordon said. “We really don’t know the graduation rate. All we have is estimates. They’ve been working on it for years and years and years.”</p>\n<p>Professor Russell W. Rumberger, a prominent high school dropout researcher and CDRP director, said educators are interested in early indicators signaling potential dropouts. He said middle schools and junior high schools usually fail to report poor academic performance of students to high schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>“One of the best predictors [of dropouts] is if they’re failing in middle school,” Rumberger said. “We could do a better job preventing dropouts by looking at kids early on and seeing if we can do something about it before they get to high school.”</p>\n<p>Gordon said that students require more guidance through their educational years.</p>\n<p>“Good programs are ones that provide support,” he said. “It could be a teacher or it could be a counselor. Kids need connections with caring adults.”</p>\n<p>One program, UCSB’s Upward Bound, aims to encourage middle school and high school students in Santa Barbara County to attend college. It also provides services to UCSB students coming from disadvantaged families. On May 15, Congresswoman Lois Capps promised $400,000 in federal aid to support the program, which is currently stationed in a small trailer near South Hall.</p>\n<p><b>Encouraging Diversity</b></p>\n<p>In spite of these attempts to alleviate the situation, some professors have resorted to creating their own intervention programs to resolve the dropout crisis, which many feel has a direct effect on campus diversity. In response to the lack of minorities on campus, College of Creative Studies professor Caroline Allen launched a program to get local kids involved in summer art classes on campus.</p>\n<p>Allen said the CCS Summer Arts Institute offers writing, painting and photography classes to local students who may be the first in their family to attend college.</p>\n<p>In addition, Allen said the No Child Left Behind Act has had a detrimental effect on high school arts programs, as teachers are given less discretion as to the curriculum they choose to teach, and some instructors elect to only teach the material presented on standardized tests, which affects the amount of funding each school receives.</p>\n<p>“They have the five-paragraph essay shoved down their throats,” Allen said. “[Here, they] learn to have fun with their writing and be more expressive.”</p>\n<p>Alli Miarkiani, a former student of the summer institute, said the freedom of the CCS course pushed him to improve his own writing.  He said instructors used unique methods to motivate students.</p>\n<p>“They said, ‘here is a famous piece of writing, see if you can use this as an inspiration for your own writing,'” Miarkiani said. “My writing improved dramatically. It was amazing.”</p>\n<p>Allen said she hopes this program will encourage her mostly Latino students to consider college, especially UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said courses such as Allen’s a step in the right direction in trying to attract more minority students to UCSB. According to the CDRP website, Latinos are twice as likely as whites to drop out of school. Rumberger said schools must begin to cater toward the needs of Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Developing English language proficiency is critical to their success,” he said. “I don’t think there is a single best model, but clearly we need to do a better job at educating our Latino students.”</p>\n<p>Allen said universities and high schools need to inspire students to continue their education.</p>\n<p>“Bringing students on campus is an important step,” Allen said. “They need to know that good things happen here and they can be a part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, some instructors say other factors may explain why minorities do not come to UCSB. According to Black studies professor Dr. Gaye Theresa Johnson, UCSB is not considered a friendly environment for black students. Johnson also said that although more minorities are being accepted into UCSB, fewer students are enrolling, in part due to recent fee hikes.</p>\n<p>“The reason that they’re not coming is because fees are going up,” Johnson said. “[It’s] not just fee increases, but cutbacks in financial aid and increases in loans, but not in grants… Fee increases are an example of higher education becoming more elitist.”</p>\n<p>Just last week, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed a 7-10 percent increase in fees for the UC campuses as part of his 2007-08 California State Budget revisions.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the rise in previous black student acceptance rates is misleading.</p>\n<p>“Even though more black students are eligible for college, black economic disparity compared to white privilege makes black communities more embattled,” Johnson said. “It looks like [black students] have more access, but disparity in wealth is greater than it has ever been.”</p>\n<p><b>Socioeconomic Impact</b></p>\n<p>In addition to pinpointing the real dropout rate, CDRP aims to examine the economic and social costs that high school students who fail to obtain a diploma impose upon society. The new studies being produced will highlight common characteristics of potential dropouts and predict high school graduation statistics.</p>\n<p>Currently, the effects of dropping out have been shown to affect earnings, crime rates and even life expectancy, according to one study. In Fall 2005, Teachers College, Columbia University found the following: A high school dropouts earn about $260,000 less over their lifetime than their counterparts who earn diplomas. High school dropouts also live 9.2 years less on average than people who graduated high school. In addition, increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for all men ages 20-60 would save the U.S. up to $1.4 billion per year in reduced costs from crime.</p>\n<p>According to the California Dropout Research Project website, dropouts are incredibly costly to California, and are more likely to seek welfare support, commit crimes and become incarcerated. In fact, more than 80 percent of California’s prisoners, in 2005, did not graduate from high school, costing California taxpayers $35,000 for each inmate per year. The CDRP also asserts that dropouts suffer from poor health and are more likely to require public health support.</p>\n<p>The Public Policy Institute of California deemed that with the ongoing trends, twice as many high school students may drop out by the year 2025.</p>\n<p><b>Outreach and Preparation Programs</b></p>\n<p>In regards to programs that attempt to ensure graduation and further education, Gordon ok said Advancement Via Individual Determination, an in-school academic support program for grades 4-12 that prepares students for college, is extremely effective.</p>\n<p>“[A.V.I.D. is] a teaching plus a counseling program,” Gordon said. “Their success rate is phenomenal. The figure is 84 percent who get admitted into college and 100 percent who graduate the High School Exit Exam.”</p>\n<p>While Gordon said college outreach programs are often misdirected. He said the programs advertised the benefits of a college education instead of assisting parents and student throughout the application process.</p>\n<p>“I think the outreach stuff is misplaced,” he said. “We do not need to convince [students] that it’s important go to college. Until you help families navigate the bureaucracy, they don’t have a chance. Filling out forms is completely foreign to them. The families had no more idea about how to get a college application or financial aid than to be an astronaut.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s own Student Initiated Outreach Program, which prepares K-12 students to succeed in college, strives to increase underrepresented student populations on college campuses by encouraging a “college-going atmosphere.” Among other programs, their services include group visits to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Third-year Asian American studies major and current SIOP chair Tuyen Nguyen said the committee gives funding to student groups who work with high schools to encourage student success.</p>\n<p>“[The student groups] describe a project proposal and the student organization,” Nguyen said. “They bring hundreds and hundreds of students on a outreach day to give the students an idea that education in college is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Over 15 student organizations are represented on campus including Hermanos Unidos, Black Student Union and El Congreso. They bring students on campus to attend cultural and historical workshops as well as to classes that discuss the required curriculum they will need to complete in order to secure admission.</p>\n<p><b>Barriers</b></p>\n<p>However, some high schools don’t even offer the classes UC schools require.</p>\n<p>Sheilagh Polk, media relations manager for Community Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works to help south L.A. residents, said the Fighting for the Future program is working to ensure local schools provide the necessary classes.</p>\n<p>“A number of students weren’t eligible to attend a Cal State or a UC university because they were missing a math or science requirement,” Polk said. “It wasn’t because students didn’t want to take these classes, but they weren’t offered.”</p>\n<p>One such school is L.A.’s John C. Fremont Senior High. In addition to missing requirements, Polk said its students score significantly lower on their S.A.T.s.</p>\n<p>At Fremont, between 2004 and 2005, the average score was 352 for Verbal and 368 for Math, totaling 720 out of a possible 1600. That puts its participants in the bottom 10 percent of all test takers.</p>\n<p>The newest version of the S.A.T., implemented in 2006, now includes a writing portion on the exam worth 800 points, which brings the perfect score total to 2400 as opposed to the previous 1600.</p>\n<p>According to Collegeboard.com, the 2006 mean S.A.T. scores for college-bound seniors were 503 for Critical Reading, 518 for Math and 497 for Writing totaling 1518 out of a possible 2400.</p>\n<p>The averages for UCSB’s incoming class of 2007 are 616 for Critical Reading, 636 for Math, and 614 for Writing, totaling 1866.</p>\n<p><b>Exit Exams</b></p>\n<p>Being eligible to attend college is one issue; being eligible to graduate from high school is another. 2007 marks the second year that the state will require students to obtain a passing grade on the California High School Exit Exam in order to graduate.</p>\n<p>Polk said students should graduate from high school if they pass their classes.</p>\n<p>“I am against the CAHSEE exam because I feel it is unfair to punish them for 12 years of inadequate education,” Polk said. “They can’t pass a test they weren’t prepared for.”</p>\n<p>However, Gordon said most of the students who do not pass also lack the required credits, and would not have graduated anyway. He said in Sacramento, only 3 to 4 percent of students were denied a diploma solely because they did not pass the CAHSEE.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said that while the intentions behind the CAHSEE are good, poor implementation hinders the program’s success. Instead, he suggested the state offer differentiated diplomas – degrees based on varying high school and testing performance, so that all students who take required classes and pass would receive a degree. He said schools could then identify exceptional students by issuing higher-ranking diplomas.</p>\n<p>“I think the idea [of the CAHSEE] is good but the way it is being done is not so good,” Rumberger said. “The idea of assessing how much kids know by two subjects, math and English [is flawed]. If a kid scores one point less than another kid, should they not get a diploma? It seems so arbitrary.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-29/universities-get-schooled-by-rising-dropout-rates/","id":3278,"author":{"id":341,"name":"Lee Desser"},"related":[3277,3276,3275],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":341,"name":"Lee Desser","biography":"Not available","articles":[3278],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UC Gains $4 Million in Funding for Summer Financial Aid","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1-2.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students who qualify can use the additional aid beginning this Summer Session A. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a victory for the Coalition for a Better UC, Gov.

If the funding is enough to cover their balance, or if the student does not have a balance, students will receive the remaining credit in the form of a financial aid refund,” he also clarified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will be disbursed in the same way other financial awards are distributed — through a student’s BARC account — Quiroz added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office is still waiting on “official guidance from the UC Office of the President regarding awarding practices on individual campuses” and more information about how much of the $4 million will be allocated for UCSB, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The allocations for this summer will be tied to historical Cal Grant allocations, and we hope to learn what UCSB’s share will be soon,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiroz also expressed excitement about the funding and gratitude toward CBUC for the organization’s work over the past two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without their extraordinary effort, this additional funding would have not been made available to our students,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that this funding is the first step toward ensuring that Summer Cal Grants will become a reality in the next year or two.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional summer financial aid allocation is not the same as the Summer Cal Grant Bill, Amy Rose, policy analyst at the California Budget and Policy Center — a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Sacramento — emphasized. Rose focuses on studying higher education issues and has “closely followed and researched” various financial aid proposals, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose was the one to clarify to the CBUC that the funding was not technically a Summer Cal Grant Bill, but instead provides summer financial aid to the UC and CSU and is given to students based on Cal Grant eligibility.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), whereas the budget’s “summer financial aid” funding flows directly to the UC and CSU,” she said in an email. “In addition, Cal Grants are available to students at California Community Colleges and the private institutions, whereas the budget’s funding is restricted to students at UC and CSU.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, students could use their Cal Grant aid during the summer, although there is a cap on a student’s lifetime eligibility that may leave them ineligible for that aid in the future, Rose said. The new summer aid means students won’t have to draw from their Cal Grant to cover the costs of summer classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget allocation differs in that it provides money directly to the UC and CSU to distribute but is still based on Cal Grant eligibility, Chikukwa explained. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of SB 106 is left vague, giving most of the discretion to the CSU and UC campuses on how to distribute it, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose said that one reason for the vague language was to give the universities the ability to work with their own institutional aid programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s possible that the ambiguity was to allow room for both institutions to distribute aid through their existing programs (which have their own goals, criteria, etc.),” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose also added that previous versions of the bill allocated funding solely for tuition and fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[T]he new spending plan does not use that language so it is unclear if this summer aid will be used for tuition and fees or for living costs such as housing and food, which many low-income students struggle to afford,” Rose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, who has been working toward securing additional summer financial aid for students since Fall Quarter 2017, said that while there was a lot of excitement after CBUC’s</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForABetterUC/posts/1476519299140032?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCv8FnYqJItuzzrHm4xgmt5zBz-bEYkdecwdLS8i1QIqCFJ7BeYnclayQs2J6G48l24KvLi-l9AIC5snV-miZjhQsSqiHS9zhp7zY4IGKQ4Wc5CSBntDJvFTHeIkL94WEflllosVMWyIrja1Us5iurUyrephO22Wp-EA1qg1cYsBJdkIXOhRqE3_tOZskfiS0ZcHk23IsD0s_Zy1XoBCrCIY-nWu88RqeXiPM2dscxYXfAWs8DG6v4A053h9o2n2x0LlME2bWnvdPvpwjXqZOiw7gnRrA_XsiJnKo0gQhyHtpZUt0Z3gjjf8XK1c9okEdL7XBOuuEk9ImOA2ANll-9ofg&amp;__tn__=H-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this morning, there were still a lot of questions, too, which is what he and other members of the coalition are now working to clarify. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBUC has focused its efforts on the Summer Cal Grant Bill for the past two years but has been working on various other projects behind the scenes as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the Coalition is there is no specific thing you can say, ‘This is all we do.’ We do a bunch of different things … it was always, ‘We need to be flexible to do whatever we think is the most necessary thing,’” Chikukwa said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he is now the “retired chair,” as he jokingly referred to himself as, Chikukwa has high hopes for the Coalition’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know [future Coalition members] are gonna be better than us,” he said. “And when I say better than us, I mean in the sense that they’re gonna do whatever they do, in a manner that’s better than the way we approached our problems, because they got to see a lot of our failures. They got to see a lot of our successes, also.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa noted that most of the members of CBUC are underclassmen or are entering their junior years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daevionne Beasley, incoming director of internal affairs for CBUC and Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, said the work the Coalition did would not have been possible without the support of individual students and various student groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This work for summer financial aid was really a testament to the work that can happen through collaboration and reaching out to entities with institutional power. It may seem daunting at first, but it’s such a powerful and underrated way to get things done,” he said in a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa also attributed CBUC’s success to “all the students who either signed a petition, called, lobbied, retweeted, shared” or engaged with their social media in any way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That, I believe, was the tipping point. It was a grassroots movement, and there was a lot of people, so many people at the table who made this happen outside the Coalition for a Better UC.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: [6/29]: A previous version of this article said that SB461 did not make it past the Committee on Higher Education; the story is updated to clarify that the bill was paused once the budget ask looked like the better avenue to pursue.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Sir said she has spoken to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez about the app and plans to work on its implementation throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to focus on bringing A.S. out of the dark ages and making sure that entities, all the resources, are [available] in one app,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also plans to secure a permanent location for the A.S.

I’m not looking really for people who have experience in A.S., because I didn’t even have any coming in,” he said. “One of my interview questions is, ‘What is your perception of A.S., and how would you like to alter that?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley’s priorities going forward are ensuring that summer conferences are organized in a timely manner, which especially helps with saving costs, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conferences are over, he plans to start laying the groundwork for his office’s work in the fall so they can hit the ground running. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing I’m really, really wanting to focus on is supporting incarcerated people now and people who were formerly incarcerated, so I’ll be working really hard with my federal policy analyst and statewide policy analyst to see just what is the UC’s role in private prisons,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley wants to ensure that his office has its timeline sketched out early on in the year so it can get as much done as possible, noting that a yearlong term isn’t very long at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his outreach both to students and student organizations already on campus, as well as to incoming first years, Beasley plans to prioritize in-person presentations.

The markets would be community spaces where residents could sell and showcase their art, beauty products and other handmade items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ornelas, the current climate for local markets consists of “a bunch of folks who are really passionate about [art] and kind of just make a Facebook group and have to shell out their own money to sell it at these [markets].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to create the infrastructure for a space where folks can go showcase and sell their art,” Ornelas told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “My vision for that is kind of like a bimonthly or monthly farmer’s market type of thing funded by A.S.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from his desire to create a new local market, Ornelas’ work as an off-campus senator led him to spearhead the development of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/a-s-senate-creates-committee-to-address-mold-in-i-v-residences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mold committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, which surveyed I.V. residents to gain a better understanding of the number of residences with mold infestations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For my last class survey, which garnered about 45 responses, it was really alarming to see that 43 out of 45 people are affected by [mold].

past year and that needs to absolutely change on both sides,” Adam told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The eye rolling, the laughing … the disrespectfulness and the feelings that are created to where certain senators feel like they’re not meant for this role … that’s not how I want any of my senators to feel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam, now a fourth-year political science major, plans to hit the ground running when Fall Quarter 2019 begins by filling the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/senate-votes-to-open-applications-for-ccs-on-campus-senatorial-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two empty</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senate seats, holding training sessions for senators  and facilitating better engagement between senators and the campus at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate held its first meeting on May 22 with only 23 senators instead of 25, as an on-campus senatorial seat and College of Creative Studies senatorial seat remained unfilled after Spring Quarter elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the beginning of her term, Adam was also responsible for the appointment of Off-Campus Senator Tianna White as first Pro-Tempore and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman as second Pro-Tempore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the immediate goal of fulfilling the empty Senate positions, Adam said her focus will be on training senators in the beginning of the fall quarter as opposed to winter quarter, which is when Adam herself was trained when she was a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators [from the 69th Senate] weren’t provided with any sort of training, whether it was on the association, microaggressions — literally any training until the middle of winter quarter… our first half of [the 69th] Senate was just whether or not you had an in with Steven [Ho, former IVP], and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” Adam said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t come in magically knowing anything once you’re elected. So [I want to hold] trainings early and often so that all of the senators are on a level playing field and are able to [perform to] the best of their abilities… [and] have the best resources and knowledge to create change and do the projects they want to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of Adam’s over the course of her term is for senators to change the way they interact with their respective Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As IVP, Adam “serve[s] as the official overseer and reference for all interactions between the Senate Liaisons and their BCU’s,” and must “train the Senators in how to be liaisons,” according to A.S. Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam told senate liaisons during their May 29 meeting that they should strive to “individualize” their approach to BCUs by working “smarter, not harder” to address the needs of each organization individually.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Converting the restrooms, located by the Associated Students offices and the Graduate Student Association Lounge, only requires changing the signage on the door. Gary Lawrence, director of the University Center (UCen), said he hopes to have the signs installed by July 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCen Governance Board worked with Dwayne Mosbey, program coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), to learn more about the process of converting the bathrooms and the potential costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey was invited to speak at a UCen Governance Board meeting in May as a representative of the Trans Task Force, which has been advocating for more all-gender restrooms on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My purpose in going [to the meeting] was telling them what the steps have been with [the RCSGD] in the conversion of multi-stall restrooms, especially because there is no written policy within the UC code about how that is to be implemented, and we just recently finished the conversions for the Social Sciences and Media Studies building,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1732\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal Restroom Access Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, approved by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, requires all single-stall restrooms in a “business establishment, place of public accommodation, or state or local government agency” in California to be marked as all-gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the bill does not address multi-stall restroom conversions, Mosbey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey, along with RCSGD Director Craig Leets and UCSB Policy Coordinator Jennifer Lofthus, has been working on an outline for a UCSB multi-stall bathroom conversion process to facilitate more conversions in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also addressed the board’s concerns about renovations to add more stalls, which he said weren’t necessary to have the restrooms converted. The total cost of converting the restrooms is about $300 to $350, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs associated with single-stall restroom conversions are typically covered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services, but Mosbey said the office did not want to cover the costs for multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the board is still considering renovations to the restrooms, Mosbey cautioned against renovations, noting that they take much longer than signage changes and could create animosity toward people who identify as transgender or nonbinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey is sitting on a special advisory committee over the summer to discuss what renovations would be necessary, if any. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD has been directing its efforts on bathroom conversion projects throughout this past year, with a focus on converting multi-stall restrooms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey’s first step was to update the </span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AGRmap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-Gender Restroom Map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which details the locations of all-gender restrooms on campus. He is also working with the Department of Geography to signify all-gender restrooms on the new interactive campus map the department is working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s next priorities are identifying all the single-stall restrooms on campus that still need to be converted and working with different departments on campus to convert multi-stall restrooms in their buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey said that department heads and vice chancellor hold the power to approve these bathroom conversions. The multi-stall bathroom conversion in the Social Sciences and Media Studies building was the first multi-stall conversion the center helped facilitate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to get an all-gender restroom in every building on campus. But a realistic timeline of that, it could take up to years, depending on how many kinds of barriers we run into, whether departments actually end up agreeing to doing it,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
