While both victims were able to escape, DeAngelo “evaded capture,” according to SBSO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Dec. 30, 1979, two people were murdered in their residence near Goleta, according to a SBSO press release. Two people were also found murdered in a home that they had been housesitting near Goleta on July 27, 1981, the press release stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we commence the charging and prosecution of DeAngelo, this too, will be a team effort involving many jurisdictions working collaboratively and collectively together,” Ventura County District Attorney Gregory Totten said at a press conference held by the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his brother’s death, Harrington struggled to “bring DNA in California to the forefront of forensic crime scene investigation tools.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, he appeared before the Assembly, the Senate and Public Safety Committees in Sacramento, working to appeal to them about using DNA in their investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To the entire reservoir of victims out there, my sadness is with you. For the 51 ladies who were brutally raped in this crime scene, sleep better tonight. He isn’t coming through the window,” Harrington said at the press conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said that while not all of the crimes linked to DeAngelo were purely based on DNA, they are all believed to be tied to him by “his modus operandi or by DNA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, DeAngelo is suspected to be responsible for crimes across 10 counties: Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, Yolo County, Contra Costa County, Santa Clara County, Alameda County, Santa Barbara County, Ventura County and Orange County. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The board motioned to authorize the general manager to request funding from the university to cover the program.</p>\n<p>The finalization of the MOU encountered a minor hurdle during the meeting due to concerns about the contract phrasing which stipulated the investigator “be the primary point of contact for all such investigations occurring within the boundaries of the District.”</p>\n<p>A representative from the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) who was present during the meeting reported that the language in the MOU would create an interference with services and jurisdiction of the SBSO.</p>\n<p>“We just need to work through this to make sure we are not subverting the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff and that we are not supplanting the services that are already provided by the Sheriff as it relates to these investigations,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Brianna Conway countered their concerns, saying the inclusion of the term “primary point of contact” provided an essential element to the position of the investigator.</p>\n<p>“What that does is tell survivors that the first person they tell [their] story to is gonna be the person that stays with [their] case throughout the duration… and really provide that continuity in care in that response,” Conway said during the public comment period.</p>\n<p>Several I.V. CSD directors agreed with Conway’s suggestions, adding that these were consistent with the intended model of the program.</p>\n<p>However, UCPD would be in charge of implementation of such policy practices during the operalization of the investigator position, according to I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have pushed for the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator in I.V., including Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), C.A.R.E, UCPD and the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Members of SASA who were present at Tuesday’s meeting were glad to see the fulfillment of a program that was under discussion for over a year.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long conversation… We’re very happy to see that the needs to the community and the need for the localization of the resource being finally represented in the MOU,” SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also expressed similar sentiments of both hope and happiness at the long-awaited implementation of an interpersonal violence survivor service in Isla Vista</p>\n<p>“This will be successful. This is really about serving our community, making it a safer place and us, Isla Vista’s local government, saying that we believe survivors, that we stand with survivors and that time’s up,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Right before making the official motion to finalize the contract, Bertrand recounted the I.V. CSD’s first meeting, in which an attendee shared her experience of being a survivor of sexual assault in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The most important comment that I heard that night was… about the experiences of so many survivors in this community and it’s those experiences that really make me happy that we’re taking this action here,” Bertrand said, tearing up during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“There’s too many people getting hurt in this community. There’s no perfect way to solve it but this is a really good step and I’m just grateful that we’re taking it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

(SBSO) responded to a report of battery near Highway 101 in the Arroyo Quemada area west of Refugio State Beach on April 15.</p>\n<p>A 63-year-old Santa Paula resident was sitting in a parked car near Refugio State Beach at approximately 1 p.m. when a male suspect attacked him with a guitar, police said.</p>\n<p>Police said the suspect allegedly attacked the elderly man because he believed he was homosexual. The male suspect shouted homophobic slurs during the attack, police said, and the victim was hospitalized with a “traumatic injury.”</p>\n<p>Police spoke to the victim when they arrived on scene and launched a several-week-long investigation to identify and locate the suspect thereafter.</p>\n<p>Police ultimately identified the suspect as Daniel Joseph Garcia, a 19-year-old I.V. resident. After obtaining a court warrant, SBSO deputies searched Garcia’s I.V. residence but were unable to locate him.</p>\n<p>Deputies then obtained an arrest warrant and found that Garcia was in custody in Monterey County. Several hours after the elderly man was attacked on April 15, California Highway Patrol arrested Garcia in Monterey County on unrelated charge of assault with a deadly weapon and driving under the influence.</p>\n<p>Police said on Friday that they plan to transport Garcia to Santa Barbara County to face charges after the disposition of his Monterey County charges.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-07/police-arrest-isla-vista-resident-for-alleged-hate-crime-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-07/police-arrest-isla-vista-resident-for-alleged-hate-crime-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-07/police-arrest-isla-vista-resident-for-alleged-hate-crime-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-07/police-arrest-isla-vista-resident-for-alleged-hate-crime-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-07/police-arrest-isla-vista-resident-for-alleged-hate-crime-2/","id":3743,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3742,3741,3740],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
