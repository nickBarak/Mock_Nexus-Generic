Culminating in today’s final face-off, the Cougars put up three-consecutive scoring innings, and held the Gauchos offense to one hit and no runs after the bottom of the fifth. However, it was not enough to overcome five Gauchos’ runs scored earlier in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We had a little bit of a defensive bobble for the first time in the series,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were trying a little too hard, and we just needed to throw more strikes. We had a lead and we had to make them beat us.”</p>\n<p>Starting the game on the mound for the Gauchos was junior left-handed pitcher Domenic Mazza after an ankle injury during Thursday’s practice pushed his original Saturday morning start to Monday’s game. Mazza allowed five hits for two runs and recorded one strike out in 5.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Mid-game was good, the first inning was rough but I got through it,” Mazza said. “The next two innings went by pretty quick; my defense played well behind me.”</p>\n<p>Mazza was the start of a long list of pitching changes, as the Gauchos played five pitchers, ending with junior righty reliever James Carter who logged his second save of the season in his 2.1 innings pitched. In total, the UCSB pitching staff only allowed seven hits to the Cougars.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been around for four years, and so I know these guys and their pitches,” senior catcher Campbell Wear said. “It’s good for guys to get in during the first series, and get some nerves out from the beginning of the season.”</p>\n<p>Of the five runs scored, redshirt senior right fielder Luke Swenson went 2-4 with three RBIs, leaving him with a .500 on-base percentage this weekend in his 12 plate appearances. Junior first baseman Dalton Kelly accounted for two of those runs scored.</p>\n<p>“We left some pitches up, and they took advantage of that,” Wear said. “We kept saying in the dugout ‘We still have the lead, let’s finish this.’”</p>\n<p>BYU sophomore center fielder Brennon Lund who went 2-5 and put up two RBIs. In addition, the Cougars’ senior reliever Brandon Kinser allowed only one hit to UCSB in his two innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Next up, the Gauchos will face Kentucky who also ended the weekend undefeated against Ball State and Richmond and who will play USC during the week.</p>\n<p>“I’m feeling confident [against Kentucky], we’ve got a great group of guys out here,” Mazza said.­ “I feel like we’re going to do well this year.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will face the Wildcats at home for a three-game series at home starting Friday at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/baseball-finishes-off-opening-series-with-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/baseball-finishes-off-opening-series-with-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/baseball-finishes-off-opening-series-with-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/baseball-finishes-off-opening-series-with-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/baseball-finishes-off-opening-series-with-sweep/","id":4720,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4719,4718,4717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos and Bruins Tie in 12 Innings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB and UCLA tied after 12 innings of play due to darkness coming over Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Yesterday was a missed opportunity for the No. 24 UCSB baseball team.

With runners on second and third base, UCLA managed to earn the game’s first run with a single, followed by a two-run RBI that chased Vasquez from the game. UCLA would put up one more run after the pitching change as Vasquez was charged with all four runs despite allowing only three hits in total.</p>\n<p>“His stuff wasn’t very good. I think he was a little flat,” Checketts said. “His command was just okay. He didn’t have great stuff today. The ball wasn’t coming out of his hand very good.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began clawing its way back into the game by scoring a run in the bottom half of the inning. After a walk and double that put two runners in scoring position, UCLA retired the next two batters but allowed a run on a fielding error that brought UCSB within three runs.</p>\n<p>Down 4-1 in the third inning, the Gauchos tied the score with one swing of the bat. With two runners on base, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa smashed a three-run blast over the right field fence for his team-leading ninth homerun of the season. It was his first since April 4 after he went a stretch of 37 at-bats without hitting one.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to get something up in the zone, something elevated,” Kuresa said. “We had a runner on third with one out; I was just trying to hit a sac-fly and not a double play. I was pretty surprised he gave me a fastball there. He missed over the middle, and I put a good swing on it.”</p>\n<p>The tie did not last long as UCLA manufactured a run in the next inning against sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza, who came in relief for Vasquez. Mazza allowed a runner to reach first base, resulting in a successful steal of second after. The Bruins capitalized with another single to take the lead once more.</p>\n<p>Now trailing, Santa Barbara remained persistent on offense and managed to tie the game once more. With consecutive hits to put runners on first and second base, junior shortstop Peter Maris advanced to within 90 feet from the plate on a fly-out. In need of a clutch hit, freshman center fielder Andrew Calica delivered with an RBI up the middle to complete the 5-5 comeback.</p>\n<p>“We got some toughness,” Checketts said. “We’ve been down because the starting pitching hasn’t been very good this year. So we’ve been chasing runs quite a bit and have had a lot of situations like that. The guys definitely did a good job of coming back.”</p>\n<p>With 10 runs combined through the first five innings, the game from there on turned into a battle between the bullpens. After Mazza pitched an efficient 4.1 innings, allowing only one earned run, Checketts handed the ball over to junior Greg Mahle. Mahle retired the first three batters faced in the seventh inning and had a quick eighth inning to end his appearance.</p>\n<p>Despite not scoring for the rest of the game, the Gauchos did have opportunities to break the deadlock. UCSB put runners on the corners in the sixth inning for senior left fielder Joey Epperson, the team’s leading hitter. However, Epperson came up empty as he popped up to the shortstop to end the inning. In the following inning, the Gauchos failed to bring in Kuresa from third base after junior outfielder Scott Quinlan struck out looking with two outs.</p>\n<p>UCSB used just four pitchers for the entire game, including using sophomore closer Dillon Tate for the final four innings. Tate was on point in his appearance, striking out four batters on only 56 pitches. His combination of fastball and sinker kept UCLA from scoring.</p>\n<p>“I give all the credit in the world to Dillon,” Kuresa said. “He pitched a good game and they couldn’t do anything against him, too.”</p>\n<p>After 12 innings of play and with night starting to become a factor, the umpires called the game as a 5-5 draw.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its biggest series of the season against first-place in the Big West UC Irvine beginning this Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/","id":4717,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4716,4715,4714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces BYU in Series Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baseball_vsBYU-20150214-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baseball_vsBYU-20150214-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Baseball enters series finale versus BYU today with three games won in this four-game series.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60923\" style=\"width: 738px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baseball_vsBYU-20150214-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"281020533\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60936\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60923\" data-attachment-id=\"60923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/clay-fisher-prepares-to-swing-at-a-pitch-from-byu-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baseball_vsBYU-20150214-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Clay Fisher prepares to swing at a pitch from BYU.

After a walk, and a base hit by senior catcher Campbell Wear, a hit by pitch loaded the bases. An RBI base hit by Calica brought home Campbell as the go-ahead run. The Gauchos’ second run scored that inning went down as an unearned run on a BYU passed ball.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a good time to sit back on a pitch that I could handle well. It’s awesome to see that we had some good team at bats earlier that inning,” Calica said. “Good things happen when you get lead off guys on.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore right-handed pitcher Shane Bieber allowed only three hits and one run while striking out nine in eight innings pitched in his season debut during Saturday’s late game. Combined with ninth-inning sub-in, junior right-handed pitcher James Carter, the team allowed BYU only four hits.</p>\n<p>“It was a weird situation going in with a double-header, but I went in there trying to treat it as a normal start,” Bieber said. “I tried to get comfortable with my pitches as I went on, and I ended up getting more and more comfortable with each inning.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in Saturday’s morning 6-0 shutout, junior right-handed closer Dillon Tate started in place of junior lefty Domenic Mazza, allowing three hit and no runs, with eight recorded strikeouts in 25 batters faced through 6.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“Tate’s usually our closer, but he really did a good job,” Checketts said. “He was really in control of that game. He had a great start and was dominant for those innings.”</p>\n<p>At the plate, UCSB’s lineup swung for twelve hits and six runs scored. Junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic recorded two of the teams four total RBIs, with three hits and one run scored. Redshirt senior second baseman Woody Woodward and senior catcher Campbell Wear made up the other two RBIs with one a piece.</p>\n<p>“We were good early, but they’ve given us a lot [of runs] defensively. Even today, they gave us one on a pass ball,” Checketts said. “We’re going to have to earn more of our runs, than have them give them to us.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s season opener, the Gauchos kicked off their winning weekend in front of a crowd of 411 attendants. UCSB allowed twelve hits turning into only one run for the Cougars, as the Gauchos capitalized for eight runs on 10 hits from across the lineup.</p>\n<p>The teams had Sunday off after Saturday’s double-header to prepare for today’s game. With the threat of going home empty handed in its first series, BYU must improve on its four errors made in the past three games.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure the guys will come out and run around on their own to make sure that they’re ready,” Checketts said. “The big thing is it Domenic Mazza will be able to throw for us. That’s a big question, is if he’s ready to go.”</p>\n<p>The teams will play today at 1 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for the last game of the series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/ucsb-faces-byu-in-series-finale/","id":4718,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4717,4716,4715],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Continue To Discuss Isla Vista Self-Governance","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Students, Isla Vista residents, Santa Barbara County officials and university administrators gathered Tuesday night at Assemblyman Das Williams’ stakeholder meeting in the I.V.

Clinic building to discuss the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) to facilitate self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), introduced in December to create a CSD for I.V. by act of the state legislature, will be amended to include more detailed plans for the proposed special district before it will be voted on. Tuesday’s meeting was part of a series of meetings that have been hosted by Williams to establish and clarify the bill’s language regarding the creation of a CSD. During this Tuesday’s meeting, stakeholders discussed the extent to which students should be allowed to be involved in self-governance, whether or not county representatives should be on an I.V. governing board and the events of last weekend’s Deltopia festivities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he is in favor of having self-governance representatives from both the university and the county holding positions on a governing board for the CSD.</p>\n<p>“I want the cooperation of UCSB and the county. Basically, I want their advice,” Schunk said. “That’s a big part of it for me. There are a lot of complicated things that we want to do with this CSD and I think that both entities have expressed that they might be comfortable with an ex officio seat.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said any group with an interest in I.V. governance can run a candidate for the board.</p>\n<p>“If there’s other entities … that have a real concern about what’s happening at that level, they’re going to find a candidate and they’re going to put their support behind that candidate,” Soutar said. “That is the electoral process and I don’t know if we need to make it super complicated.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD board member and fourth-year global studies major Jacob Lebell said the university and county’s support will be necessary to form a governing board.</p>\n<p>“In the position we are in now, we need both the county and the university to have support for the board,” Lebell said. “Our interests are not always going to be aligned with it but we need their support for the board to come into existence.”</p>\n<p>Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr, said Farr’s stance on the proposed governing board will not be stated until Williams’ final version of the self-governance bill is signed into law.</p>\n<p>“What I see is her [Farr] waiting until the government signs it [AB3],” Aguilera said. “When that’s signed she will decide whether to endorse it or not. I think as it stands right now she’s undecided.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said the two organizations he is a member of, the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee and the UCSB Foundation Board of Trustees, are in favor of I.V. self-governance, but are awaiting to see what the final plans are before endorsing the stakeholders’ plans.</p>\n<p>“Those two very big players at the university are committed to a process that brings greater self-governance for Isla Vista,” Thurlow said. “What’s not clear I think is, ‘What is that? What form does that take?’ And we’re still not sure what exactly the chancellor can do vis-à-vis a piece of legislation. There’s still some huge questions that aren’t answered. … Finances and boundaries and board makeup.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman said he is frustrated with the university and county’s allegedly non-committal attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re all being asked these questions: ‘What boundaries do you want?
