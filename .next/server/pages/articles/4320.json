The Matadors come into this game with a solid overall record of 22-10 but a disappointing 1-5 conference record. They have lost six of their last eight games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Any team in conference is a quality opponent.” Junior pitcher Shane Bieber said. “We just have to take it slow and keep on playing Gaucho baseball.”</p>\n<p>The biggest advantage that UCSB holds this weekend is the fact that it is back to playing at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. It currently boasts a 13-1 home record and has the best winning percentage of any team in the Big West at home.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we are in Santa Barbara it feels good. This is a great place.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, the matadors have yet to win a conference game on the road. In order to pull off the upset, CSUN will need to call upon its play that had them start the season 20-4 at one point.</p>\n<p>Some of its big time players include junior infielder Fred Smith who leads the team in batting average (.352), hits (50) and at-bats (142).</p>\n<p>With six home runs each, senior Brandon Berry and sophomore Albee Weiss are tied for first on the team in home runs and are both tied for second in the Big West conference. Berry also leads the team in RBI (24).</p>\n<p>Another big factor going into the series will be pitching, more specifically, for Friday CSUN will hope to see a great start from Kenny Rosenberg. The redshirt sophomore has been on a tear since coming back from his injury last season boasting a 4-1 record.</p>\n<p>Rosenberg has registered a 2.68 ERA after allowing 16 runs and 17 hits in over 50 innings pitched. He leads the Big West and is tied for second in the country in strikeouts with 70.</p>\n<p>Although the redshirt sophomore has had a solid season, facing the Gauchos is never an easy task. They are led by sophomore Austin Bush who has been having a great season as he leads he team in hits (31), RBI (24), and slugging percentage (.522).</p>\n<p>“I have gotten some good hits, clutch hits.” Bush said. “But this is a team and we are all doing great, love these guys.”</p>\n<p>Other great hitters for UCSB include redshirt sophomores Josh Adams who is the team’s designated hitter and second baseman J.J Muno. Both players are tied for first on the team in home runs with four.</p>\n<p>Another player who looks to have a big Friday night is pitcher Shane Bieber who has been the teams starting Friday pitcher all year, an honor that he has taken great advantage of.</p>\n<p>“In the offseason its all our [pitchers] dream to be the Friday pitcher.” Bieber said. “Im very happy to be that guy and I’m glad to have this team take the field with me.”</p>\n<p>“He’s very fun to watch.” Checketts added. “He’s always in control of the plate and that is a good quality.”</p>\n<p>It makes sense that a pitcher who has great control of the plate would have a solid 6-1 record this season. The right-hander also leads the team in strikeouts with 42 and has the best ERA among starting pitchers on the team with a 3.18.</p>\n<p>However, what makes Bieber a true threat is his composure. Three times this year, Bieber has allowed a home run in an early inning, and each time has rallied to pick up a victory for himself and his team.</p>\n<p>“I have a great team behind me so I’m always confident.” Bieber said.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend is another big one for the Gauchos. Winning Big West games is never frowned upon and if they want to continue the great season they are having and hope to win its first Big West championship in a long time, they cannot afford to blow any conference games.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is a conference championship.” Checketts said. “we are going to try our hardest to achieve that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Friday, April 15<sup>th</sup> against CSUN at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s and Sunday’s game are at the same location but at 2 and 1 p.m. respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Their request to the county to use the Solar Lot on Embarcadero Del Mar as alternative parking was also rejected.</p>\n<p>CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said after identifying that the university was financially responsible for the fencing on El Colegio Road as opposed to the Santa Barbara County, the board put in a request with the university to avoid putting up fencing in response to the demands of the community.</p>\n<p>“We put in the request and essentially never heard back,” Brandt said. “A couple of us, myself included, feel very disillusioned by the fact that the university is not willing to listen to a bunch of concerned community members.”</p>\n<p>University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said fencing had been installed on El Colegio Road despite the motion that the CSD passed.</p>\n<p>“In the interest of public safety and traffic concerns, and in consultation with county officials and law enforcement, the decision was made to once again use the fencing during the weekend,” Estrada said when asked why the CSD’s request was denied.</p>\n<p>University Board appointee George Thurlow referenced two incidents in Santa Barbara in which pedestrians were killed in car accidents while jaywalking to explain why the university and UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) chief of police were adamant about installing the fences.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the discussion, it was concluded that that fence needed to be there, and if it saves one life, then it was worth it,” Thurlow said.</p>\n<p>The board had previously contacted the university to ask about the cost of fencing and were only told that it was a “substantial amount of money,” according to Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes the university is keeping the figure under wraps because the high price tag would upset residents who already oppose the fencing.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s disheartening because we do a lot of work to try to change the character of these events and make them so they are more community-based so that they are something that is safe for all community members,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said there are better alternatives the university could promote, such as UCIV, a student-run volunteer program that has been developed in the past three years.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he believes UCIV would be able to “ensure that the event is safe on a peer-to-peer level in a way that law enforcement has failed to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen a volunteer program just spring up out of nowhere, totally student-led, that really wants to try to dull down the number of people that are interacting with law enforcement, that are being arrested and being cited,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt also spoke about the importance of peer-to-peer relationships between students and CSOs, saying he felt the motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station during Deltopia is a positive step.</p>\n<p>He said he believes it’s important for the CSOs to be the “eyes and ears” of the community during events like this, when residents might not feel comfortable approaching law enforcement personnel with critical information.</p>\n<p>Plans regarding the creation of alternative parking for residents living on Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road and Trigo Road were halted after the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department rejected the board’s request to use the Pardall Solar Parking Lot, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He also said the County was “concerned about the loss of revenue” if the parking lot was used by residents of impacted streets for free.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said the board was working with Transportation &amp; Parking Services in order to create alternative parking, particularly with concerns for students who use their cars to get to their jobs.</p>\n<p>Originally, it was assumed that only Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road would have restricted parking. Brandt then found out on April 4 that parking on Trigo Road would also be controlled and that parking would not be permitted within 100 feet of the barricades.</p>\n<p>“There’s certain areas where we put no parking, like Trigo Road. The vehicles there will get towed because that street is going to get shut down,” Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Lieutenant Juan Camarena said. “Everywhere else our recommendation is not to park, but if you park we’re not going to tow it like last year.”</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the city of Goleta, all vehicles in the area from Hollister Ave. to the southern city limit and from Cannon Green Drive to Storke Road without an approved permit will be subjected to a ticket. Parking lots on campus will also be restricted. Daytime parking will only be available for vehicles with the appropriate permits visible; vehicles parked on campus overnight without proper authorization will be impounded and given a $300 fine.</p>\n<p>Both Lieutenants Camarena and David Millard of UCPD attended the Deltopia town hall last month. At the town hall, Lieutenant Camarena said the UCPD and IVFP planned to closely monitor social media and adjust the amount of law enforcement present during Deltopia accordingly.</p>\n<p>Millard and Camarena said that they were not aware of any such monitoring when asked about efforts regarding plans to observe social media platforms for any posts related to Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say that I actually even heard that they were doing it this year,” Millard said.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP currently have no plans to adjust the projected level of police presence during Deltopia, regardless of the weather, according to IVFP Deputy James McKarrel.</p>\n<p>“Rain or shine we will be staffed because it’s easier for us to reduce our units if we don’t need them then to bring them in if we do need them,” McKarrel said.</p>\n<p>Camarena estimated that there may be “around 60 to 70 officers” out during Deltopia, but could not give an exact number.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be similar to last year,” Camarena said.</p>\n<p>Millard also could not give an exact number of officers and said the department won’t know how many they will deploy until the day of the event because “officers may get sick or have family emergencies.”</p>\n<p>Camarena also said IVFP would not bring in horses during Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year as a lieutenant for Deltopia, and the whole thing for me is just another day for us,” he said. “We just need to make sure that people are safe.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

sandwiches and tater tots. Founder Dave Danhi hopes to host community events at the new store. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The store will offer a wide variety of grilled cheese sandwiches and tater tots.</p>\n<p>Founder and Chief Creative Officer Dave Danhi said that he has wanted to open up a physical location for some time and that the location in I.V. “kind of fell onto our lap.”</p>\n<p>“The [I.V.] location came to us through a friend, who actually now has become our partner because he was so happy with the concept,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>“The prior owners of the place just didn’t do well and wanted out, so they left and it became available. When I came up and looked at it, I automatically saw ourselves there,” he added.</p>\n<p>The Grilled Cheese Truck began serving Los Angeles in 2009 in a single truck. The business has since expanded to include three trucks that serve customers from Santa Barbara to Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Following the opening of the I.V. location, Danhi plans to expand truck services to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and open a second physical location in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Danhi also hopes to sell franchises in the distant future.</p>\n<p>Despite the location itself having been previously occupied by short-lived tenants such as a Korean BBQ restaurant and a burrito place, Danhi said that the universality of grilled cheese will attract customers to the store.</p>\n<p>“Grilled cheese is something that I feel everybody has a connection to, usually from their childhoods,” he said. “It’s the epitome of comfort food … so it always brings back good memories.”</p>\n<p>Danhi also noted the enthusiastic responses in I.V. he has received so far as a reason to believe in the store’s success.</p>\n<p>“As we’re setting up the location, we have people stopping by every half-hour asking if they can order already,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>He plans on getting the community involved in various ways, such as holding a variety of contests and special events.</p>\n<p>“We had our first training session recently, and some of the kids had some great ideas for special nights that we might do, like Pajama Night or Greek Night,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>Other proposed ideas Danhi mentioned include featuring a sandwich made by a customer as a special on the menu and naming the sandwich after them.</p>\n<p>He also wants to hold fundraisers and raise awareness for different causes for the clubs and organizations of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The new store will be located at 956 Embarcadero del Norte.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 22, 2018 iissue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81455\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/grilled-cheese-truck-to-open-restaurant-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81455\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/grilled-cheese-truck-to-open-restaurant-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/grilled-cheese-truck-to-open-restaurant-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/grilled-cheese-truck-to-open-restaurant-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/grilled-cheese-truck-to-open-restaurant-in-isla-vista/","id":4319,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[4318,4317,4316],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
