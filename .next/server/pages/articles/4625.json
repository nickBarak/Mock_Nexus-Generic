IVCRC additionally reached out to local restaurants to cater to the event, such as Ike’s Place, Silvergreens and Blaze Pizza, altogether expanding the tasty range of amenities the carnival had to offer.</p>\n<p>Spudnuts Donuts drew in crowds with free donut bites, green tea boba and coupons for their next visit, nestled among the herds of passing students.</p>\n<p>“The main goal of the event is to start off the year with all of the community united,” said Jennifer Kim, external chair of IVCRC. “It isn’t closed off just to UCSB students; we aim for the families in the community to come out and enjoy the fun as well!”</p>\n<p>Organizations outside of USCB took advantage of this opportunity, inviting students to get to know the resources available to them beyond the campus in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Acacia Counseling and Wellness, for example, had a colorful board of post-its near the ferris wheel that carnival goers could add to. Students circled the board to write words of encouragement to share with their fellow peers, putting them on display to pass on to the next person in need of a positive pick-me-up.</p>\n<p>Ruby Aranki, a fourth year student and administrative manager of the organization, said the purpose of the activity is not only to “destigmatize the current notion of mental health but also raise awareness of the current outlets available to serve those who suffer with depression or anxiety disorders.” With their upcoming $1 yoga sessions available to all members of the Isla Vista community, Acacia plans to put all proceeds towards a student therapy fund for those unable to afford the cost of counseling.</p>\n<p>When asked about her impression of the I.V. community thus far, first-year student Emily Hong noted that she loved how the community is so tight-knit and welcoming and the fun extends “beyond the frathouse.”</p>\n<p>“It kind of reminds students that I.V. isn’t all about the party reputation you expect coming into it, and it’s completely avoidable if it’s not your thing,” Hong said. “In my opinion I thought the carnival was a great way to kick off the new year, and with all the food and carnival games there was something fun for everyone to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Kim rested easy at the end of the event she helped organize, noting that although it got hectic behind the scenes, the shortfalls meant nothing compared to the success of the event as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how it all came together the day of and all the happy faces of people coming to the stands, it really made the hard work pay off,” Kim said.</p>\n<p><em>See more at <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-01/in-photos-pardall-carnival-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">In Photos: Pardall Carnival 2016</a></em></p><div

event of the year Thursday which allowed I.V. residents and UCSB students to speak directly with local police about ordinances for Halloween.</p>\n<p>Pizza with Police provides an opportunity for students and residents to meet officers and deputies from both departments to ask questions about local law enforcement in the community. Law enforcement officers addressed concerns about police barricades, amnesty legislation, noise ordinance and Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p>UCPD Sergeant Matt Bowman said the festival ordinance on loud music, which began Oct. 26, will be in place until Nov. 4.</p>\n<p>“The ordinance is if it’s able to be heard from the street, so that means the property line, so police walk out to the street to listen,” Bowman said. “If they can hear it, it’s too loud.”</p>\n<p>According to Bowman, streets will be cleared of cars and police barricades will be in place from 5 p.m. until 3 a.m. on the days surrounding Halloween.</p>\n<p>“At about 3 p.m., they’re going to start towing cars off the street, and, again, that’s to benefit the entire community, because it gets so compacted with people walking up and down the street that those extra cars on the street make it unpassable, and we need to open it up,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said the barricades will not completely block off the roads because some vehicles may need to pass in an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want you to, but if it’s an emergency situation, you may — but, goodness, be careful; there’s a lot of people out there,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>Bowman said it is important to understand amnesty legislation, which protects any individual from being charged for possession if they call emergency services for someone in need of help.</p>\n<p>“Amnesty is legislation … that says police officers will not make arrests in cases where people call to get people medical aid,” Bowman said. “So remove that fear, get that person the help that they need, because the last thing any of us want, I’m sure, certainly all the officers, is for somebody to not get the help they need when they’re intoxicated or overdosing or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Bowman also said UCSB’s costume policy bans students from wearing masks on campus, and wearing them in I.V. may make things more difficult for officers.</p>\n<p>“If you are detained by an officer, they do have the right to identify you if they have reasonable suspicion or probable cause, so you may be asked to remove it to verify who it is under the mask,” Bowman said.</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Julio Gutierrez said he expects Halloween this year to be tamer than in past years.</p>\n<p>“I think that after the riots, the community has done a very good job of keeping it low-key, keeping it a more localized event,” Gutierrez said. “I know a lot more students this year are against having outsiders come in. For the most part, they’re doing their part.”</p>\n<p>According to Gutierrez, starting the music ordinance at 6 p.m. will help prevent problems as the night progresses.</p>\n<p>“Because the Halloween event is one that is known to attract a lot of outsiders, what a lot of people do is they tend to party during the day and come out to the streets at night,” Gutierrez said. “If you party during the day, drink alcohol during the day, by the time night time comes around, people are intoxicated, they make poor decisions, inhibitions are thrown to the wind, then we have the problems in the latter part of the night.”</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement officers are present to ensure safety, and Halloween is no different from any other night.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to ensure that if someone is intoxicated to the point where they can’t care for themselves, that they’ll have someone watch out for them,” Gutierrez said. “Unfortunately, watching out for them in that state means taking them to the hospital or to jail. People drink; sometimes they go overboard. As long as everybody’s safe and no one gets hurt or injured, then, for us, that’s a good night.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Kim Fryslie said the best way for students to make sure they are not breaking laws is to understand them. Fryslie recommends students to Google “SB County ordinances” and look on the county page at the following link: <em><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc\">countyofsb.org/lawsregulations.sbc</a></em></p>\n<p>“I think a lot of the problem in Isla Vista is that the information is presented to the students in such a way that some find it not very comprehensive, and this site will be helpful to those who want to know exactly … how they can safely follow the rules,” Fryslie said.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said law enforcement and students have the same goal for Halloween celebrations.</p>\n<p>“I think a perfect night for us is we come out here, we patrol and we don’t have to arrest anybody or write any tickets,” Gutierrez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/pizza-with-police-addresses-halloween-expectations/","id":4622,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4621,4620,4619],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former UCSB Student Receives 6-Month Sentence for Rape","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-12-at-4.28.54-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-12-at-4.28.54-PM.png?resize=980%2C578&ssl=1","description":"A female UCSB student filed a report to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on June 28, 2015, saying she had been sexually assaulted.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A former UC Santa Barbara student was sentenced to six months in jail on Monday for the rape of a female classmate in June 2015.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shuhei Nakata, 22, was charged on two felony counts of rape by use of drugs and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexual penetration by foreign object. He will serve six months in Santa Barbara County Jail with five years of probation, and he may be deported to his birth country of Japan due to the nature of his conviction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The female UCSB student filed a report against Nakata to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on June 28, 2015, saying she had been sexually assaulted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nakata’s probation report, the assault occurred two days before when the woman had gone to dinner with him and several other friends. She said in the report that she had two to three beers over a period of two hours, and she and her friends then went to Nakata’s house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata poured shots for the group at his house and gave the woman one to two shots of an “unknown alcoholic beverage,” the report states. She later told law enforcement officials that she blacked out and had difficulty recalling what occurred afterward, but she remembered walking home with the defendant and three other males.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her roommates said in the report that Nakata stayed behind after the three other males left and went to the woman’s room saying that he had left his shoes there. The roommates later forgot he was still in the house and only recalled his presence when another roommate heard two people having sexual intercourse in the woman’s room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The roommates knocked on the locked door when they heard the sounds, the report states, but they did not receive any response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the woman woke up the next morning, she felt pain in her genitals and she found </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her pants in the room with the button and zipper still closed, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the report. She also stated that the amount of alcohol she consumed should not have caused her to black out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 1, the woman agreed to speak with Nakata on the phone. He apologized multiple times and said they had “hooked up for a little bit” and “it led to sex.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been weighing on me a lot because … you probably were completely blacked out later on and that was absolutely not okay to happen,” he said to her on the phone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakata told her that he realized it was “definitely not okay” when, during intercourse, the woman called him by the name of another friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On July 2, 2015, Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested Nakata at his house. He then admitted that “I did keep going for a little more” after she called him the wrong name. When asked if the woman would have engaged in sexual intercourse with him if she was completely sober, Nakata replied, “Honestly, probably no.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In light of that, I probably took advantage of the fact that you were very intoxicated, and that is what I’m very sorry for,” he told the woman during their phone call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman had known him since September 2014 and had never been in a sexual relationship with him.

Pardall Center to provide the community with food and information on local resources.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Resource Fair is a public event which will feature several different organizations, including Committee of Student Well Being (COSWB), I.V. Food Co-Op, Department of Public Worms, Health and Wellness and Environment Affairs Board. The organizations will offer information about their resources, answer questions and host free food giveaways.</p>\n<p>IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim said the Resource Fair will bring people together in I.V., which is the goal of IVCRC.</p>\n<p>“As IVCRC, our goal and intention for having this committee to begin with is to bring this community together — bring everyone together — and I think the Resource Fair is a great way [to do so],” Lim said. “Not just for UCSB students to know what resources are available for them, but because it’s in I.V., we can have families come, and different people around the community come.”</p>\n<p>Lim said the event will inform attendees of the resources available to them provided by multiple I.V. and UCSB organizations.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people don’t know what’s available to them, and to have this [event] and present it to them in one day, in one space …” Lim said. “I’m excited for it to become a really big part of what we do as a community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and third-year art and sociology double-major Aimee Hanna said she is looking forward to the event and what it can offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“This event is about feeding people, letting people know all about the resources that are available to them and allowing for these things to become accessible,” Hanna said. “It’s for folks to really come together and realize how we can all come together to make a better community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC secretary and third-year psychology major Tai Kang said A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen inspired the decision to host the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“When Aimee and I first got our positions in IVCRC, we were really interested in food security,” Kang said. “I suggested it to Aimee because I read a bunch of articles on food security, so we went to the Food Bank, where we met Tuyen, and she was the one who gave us the idea for the Resource Fair.”</p>\n<p>According to Kang, Nguyen asked IVCRC to take on the project because A.S. Food Bank lacked the time and resources.</p>\n<p>“We have all the student lock-ins and the fees to do so, and it’d be a great resource to the students,” Kang said. “I think that big thanks has to [go to] Tuyen because she was truly the one who inspired us to do this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the I.V. Resource Fair has been in the works for some time, though it has been unsuccessful until now.</p>\n<p>“It was something that some of our previous leadership wanted to do last year, and we started to do a couple resource fairs with some community folks to begin to look at and model,” Nguyen said. “Something that already exists in the community, such as the Healthy Food pantry provided by the Isla Vista Youth Projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Nguyen, A.S. Food Bank met with IVCRC over the summer, during which the committee chose to pick up the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re super thankful to them to put forth their resources and attention,” Nguyen said. “They are amazing and they’re actually the lead; we’re here to actually just be a partner in their particular project.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said A.S. Food Bank will provide food at the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“Our role would be to help support and provide pantry items,” Nguyen said. “We have a variety of produce that folks can sift through, but this is a way in which we can provide a different access.”</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental science major Colleen McCamy said she is looking forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a really cool event,” McCamy said. “[It’s] helpful for students to explore the different resources here in the community and on campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66171\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66171\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/","id":4624,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4623,4622,4621],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
