Getting off to a slow start is nothing new for the Chargers, who began each of the last four seasons 2-3.

The Chargers currently have the #1 rated offense and the #1 rated defense, in terms of yardage per game. Seems weird, right? How can a 2-4 team have the best offense and best defense in the league?</p>\n<p>The answer is inconsistent play on the road and poor special teams. Special teams are like breathing. You take it for granted when it runs smoothly and only give it attention when it falters. Yet it is vital to your success.</p>\n<p>San Diego has allowed six non-offensive touchdowns this year — 42 out of 126 points the team has allowed. Furthermore, Chargers punter Mike Scifres has had three punts blocked. Before this season, Scifres had one punt blocked in 393 career attempts.</p>\n<p>This is why the Chargers’ defensive achievements may be skewed.</p>\n<p>Philip Rivers is a stud and Antonio Gates and Malcolm Floyd have played well, but football is a team sport. The Chargers — who made drastic offseason moves — lack many of the playmakers that have helped them overcome poor starts in years past. The squad cannot expect to come from behind to win the division every year, especially with key players missing.</p>\n<p>On defense, the San Diego aggressive and blitzing scheme of years past is all but dead. With linebacker Shawne Merriman, defensive tackle Jamal Williams and cornerback Antonio Cromartie gone, the San Diego defense is hurting. Here are the quarterbacks that have beaten the Bolts this season: Matt Cassel,  Matt Hasselbeck, Jason Campbell and Sam Bradford.</p>\n<p>When you play against young, inexperienced or mistake-prone quarterbacks, it is thought that you should move around on defense to show them various looks and eventually they will make a mistake. But the Bolts have been unable to disrupt quarterbacks. They will need to do so in the coming weeks when they face the likes of Tom Brady, Matt Schaub and Peyton Manning if they hope to turn this season around.</p>\n<p>All of this puts more pressure on the offense — a.k.a. Philip Rivers — to dominate. And he has. The offense has actually been great, but only because of great play from a few players. Football is a team sport, where a single weak link in the chain can be identified and exploited. The group is not without fault.</p>\n<p>Rivers was sacked a career-high seven times against the Rams, a team that had 10 sacks coming into the game and finished 30th in the league last year. Additionally, the Chargers have lost nine fumbles, a league-high and already two more than all of last season. The over-hyped Ryan Mathews has two of those fumbles. It’s safe to say the Bolts are missing LT right about now, and that LT — who is seventh in the league in rushing for the 5-1 Jets — is not missing them.</p>\n<p>In Week 5, the Chargers lost on the road to Oakland, snapping the 13-game winning streak San Diego had over the Raiders spanning over seven seasons. Oakland? Oakland!? Please type in “We Lost to Oakland” on YouTube. That about sums up San Diego’s season thus far.</p>\n<p>Much like the 49ers, one big thing the Chargers do have going for them is a weak division. It remains to be seen if the division-leading Chiefs are for real, and the Raiders and Broncos are not intimidating, let alone experienced.</p>\n<p>So if history tells us anything, it would be foolish for me to bet on the Chargers to win the division. Ultimately, the NFL is a quarterback-driven league, and San Diego has one of the best in the business. While Philip Rivers is very capable of leading his team to another division, it won’t happen this year. History also tells us that it is extremely difficult to dominate a division for this long, and this may be the year the Chargers falter.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Ryan Porush gets off to a slow start sometimes, but always comes storming back.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27707\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/sunday-funday-chargers-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27707\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/sunday-funday-chargers-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/sunday-funday-chargers-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/sunday-funday-chargers-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/sunday-funday-chargers-suck/","id":2809,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2808,2807,2806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush","biography":"Not available","articles":[721,733,736,737,740,754,756,757,759,761,764,774,780,783,784,787,788,791,792,793,796,799,800,806,810,811,813,821,822,824,834,839,841,907,1235,1736,1743,1745,1759,2282,2291,2301,2303,2789,2809,2826,2893,2895,2896,3496,5511,5515,5518,5522,5526,5527,5528,5532,5535,5537,5538,5539,5541,5545,5546,5553,5554],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Of the three clubs requesting funding, the Black Student Union (BSU) received the full request for $4,300 from the Culture and Graduation budget. The Queer People of Color Collective and Active Minds did not receive funding. The committee also granted a request to reallocate funding for an upcoming Sigma Pi Epsilon fraternity fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Black Culture Week co-chair and second-year black studies major Mikayla Williams said BSU’s Black Culture Week event will kick-off with a barbeque May 18 and include several cultural activities, including a film screening, spoken word night and candlelight vigil to remember Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese-American human rights activist and a member of Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity.</p>\n<p>“Tuesday [May 19] is actually the birthday of Malcolm X so we will be holding an event commemorating his birthday as well Yuri Kochiyama’s, with a candlelight vigil to honor them,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A.S President Ali Guthy also presented the President’s Agenda and said the Academic Affairs Board budget has been cut due to its recent merge with the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>In assessing the allocation of funds for Queer People of Color Conference and Active Minds, A.S.

They always draw well, but there will definitely be a lot of people there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A lot of people for Davis, though, is not a lot of people for Santa Barbara. Harder has already held three matches this season with over 6,000 fans — two of which had over 10,000 — a record among all Division I soccer programs in the country. Possibly as a result, it took the Gauchos until this Sunday in Riverside to defeat a home team outside fan-and-tortilla-filled Harder.</p>\n<p>“Playing outside the confines of Harder without the crowd, without the atmosphere, it’s not easy to get yourself up for these games sometimes,” senior defender Michael Boxall said. “But we’ve thrown enough games away on the road that we have to approach each game the same way we would Duke or UCLA because these are all big games.”</p>\n<p>With just four matches left in the regular season, all of them against conference opponents, UCSB has only a handful of chances to secure a top seed in its conference tournament in November. Currently, the Gauchos are on top of the Big West, ahead of UC Irvine (3-0-1). Davis is tied with Cal State Fullerton in third place with a conference record of 3-2.</p>\n<p>“How we won [in Riverside], being down a goal right off the bat and being down 3-2 with 20 minutes left gives you a real big boost of confidence,” Vom Steeg said. “It helps to kind of carry you through the season when you have to fight like that. Every one of these games is tough for us, and the road games are even harder because of our crowd and the energy, so we’ll have to bring that energy tomorrow night.”</p>\n<p>One source of energy for the Gauchos will be junior midfielder Danny Barrera, who has registered 265 minutes out of a possible 270 in the team’s last three matches. In those matches, he scored two of the Gauchos’ three game-winning goals, including a 75th-minute blast that solidified a 4-3 win for UCSB against Riverside.</p>\n<p>“He fits in with the rest of the players now,” Vom Steeg said. “We kind of found the right spot for him on the field and know how to get him the ball in that position. Danny is playing well but it’s a function of the team playing well too.”</p>\n<p>UCSB leads the Big West in goals, shots, points, assists and corners so far this season, out shooting opponents 104-41. Against an Aggie squad with a win streak of their own, tonight’s game could be a struggle.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7:15 p.m. tonight before UCSB welcomes Cal State Northridge to Harder Stadium on Saturday night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27715\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/chos-push-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27715\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/chos-push-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/chos-push-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/chos-push-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/chos-push-win-streak/","id":2807,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2806,2805,2804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Flex Decisions for Flexible People","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In fantasy football, the most common dilemma for an owner is who to start in a given position week in and week out.

This means that while they certainly cannot earn you a win by themselves, they will also not hurt you so badly that you will lose because of them.</p>\n<p>I like to start running backs in the flex position. Unlike wide receivers (who can only earn you points if they receive a significant amount of targets from their quarterback), a starting running back, or even one who is in a time share with another back, is usually guaranteed around 15 touches per game. He may not have a huge day, but he will have the opportunity to earn you enough points to push your point total.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Seattle Seahawks’ running back Justin Forsett. Although officially designated as the team’s starting running back, Forsett has so far been sharing his job, first with Julius Jones, and now with Marshawn Lynch. Despite this unfortunate fact, Forsett has still been averaging just over 12 carries per game, which has translated to over 60 yards per game the last three weeks for an average of over seven fantasy points per week. While it’s not spectacular, it’s also not horrible, and if that yardage is accompanied by a touchdown — as it was in Forsett’s last game — it can mean another six points and a very respectable fantasy day.</p>\n<p>Another example is Chicago Bears’ RB Matt Forté, who despite playing in the pass-first offense of Mike Martz, has been able to average nearly 13 fantasy points per week on an average of fewer than 12 carries.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to start a wide receiver at the flex position, be sure to start someone who gets enough targets to be useful every week, no matter the matchup. Normally, this will end up being a receiver who plays out of the slot position, because quarterbacks trust those receivers to get them out of tight spots. Since every quarterback gets into trouble several times a game, slot receivers are usually targeted often enough to make up for the fact that they don’t get many yards.</p>\n<p>Patriots’ wide receiver Wes Welker is the quintessential flex receiver. Tom Brady trusts him to get open when he needs him to, and so looks his way often in a variety of situations. This trust has led to 33 receptions for Welker so far, setting him on pace for 106 by the end of the season. Because Welker gets targeted so often and has so many receptions, he can be counted on to provided solid fantasy numbers week after week, as can other receivers like him.</p>\n<p>The key to success at the flex position is consistency. While they may not get an enormous amount of touches per game, they get enough work that fantasy owners can hope for at least some points each week. Consistency is exactly what you want out of a flex player, as the flex position is for players who can be trusted to provide enough points to cover your big game players, who tend to be more boom or bust, on days when they, well… bust. Whether you choose to play a running back or a wide receiver, make sure you pick someone you trust not to drop the ball with the game on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick Up of the Week:</strong> While I’d like to recommend Deion Branch, I find it hard to tell people to pick up any Patriots player based off one good week that was probably due to Tom Brady’s tendency to spread the ball around. Instead, I’ll tell you to keep Branch in mind but focus on Detroit Lions’ quarterback Matthew Stafford. When he returns from injury after the Lions’ bye week, he’ll take over an offense that is powered by running back Jahvid Best and wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With his talent and those weapons at his disposal, Stafford could provide a good option for anyone struggling at the QB position. Stafford is still available in 77 percent of leagues, but I have a feeling that’s about to change.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Josh Greenberg flexes his muscles like the running backs and wide receivers at the flex position.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/","id":2808,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2807,2806,2805],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
