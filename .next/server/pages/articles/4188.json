CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said at the launch on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt recalled the first time he visited I.V. with his family and said it was “clear from the beginning that this was a place that was special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was also clear what my parents’ opinion of it was, which was that it’s weird that there are mattresses lying on the corner, and that there’s trash in the gutters,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all know, standing here today, both as folks who have lived in Isla Vista and those who have been coming here for years, that’s not what Isla Vista is really about. But it does say something about the fact that there is a lot of quality of life issues that can be improved here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt hopes to appease these concerns through the use of SeeClickFix. By using the app as a mobile steward, users can help keep the streets of I.V. clean simply with their phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt noted that there’s been a “rise in rhetoric” in the county that has dehumanized houseless people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really think that in Isla Vista, we here can be a model for trying to solve these problems and help them get back on their feet rather than pretending that if we just push things out of sight, out of mind, that the issue doesn’t exist,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who also spoke at the launch Sunday, took a moment to acknowledge Cesar Chavez’s birthday, and the “community building behaviors” that he demonstrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann referenced the <a href=\"https://streetsteam.org/index\">Downtown Streets Team</a> in the Bay Area, which works toward “ending homelessness by restoring the dignity and rebuilding the lives of unhoused men and women,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They first did a survey of homeless people and found that it’s not being cold, it’s not being hungry, it’s being invisible. That’s the hardest thing about being homeless,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this program allows really a triple bottom line: to give people jobs and get them engaged, it makes your community better and it makes each one of us more connected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Lydick, beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista, said the program was going through the final stages of hiring at the moment. She anticipates bringing on five to seven people to work on graffiti abatement and other beautification initiatives in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers on Sunday went to work tackling the first few requests sent in by I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud to clean up the I.V. Community Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud initially utilized SeeClickFix in 2012, when he worked in Associated Students. Back then, he said, the program was much simpler, and there was no designated group working to fix the problems.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working on county issues and trying to figure out how we can make Isla Vista better with no local government back then,” he said. “We’d see what people put in and we’d try to work on them each without a coherent system and without dedicated staff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the I.V. CSD was looking for ways to launch the beautification program, they considered simpler options, like Google Forms, but knew that it wouldn’t give them the ability to collect the data that they wanted to, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they reached out to SeeClickFix, the board found it to be the most effective and reasonably priced option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the district spent approximately $5,700 for a one-year subscription, which included the district with two accounts, one for Abboud and one for Lydick, and the support of the SeeClickFix team in setting up and managing the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service has improved exponentially since Abboud first used it when he was an undergraduate, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before it was [a] very text-based website…I don’t even think it had a GPS,” he said. “It was brand new.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the program is much more user-friendly, he said, and the company has helped the I.V. CSD set up the front end of their app and design a workflow system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud also noted that it has been helpful to hear from the company about how other cities have developed their apps.

Its next seven games will be away from Santa Barbara and it currently holds a 2-3 record.</p>\n<p>Combine that with the fact that Pepperdine is 9-6 at home this year with wins over quality teams such as fellow Big West counterpart Cal Poly, and the Gauchos could be in some trouble.</p>\n<p>The Waves will make it hard for their opponent most notably with their ability to hit the long ball as their 20 home runs as a team this season ranks 45<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s hitting is led by young outfielder, Matthew Kanfer. The freshman leads the team in batting average (.348) and is tied for first in RBI (18).</p>\n<p>Kanfer had a breakout performance two weekends ago as he contributed nine hits, 11 RBI, one home run and five runs scored in four games against Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Other solid hitters include junior infielder Manny Jefferson who leads the team in home runs (5), first in slugging percentage (.585) tied for first in RBI (18), and junior outfielder Matt Gelalich who leads the team in on base percentage (.429)</p>\n<p>In today’s match-up, Pepperdine will most likely throw junior Chandler Blanchard on the mound. The right-hander has had his struggles as he currently boasts a 1-1 record with a 4.61 ERA after allowing seven runs on 13 hits in 13.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The junior will have a tough time as he will face one of the best hitting teams in the country in UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to key players such as recently named Big West Field Player of the Week, Josh Adams, to keep up their strong play. The redshirt sophomore leads the team in home runs with five.</p>\n<p>Adams received POTW honors after a great week in which he batted 5-12 (.417), six RBI, and one home run. UCSB would love to see him carry that momentum into today’s game.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate and the other POTW recipient from a couple weeks ago, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush, will also do his part. The strong hitter leads the team in RBI (21), ranks second in hits (22) and is third in batting average (.328).</p>\n<p>Another player who has caught some fire as of late is redshirt sophomore Dempsey Grover. The catcher leads the team in batting average (.421), hits (24) and on base percentage (.519).</p>\n<p>Possible starter for today’s game in terms of pitching could be freshman Kyle Hatton (2-0). The left hander has done well in limited time registering a 1.29 ERA as he has only allowed one run and three hits while striking out five batters in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>This game, as well as these next seven matches, will be very telling of the Gauchos. Although they have had a great start to the season, they need to be able to prove they can win away from home.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is today against Pepperdine at 3 p.m at Eddy D.

CSD discussed the resolution at several board meetings before it passed on Tuesday. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Resolution No. 19-7 calls for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors to recognize the Chumash people’s historical and ongoing ties to I.V., also known as Anisq’oyo, through an acknowledgement at the beginning of all meetings.</p>\n<p>Anisq’oyo, part of the home of the Chumash people, encompasses the land that I.V. and UC Santa Barbara both reside on.</p>\n<p>I.V CSD staff members and Board President Spencer Brandt worked with Mia Lopez, a representative of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, to draft the acknowledgement and learn more about the heritage of the Chumash people.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just recognizing the past, but acknowledging those of the present and our future. We need to educate our community about the forgotten history that is our history,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also started using a similar land acknowledgement in graduation ceremonies and convocations for new students, according to Lopez. Multiple departments have begun to do the same at the beginning of their meetings as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s just incredibly important, I think, that we can serve as a model for something that local governments can do in whatever small way to try to do our part to rewrite history and not be silencing voices, both of the past and the present,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Annette Cordero, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, explained how vital it is for governing bodies such as I.V. CSD to set an example for the rest of the community to remember the history of the people who occupied it for centuries.</p>\n<p>“It is healing for us. It does our hearts and our souls good to have this kind of recognition. On behalf of our, as we like to say for seven generations, our children and the children yet to come, this will have a meaning for them, so thank you,”  Cordero said.</p>\n<p>The resolution was adopted with a small amendment clarifying that the acknowledgement be recited at all meetings of the I.V. CSD, not just regular meetings. The resolution was passed with a 6-0 vote in favor and was met with a round of applause. Director George Thurlow was absent from the meeting.</p>\n<p>The full acknowledgement of the Chumash people and Anisq’oyo can be read below:</p>\n<p><i>“Before we begin, we would like to acknowledge the Chumash people, who are the traditional custodians of this land. We pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present, and future who call this place, Anisq’oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home. We are proud to continue their tradition of coming together and growing as a community. We thank the Chumash community for their stewardship and support, and we look forward to strengthening our ties as we continue our relationship of mutual respect and understanding.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
