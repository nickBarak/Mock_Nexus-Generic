It was a long off-season, one which featured the departures of thirteen Gauchos — just before the brand new lights of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium shone on grass that was once the home of Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Shane Bieber, whose rise to the top of the game has since coincided quite nicely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the five seniors UCSB waved off, Kevin Chandler and Alex Patterson were the pitchers. Chandler had already spent his first two years of college ball with the Gauchos before Patterson made the switch from San Joaquin Delta College. They pitched a combined 154.1 innings for UCSB. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outfielders Tevin Mitchell and Michael McAdoo are joined alongside catcher Thomas Rowan as the position players who have left their space for the next wave of exciting talent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell and Rowan are both currently playing for the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Marlins, a rookie-level affiliate of the Miami Marlins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With five seniors gone, that leaves eight, who are all playing professional baseball. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack Dashwood, Eric Yang and Tommy Jew all chose red.Dashwood is with the Angels, Yang is with the Reds and Jew is learning the Cardinal Way, out in a town just blistering with excitement after Jordan Binnington’s masterful run with the Blues for St Louis’ first cup. And they’re known as a baseball town too, so it’ll be nice to see him coming up in a great system with a great fanbase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Martinez, Ben Brecht and Shea Barry make up the rest of our Gauchos who have not only said goodbye to UCSB, but to California (for now at least). Martinez is with the Orioles, facing off against Mitchell and Rowan in the GCL. Ben Brecht is with Tampa Bay, playing in Hudson Valley while Shea Barry brought his ball to Houston. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, the locals. Chris Lincoln got picked up by the new-look San Diego Padres, who seem to have built the perfect farm system years into A.J. Preller’s reign as general manager. They look capable of providing a great network and system for Lincoln to thrive in. Armani Smith drove up the 101 just like he’s done the past two years, a native of Martinez, California. He’s playing for his hometown Giants.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Shane Bieber’s an all-star! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here we are, past the introduction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season is officially underway as UCSB has since wrapped up a three-game series last Sunday at Sacramento State 2-1, batting a measly .181 over the entire series. They returned home Monday for the debut of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium’s brand new lights. It was the first night game in program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And their bats were sizzling as they rattled off a .447 clip at the plate to give them a 17-7 win over Cal in a one-off series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the break just about done, UCSB will host their first home series of the season as Abilene Christian University comes to town this weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wildcats hosted Utah Valley for a four-game series in which the Wildcats swept them 27-9 overall. They then hit the road for a one-off against TCU in which they lost 4-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’ll be an interesting series to say the least. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday and Saturday evening games will start at 5:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., respectively. Sunday’s match is set for noon, under what will hopefully be a clear sky after Saturday’s current rain projection. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-62994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Legal Resource Center is located at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Legal Resource Center (LRC) currently has two lawyers contracted as student legal services advisors; the positions provide confidential, privileged legal counseling for students. The student legal services advisor job description, meant to convert the contracted lawyers into employees, was changed from “inform and advise” to “educate and inform,” according to the amended job description, which the Nexus obtained from Sabina Menzhausen, the incoming student unit director for the LRC and a fifth-year biopsychology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that the LRC — located at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista — will no longer offer its protected counseling service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen and last year’s student unit director, Riley Traut, launched a campaign to reverse the university’s changes to the job description and published a Change.org </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nancy-g-hamill-protect-ucsb-student-access-to-privileged-legal-counseling-services-from-the-lrc?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23075573_en-US%3A1&amp;recruiter=724949681&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on June 25 calling for the university to walk back the changes to the job description. As of June 28, the petition has collected 1,762 signatures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offered Robin Unander, the current Associated Students (A.S.) LRC student legal services advisor, the position under the new job description. The other attorney working for the LRC, Ron Perry, said he did not know enough about the negotiations between Unander and UCSB to appropriately comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander’s contract was supposed to expire on June 30, but UCSB extended it to July 10 in order to allow for more time to negotiate the job description</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB does not reverse the contract’s description of the job, UCSB students will be without privileged, confidential counseling at the LRC, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new changes to the job description, students may ask general legal questions, such as how much time a landlord has to return a security deposit, but students cannot obtain legal counsel or case-specific legal advice from the LRC employee. The student legal services advisor must refer them to someone else, possibly a lawyer retained as a vendor by the university, according to Unander.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that the “legal guidance resources” will continue at the LRC, and that the current concerns over LRC services are based on a “false rumor,” but she declined to elaborate further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada’s comments are “confusing” according to Unander, who said that Estrada’s response does not make sense given the job description in the student legal services advisor contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The changes to the job description] give the university, as well as university police, etc., access to these kinds of cases students come in with and that abolishes the integrity of what the LRC stands for,” Menzhausen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This could castrate that service by eliminating [students’] ability to walk in there and consult on their legal issues without fear of being exposed,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nancy Hamill, UCSB chief campus counsel, did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change in the student legal services advisor job description also means that the advisor will become a mandated reporter, an employee who is legally required to report sexual misconduct allegations, and could be compelled to disclose information a student told them to the authorities, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d also have to report if somebody came to me as a sexual assault survivor and they wanted to know their options and their rights, but they weren’t sure if they wanted to proceed legally or make claims. I would now have to report them,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new job description violates the ballot measure which students voted on in 2001 to provide “free legal education and consultation” as a part of the LRC’s mission, according to Menzhausen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen said that the A.S. executive office told her that confidential counseling would remain in place but has not responded to her requests for clarification. However, Menzhausen noted that higher offices, such as the campus counsel, are more responsible for the change in job description than the A.S. executive office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email between Melinda Crawford, a UCSB human resources official, and Unander, Crawford said that the amended job description means that Unander “will not be practicing law in this role,” and that Unander is “not permitted to form an attorney-client relationship with anyone.” This email was provided to the Nexus by Unander’s lawyer, Erin Parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job description was amended in mid-June, when Unander asked for employment benefits such as retirement credits, and that the university pay for her mandatory continuing legal education and annual state bar fees during the contract’s negotiations, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks alleges that UCSB made changes to the job description offered to Unander as a retaliatory act after Unander requested employee benefits. Parks said that UCSB misclassified Unander as an independent contractor and that Unander’s responsibilities under her current job description fall under the legal definition of an employee, thus making her eligible for employee benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a person makes a claim that there’s potential violations of law, and immediately something happens like this, that smacks of retaliation,” Parks said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When an individual says, ‘You’ve been breaking the law, you’ve been violating the law and it’s damaged me,’ and the employer then does something to adversely affect their continuing relationship like, ‘We’re no longer going to let you practice law,’ that’s huge, that’s retaliation,” Parks continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada did not respond to a request for comment regarding these allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks requested that UCSB allow Unander to continue working beyond the June 30 expiration date of her current contract, which allows her to offer privileged counseling at the LRC.  The LRC hopes the extension will allow for more time to negotiate the job description while maintaining the current level of legal service to students, according to Unander, who added that UCSB has not yet responded to that request.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they do not agree to maintain status quo then on July 1 LRC will not be able to function,” she said in a text message to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander has worked with the LRC as an independent contractor since 2003, and since she first joined, Unander said the LRC has provided counsel to at least 16,000 students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander noted that, due to working on behalf of the LRC for over 16 years, she has no private practice to fall back on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the amended job description, Unander would be classified as an official employee of UCSB, rather than an independent contractor, but because she will not practice law in the position, she would not receive the benefits associated with being a practicing attorney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers of lawyers normally reimburse their bar fees, and Unander’s legal counterparts at UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley — who are all employees of the university — have their bar fees reimbursed, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that the updated position does not require that the employee holding it have a law license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that the new rules would present a dilemma for whoever fills the position, since in order to know whether or not they can simply give general legal information or recommend consultation with a lawyer, they need to know what legal problem a student has, which would not be privileged if disclosed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a normal school year, the LRC serves 1,000 to 1,300 students, primarily dealing with issues relating to crime, according to Unander. Students also come to the LRC for housing issues and conflicts between students and their landlords, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LRC also helps students with more serious legal issues. Erick Velazquez Andrade, a fourth-year microbiology major, said he uses the confidential legal counseling services at the LRC to navigate the complex legal web of immigration law. Recently, he used the LRC for help in filling out paperwork regarding his legal status, he told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s imperative that I’m able to stay here in the United States, be able to finish graduating from UCSB,” Velazquez Andrade said. “I wouldn’t be able to have access to an immigration law firm otherwise.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Velazquez Andrade was also one of over 40 tenants who </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/over-40-former-tenants-sued-isla-vista-luxury-living-over-security-deposit-disputes-and-won/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> local landlord Isla Vista Luxury Living (IVLL) over security deposit disputes and won, a victory he credits to the consultations he received at the LRC. Velazquez Andrade said the LRC gave him the necessary tools to present and win his legal argument against IVLL through representing himself in small claims court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that he was able to pay for summer classes with the money he received from that lawsuit, which amounted to $1,020 out of his $1,750 security deposit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen said she worries about students avoiding the LRC in the future out of fear that what they divulge to the student legal services advisor will not be privileged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students are] still going to be paying for the service, but they’re not going to be able to access it and might choose not to out of fear of potential retaliation or consequences,” Menzhausen said. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [June 28, 6:45 p.m.]: A previous version of this article was corrected to refer to counseling as “privileged” or “protected,” not “confidential.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A previous version of this article also incorrectly stated that Unander’s current contract expires on July 1 and has been corrected to reflect the correct date of her contract expiration, June 30. </em></p>\n<p><em>This article was also corrected to attribute the LRC to providing counsel to at least 16,000 students since 2003, not Unander herself.</em></p>\n<p><em>[Updated: 7/1/20, 8:35 p.m.] This article has been updated to reflect Unander’s contract extension. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/lrc-fights-to-retain-confidential-counseling-for-ucsb-students-which-could-disappear-by-july/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/lrc-fights-to-retain-confidential-counseling-for-ucsb-students-which-could-disappear-by-july/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/lrc-fights-to-retain-confidential-counseling-for-ucsb-students-which-could-disappear-by-july/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/lrc-fights-to-retain-confidential-counseling-for-ucsb-students-which-could-disappear-by-july/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/lrc-fights-to-retain-confidential-counseling-for-ucsb-students-which-could-disappear-by-july/","id":4084,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4083,4082,4081],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Case Count in I.V.

The university has “no information on the details” of the fifth case, Yang said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) is responsible for contact tracing for individuals with confirmed cases of coronavirus; the five cases confirmed in the research study have been referred to SBCPHD. It is unclear whether the three cases of coronavirus among I.V. residents announced by Yang overlap with three of the cases recently confirmed by Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County confirmed I.V.’s first case of coronavirus on March 30. Over two months later, the county confirmed the second case of coronavirus in I.V. on June 9.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judges of the 2019 UC Los Angeles Bollywood Fusion dance competition Jhoomti Shaam were about to announce the winners of that year’s competition. But the women of UCSB Taara — a dance team performing South Asian dance styles — had already decided they wouldn’t place at the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were so many amazing teams and we had accepted it. We were like, ‘You know what, we’re going to get last. And that’s okay,’” Natasha Nema, one of the group’s four founding members, said. “We were genuinely fine with getting last because we just couldn’t even believe that we were there in the first place against that many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group had been together for less than a year, and after scoping out the competition, they thought they didn’t stand a chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really weren’t even listening, cause we were like, ‘Oh, we don’t really care. Like, yeah, we’ll listen for second and first, sure. But third place, we don’t really care,” Nema recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the judges announced the winners –– they placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t even comprehend that our name was being spoken, that we just paused for a little bit. And then we screamed, it was like two seconds later,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In less than a year since the group’s inception in June 2018, the four hopeful members became a winning team of 12 in their dream competition. That was in March 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, in February 2020, UCSB Taara took first place at Bollywood Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This June, the four original members of UCSB Taara –– Nema, Shivani Shah, Sejal Chandra and Jashanna Walia –– graduated from UCSB and said goodbye to the group they envisioned, nurtured and led to victory over two years. For those four women, leaving Taara “Gen One,” or what they call the first generation of UCSB Taara dancers, meant leaving a lasting legacy at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have our literal legacy on this campus and a part of us still at UCSB forever, I think, to me at least, is really, really special. It’s like a home you’ll always have when you visit campus and a bond you’ll always be a part of, no matter how old you get,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia recently passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, but they expect to watch the group progress for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t even imagine being old enough to see Taara Gen 10 … It’s changed so much in just two years that I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like in another two years,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in the summer of 2018, the girls buckled down in brand building and recruiting efforts. They decided on their official name –– Taara, which means star in Hindi –– designed a logo, ordered team jerseys and hired a DJ to create a dance mix for their group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema handled the marketing side, which meant legitimizing the team, recruiting new members and defining their style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really wanted for people to take us seriously within the circuit because there were already so many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating Taara, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia were all in other Bollywood or Bhangra dance groups at UCSB but had frustrations with the groups’ leadership. So the four decided to create their own group: a competitive, all-female team that fused the styles of Bollywood, Bhangra, hip-hop and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But starting a new group meant that Taara didn’t have a proven reputation to help recruit dancers. New members would have to take a leap of faith, and the original four had to convince recruits  that Taara could go the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How do we get all these new people to trust us? How do we get these people to commit 20 hours a week, at least, of dancing, to get them to the next place where we can compete and where we can prove ourselves?” Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema took to social media, scouring Facebook pages for incoming freshmen and potential recruits, and even went as far as downloading dating apps. Some of the others made friends with dancers already in the competition circuit, Desi Dance Network, to learn insider tips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At tryouts later that year, Taara accepted 12 new members, bringing the team to 18. But that number was quick to dwindle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally just two days later, girls would start dropping out” due to the time commitments,  Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time their first competition came around, their group was down to a solid 13 members, just one member more than the minimum required to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That year, UCSB Taara competed in back-to-back competitions for three straight weekends. After the first competition, one teammate dropped out on the drive back to UCSB. Now, they were down to 12, and the team had to rearrange dance formations for the next two weekends of competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders said that competition season was grueling for the team. Between balancing school schedules with dance practice, the four struggled to keep the team motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone’s grades are falling, no one is sleeping, everyone’s sick, you’re just practicing in parking lots,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taara didn’t have its own designated space to practice on campus, so the captains had to get creative in finding a space to dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would squeeze ourselves into tiny rooms,” Shah said. “We snuck into the theater building. We snuck into [the Humanities and Social Sciences Building]. We snuck into Rob Gym. We snuck into so many [buildings], just so that we could have some floor to dance on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the next weekend’s competition, Taara placed eighth –– last place. The girls used the week between that competition and their next to rearrange parts of their performance with feedback from the judges. At the last competition that season –– Jhoomti Shaam –– Taara placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning that, not only was it just amazing because it was our dream competition, but I think it finally showed the team that everything we did was for a reason,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team knew at that moment, claiming their trophy, that the tireless hours of practice, sleepless nights and long drives to competitions had paid off. For a team that wasn’t expecting to place at all, taking home third place was more than a victory — it was proof that Taara lived up to its name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a new generation of Taara prepares to take the reign, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia agree that Gen One created a precedent –– and a bond –– that will live on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gen One, especially, everyone just grew so close and over everything, it was just a family. I think even leaving it, I know that everyone’s still going to be a team forever, as cheesy as it sounds,” Walia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was no accident that Taara Gen One became a family since it was one of the group’s first goals when they set out to create Taara. They wanted to compete and impress, but mostly, they wanted to dance with people they loved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were 12 small girls, but we were the loudest girls in every room and we were just having the best time. And I think that like, like positive energy really just attracted others to us,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taara isn’t just a dance team. We’re also people, we’re good people. We want people to know that we’re friendly people and that is part of why we dance. It makes us happy. We want to share that happiness.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
