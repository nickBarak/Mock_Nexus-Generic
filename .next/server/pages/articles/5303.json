At 6’5’’, Kasseff does maintain the capabilities to start for the Gauchos but will not be a replacement for Davis; instead UCSB will rely on the veterans to fill the void.</p>\n<p>“The other guys are all going to be all a little stronger, a little more experienced, a little better and that’s the way that you can kind of replace one guy,” McLaughlin said. “[Kasseff] isn’t necessarily going to be Dylan Davis; he doesn’t have to be, but as long as the other guys around him take another step forward, we can overcome that.”</p>\n<p>In his senior season playing for the Nevada Union, Curtis led the team to a 20-6 overall record and a regular season division title. Curtis will have to battle for playing time despite the loss of Evans as the Gauchos already have depth at the outside hitter position.</p>\n<p>“[Redshirt Jacob Delson] will probably make a push for some time as well as Kevin Donohue, who hurt his shoulder in the middle of the year,” McLaughlin said. “There are a lot of experienced guys returning and its going to be tough for the freshmen to make an immediate impact.”</p>\n<p>Zant is in a similar position as Curtis; the setter will most likely have to play backup to All-MPSF honorable mention Jonah Seif who played a significant role in the Gauchos’ run to the postseason this year.</p>\n<p>With three confirmed recruits for the upcoming season, McLaughlin is still in the works for recruiting transfers, but will limit the roster to 20 players.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to go over a 20 person limit ever because we want to train everyone that’s in the gym at all times and we don’t want to have anyone sitting around,” McLaughlin said. “We lost five [seniors], so we have three [incoming players] and we’re working on a couple of transfers; we’ll see what happens.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, UCSB has evolved into a completely different team in the two month span since the last time these teams played.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht has turned into the go-to player for the Gauchos, recording double-digit kills in his final seven games of the season and leading the team in kills for much of that span. Having only made one total appearance as a substitute in both games against the Anteaters, Licht will add an extra dimension for UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>The game has added meaning for senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. In what quite possibly may be his final game of his collegiate career, Davis, the lone remaining starter from the team that reached the title game two years ago, has guided the team for much of the season and brings proven postseason experience to a relatively young squad.</p>\n<p>The team captain has delivered for the Gauchos throughout the season, posting 1.37 blocks per game and averaging a .438 hitting percentage, ranking third and sixth in the conference, respectively. In the first match against Irvine, Davis was forced to exit from the game early due to injury and could not play in the final crucial moments of the match.</p>\n<p>Sweeping five of its last seven opponents, UC Irvine enters the playoffs as the hottest team in the country and ready to repeat as champions. With the best middle blocker tandem in the league, juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring, Irvine is second in the MPSF in opponent hitting percentage (.238). Kevorken and Mehring come in with a .506 and .484 hitting percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>If that was not enough to contain for the Gauchos, they will also have to account for AVCA National Player of the Year, junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. This year, the Frenchman has averaged 3.83 kills per set and had a total of 32 kills in seven total sets against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/","id":5300,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5299,5298,5297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Davis Named National Blocker of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After four years serving the UCSB men’s volleyball team, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis was honored this past week with the Off The Block/Springbak, Inc.

Despite the individual achievements, Davis still acknowledges the important role his teammates and coaching staff played this season.</p>\n<p>“They were absolutely everything; without them there’s no way I would’ve even come close to getting the numbers I did this year,” Davis said. “The coaching staff and the team — they’ve all been pushing me to be the best player I can be. I think I did that my senior year.”</p>\n<p>This is the second major honor bestowed on Davis this season. Earlier he was selected as an All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team selection, being one of only two middle blockers to be selected for the first team.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be the best I could be and whatever came out of that I gladly accept,” Davis said. “These rewards mean a lot to me and I’m really glad I got them, but these weren’t something I was planning on from the get go.”</p>\n<p>This season alone Davis recorded double-digit kills on six occasions, including a season-high 14 kills against UC San Diego on Feb. 1. Davis had his most complete game of the season while on the road versus USC, where he put up a double-double with 11 kills, 14 blocks and a .500 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Our win against USC — that was one of the games where we turned it around and got our win streak going,” Davis said. “That was one of the bigger games this year.”</p>\n<p>Although his collegiate career might have ended last week after the Gauchos lost to UC Irvine in the first round of the MPSF playoffs, his professional career is just beginning as he aspires to play professionally and for the national team in the Olympics. If he gets there, Davis will be the first one to thank the UCSB volleyball program for helping him get there.</p>\n<p>“Without these guys I don’t think I would’ve become the kind of person I am today, I really have to thank them for getting me out of my shell that I had when I came out of high school,” Davis said. “They all pushed me to be a better person. It’s a great program with a great group of guys.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51041\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51041\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/","id":5301,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5300,5299,5298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nicole Lantagne Welch Ready To Lead New UCSB Dynasty","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the first time in over 38 years, there will be a new coach of the UCSB women’s volleyball team.

In January, legendary coach Kathy Gregory announced her retirement as UCSB’s head coach. On February 6, it was announced that former Miami women’s volleyball head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch would be stepping in to begin a new era of volleyball in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of great candidates and we had to make a very difficult decision, but [Nicole] has proven that she is a winner and has worked very hard at different schools,” Gregory said. “She was at Texas A&amp;M where she was a recruiter and she won and then went on to Miami, and everywhere she has gone she has proven that she can be successful.”</p>\n<p>Lantagne Welch began her coaching career at her alma mater, the University of Maryland, in 1994 as an assistant coach. She moved onto Ohio State in 1995 and then to Texas A&amp;M in 1997, where as an assistant she reached the NCAA tournament all three years she was there and made the elite eight in 1999.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In 2001 she became the head coach for Miami, where she took over the rebuilding process and restarted the volleyball program after 20 years without a team. In just her second season, Lantagne Welch led her squad to an NCAA Sweet 16 birth.</p>\n<p>In 12 years with the Hurricanes, Lantagne Welch made five NCAA tournaments, one Sweet 16 birth and left with a .669 winning percentage, a record of 243-120. In her last season, she led her team to the NCAA tournament with a 25-6 record and 17 wins in Miami’s Atlantic Coat Conference. Her successful season earned her the ACC Coach of the year and the AVCA East Region Coach of the Year awards.</p>\n<p>“It took a lot of hard work, there were a lot of great coaches that surrounded me over the years and a lot of great players,” Lantagne Welch said. “Recruiting is a huge part of success, getting the right student athlete to succeed in your system. We were known for running a very quick offense and being very athletic and those are some of the things I’m going to try and instill here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>While her talents as a leader and mentor will certainly be sorely missed in Miami, UCSB is happy to welcome her to the Gauchos for her coaching skills both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“I had a really great program at Miami where I was for the last 13 years and 12 seasons, and it was very special to me,” Lantagne Welch said. “There were actually only a couple jobs that I would have ever even considered or looked at and UCSB was one of them.”</p>\n<p>In 2012, five of her players were named as All-East Region players, but equally as impressive and valued here at UCSB is the success of her student athletes in the classroom. During her time with the Hurricanes, she saw a 100 percent graduation rate and in 2012, her players compiled a team GPA of 3.14.</p>\n<p>“She has a very good commitment to academics,” Gregory said. “She fits the mold of commitment to the school with high focus on academics and she is a proven hard worker, so it looks like, on paper, that this will be a great hire.”</p>\n<p>For Lantagne Welch, coming back to So Cal was an easy choice. A native of Encinitas, California, Welch had family ties that piqued her interest in coming to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“This is actually a dream job of mine,” Lantagne Welch said. “My parents were both born and raised in Santa Barbara and my grandfather worked at the university for years, so I have a lot of family connections. I am very familiar with Santa Barbara and UCSB. Plus it’s a great school with a great location and it’s a hotbed state for volleyball. So it’s a no-brainer in terms of a program you can get known nationally and compete at the highest levels.”</p>\n<p>Lantagne Welch takes over a Gauchos team that finished 16-17 last season with a 9-9 Big West Conference record. Though the season did not turn out as a great success, there were many bright spots for the team that should only be better with another year of experience.</p>\n<p>“We just had our full spring season and we are allowed six weeks of full training and we got to compete in four scrimmages,” Lantagne Welch said. “It was a really great time for us to work together. I think if you ask the players and our coaches, you’d hear that we took steps in the right direction. We are improving and we’re working things out.”</p>\n<p>This summer, the team will get together to begin play with a new coach and new system but in a familiar, yet still difficult, Big West Conference. The road will be trying for the Gauchos as they will have a tough schedule ahead of them with Hawaii, who were undefeated in the Big West last season, and the always competitive Long Beach State, who finished in second last season. However, Lantagne Welch remains confident in her team and their abilities moving forward.</p>\n<p>“We talked to the team about it when we started. It’s more of a new era, a new direction and we are taking our own path now wherever that takes us,” Lantagne Welch said. “You worry about what you can control. We have a schedule in front of us and we are going to prepare the best we can.
