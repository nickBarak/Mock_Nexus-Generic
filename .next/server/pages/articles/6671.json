Even as baby-faced high school seniors, their talent was evident; friends, family and classmates alike packed the legendary Sunset Strip hotspot to support the band, who was then playing under the name The Narwhals. Now, the three are filling venues once again — now as Wallows — but this time selling out clubs and theaters to obsessed fans and total strangers. Following their meteoric rise to stardom, the three childhood friends have embarked on their very first North American tour, which kicked off Jan. 24 in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Minnette, Preston and Lemasters backstage at Velvet Jones ahead of their Jan. 30 show in Santa Barbara. The boys, sporting week-old facial hair indicative of the novelty of tour life, spoke with awe over the ability to live out their longtime dream of touring.</p>\n<p>“We have new music coming out soon, so it’s great to have something to promote and play,” Minnette said. Lemasters spoke of how embarking on a tour had never been an <em>if</em>, but rather a <em>when</em>. “Since we were growing up we were always wondering when we would be touring, and you never know when that’s going to happen,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Though Wallows is technically a new band, the three have been playing as a group since they were 13 years old. Different stages of their lives have warranted changes in name (from The Feaver, The Narwhals, finally to Wallows), but only now have they considered making conscious changes to their sound. “Naturally when you’re 15 you’re going to be listening to different things and feeling different things. When you’re 21 and 22 you’re going to be feeling different things. Maybe now and in the years to come it will be more of a conscious evolution,” Lemasters explained. Preston joked, “Yeah, we’re going to change the band name every couple of years.”</p>\n<p>While the band is content in working alone at the moment, they have entertained the idea of dream collaborations, including Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and multi-instrumentalist (Sandy) Alex G. They all agree that they would be thrilled to have “a fire rap verse” from Tyler, The Creator, and definitely wouldn’t say no to a Kanye-produced track. As for influences, Preston cites longtime inspirations Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and more recently The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys and Arcade Fire. Additionally, Minnette believes that Frank Ocean is “the most exciting person in music right now,” which is met with nods of approval from Preston and Lemasters.</p>\n<p>As openers Nucklehead and Precious Kid wrapped up their sets, the crowd grew anxious for Wallows to take the stage. But the band, seemingly immune to the unruly crowd’s impatience, harmonized backstage to Father John Misty’s “Chateau Lobby #4.” Emerging from backstage, the band was greeted with a mob of screaming fans packed like sardines up into the balcony of Velvet Jones. They kicked off their hour-long set with sleepy single “Uncomfortable,” which was met with enthusiasm from the crowd.</p>\n<p>In what turned out to be a surprisingly delightful artistic decision, the group experimented with trumpet and tambourine throughout the performance. In an impressive display, Minnette showed off his uninhibited dance moves, dropping to the floor and dancing with sunflowers gifted by a fan, all while maintaining a hold on his guitar.</p>\n<p>Screams of excitement erupted from the audience when Minnette announced they were to play a brand new song, and it was no disappointment. In one of the highlights of the show, Minnette and Lemasters showed off their impressive vocal ranges, with the latter breaking into a particularly captivating falsetto. Noteworthy drumming by Preston got the entire crowd dancing, even starting a conga line from the backstage area that snaked its way around the venue and up into the balcony.</p>\n<p>Minnette cautioned everyone to be careful following an especially rowdy mosh pit, which impressed fourth-year biochemistry major Sam Phillips. “The female-majority mosh pit was really progressive and really representative of Wallows’ image,” he said.</p>\n<p>Riding on the crowd’s energy, Wallows covered classic Violent Femmes banger “Blister in the Sun,” which spurred crowd-surfing and more moshing.</p>\n<p>The band closed out their set with singles “Pulling Leaves off Trees” and “Pleaser,” switching up the usual lo-fi sound for heavy drums and bass paired with strong vocals.</p>\n<p>Bowing to the demands of the audience, the band returned for an encore, which was far more low-key and personal, ending the set on a high note. Overall, fans were pleased with the performance. Referring to the mixed crowd of fans of the band and fans of the Netflix hit show “13 Reasons Why,” (in which Minnette stars as Clay Jensen), Phillips noted, “It was an interesting intersection between TV pop-culture and music pop-culture.”</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major Jackson Smith was thoroughly impressed by the variety Wallows displayed in their repertoire. “What stood out was the difference between each song, when it would go from a chill, mellow vibe to a faster pace. I enjoyed how the crowd evolved with the music,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the band, along with their friends and families, watched the crowd exit Velvet Jones from atop Ablitt Tower, they reflected on the night, expressing appreciation for the enthusiastic crowd — the majority of which were college students and young adults. However, this should come as no surprise; though they are still on the rise, they have the star power and work ethic that will take them far. Wallows is only going up from here.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

The room quickly began to fill with a combination of dedicated hip hop fans, as well as many people coming off their Deltopia high, creating a kind of sweaty, messy nightclub atmosphere —or at least what someone underage like myself would assume a nightclub is like. Outside of the venue, many students were lined up at the box office outside due to a ticketing error that prevented them from entering. Nevertheless, despite this unfortunate ticketing mistake, the general mood of the crowd felt happy and enthusiastic as they awaited the show that was to come (except for those who couldn’t get in — sorry).</p>\n<p>Special guest Baauer opened the show with an electronic DJ set, similar to what you might see and hear in a rave or at an EDM festival. Made famous from his viral hit, “Harlem Shake,” Baauer has since added to his resume by winning EDM song of year at the Billboard Music Awards, making guest appearances on songs like “Talk Bout Me” by Major Lazer and remixing songs from popular artists in different music genres like No Doubt. Rather than choosing to accept his 15 minutes of fame from the internet success of the “Harlem Shake,” Baauer continues to make music and DJ for people all around the world out of the love for music, which is something to be admired.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Baauer came out on the stage, the rapid and colorful lighting kept his face hidden in silhouette as drunk teens and 20-year-olds in every direction went ballistic. While it was unclear how the DJ himself felt about the crowd due to the strategic lighting, it was apparent that the people in the sea of clout goggles, space buns and Vans were having the time of their lives. Soon enough, however, Baauer left the stage and UCSB students were once again left waiting anxiously for another performer to come take their minds off the feeling of claustrophobia that comes with being an active concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82427\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1804741295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82421\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82427\" data-attachment-id=\"82427\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/vince-staples-ignites-the-warm-up/the-warmup-2018-by-sivash-ghadiri-online-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1236&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1236\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Warmup 2018 by Sivash Ghadiri ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82427\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=888%2C549\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C633&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Fresh off his most recent release, <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, in 2017, Vince Staples has been touring the country performing for fellow rap and hip hop enthusiasts alike. Unlike his debut studio album, <em>Summertime ’06</em>, this second endeavor probes the difficulty of trying to grasp and understand the phenomenon of sudden fame, accompanied with strong electronic and dance influences. As someone who’s grown up in southern California, Staples stays close to his West Coast roots in his quick rapping style and mesmerizing beats which are present in both albums.</p>\n<p>In addition to being a talented rapper, Staples also has a rather philanthropic side as he himself grew up in unfavorable economic circumstances. Concerned with the growing glamorization of dangerous gang lifestyles, Vince Staples is an active member of his community YMCA in North Long Beach where he encourages the youth to try their hand at creative hobbies such as graphic design, music production and filmmaking.</p>\n<p>As the Thunderdome stage went black and a single golden light emerged, the figure of Vince Staples was revealed as he dove straight into his performance and the crowd turned into one jumping entity. However, it wasn’t until he started performing his newest hit “Big Fish” that people really began to let go and engage with the music; the initial ticking of the song was enough to get everyone’s arms thrown in the air, ready to shout the lyrics. This was a sight that could’ve been seen throughout the entire venue, as devoted Vince Staples fans were located in front of the stage, on top of the bleachers, and even dancing in the very back behind all the main commotion.</p>\n<p>The dramatic (and potentially seizure-inducing) lighting dared the audience to treat the show as if it were a true festival. During the performance of popular songs like “Norf Norf” and “Get The Fuck Off My Dick” for example, students were desperately trying to simultaneously keep rhythm with the music and the changing lights, creating a hype that invoked everyone inside the Thunderdome to join in and enjoy the fun.</p>\n<p>Rap may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but either way, there’s no denying that Vince Staples has great talent and a good heart. Though his music career is fairly young, he’s already collaborated with several other musicians who have appeared at UCSB, like Billie Eilish, won impressive awards like Best Impact Track from the BET Hip Hop Awards, and has potential for so much more. In a world of fake musicians with nothing but dollar signs in mind, the Thunderdome was able to host one of the few that fall outside of this category.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_82426\" style=\"width: 870px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"818516468\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82421\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82426\" data-attachment-id=\"82426\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/vince-staples-ignites-the-warm-up/the-warmup-2018-by-sivash-ghadiri-online-17-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?fit=860%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"860,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Warmup 2018 by Sivash Ghadiri ONLINE-17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?resize=860%2C1288\" alt=\"\" width=\"860\" height=\"1288\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?w=860&amp;ssl=1 860w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-17-1.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Feet tapped softly in the aisles to the percussion, and heads rocked steadily to the strong sax solos. Everyone sat at the edges of their seats, leaning forward so as not to miss a single beat. The MCC’s theater flickered with well-timed colored lights to complement the swells of the music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in 1930, just at the tail end of the Jazz Age, Baronian’s unique music has roots in both the traditional Armenian music of his family as well as the revolutionary jazz movement of New York City. Baronian was raised in East Harlem and, in his youth, infamously snuck into performances on New York City’s jazz center 52nd Street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was under furtive entrance to those clubs where he discovered jazz legends such as Lester Young and Billie Holiday. Young and Holiday ultimately served as some of Baronian’s greatest influences on the music he has been composing and performing since 1975. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baronian is the bandleader of Taksim, which features instruments both achingly familiar — the clarinet, the bass, the sax — and keenly exotic —the duduk, the riq, the dombek. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kara Newman, a fourth-year microbiology major, was one of the students in attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love sound, and this is a very distinct sound,” she said. “I love it. They’ve got a really interesting blend.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point during the show, oudist Haig Manoukian pulled out what appeared to be a wooden recorder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I’ve got this instrument here; paid three dollars for it,” he said. “Let’s see what it sounds like.” The band picked up a slow, dramatic prelude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sounds like a funeral march, doesn’t it?” joked Manoukian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He began playing the instrument, immediately enrapturing the crowd. Eventually, the notes grew too high for the whistle, and Manoukian compromised by singing the notes in “doots,” drawing roaring laughter from the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good humor like this took the concert’s atmosphere a step up from that of a mere musical performance, as did the clear camaraderie between the band members. As they played, Taksim’s performers weren’t looking at sheet music. Instead, they made frequent eye contact with one another and with audience members alike, nodding to the beat with appreciative smiles and full confidence in their performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such chemistry among the band members was particularly delightful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m loving the way they feed off each other,” Newman said. “It’s great to watch them and see the conversation in their eyes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concentration of each performer was clearly intense. In a brief break between songs, bassist Sprocket Royer paused to wipe the sweat off his forehead. Drummer Mal Stein frequently closed his eyes as he played, fully immersed in his rhythms. The conclusion of each song was met with enthusiastic applause punctuated with the occasional appreciative whistle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a jazz fan, Newman liked seeing elements of jazz shine through in each song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a lot of great improvisation and a lot of great call and response, which I love to see,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A handful of times throughout the night, Manoukian would pause after a song and look around at his bandmates for prompts on what to perform next. Taksim’s easy-going attitude toward playing music and performing for a crowd made the entire performance truly unique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not always sure what we want to play,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the ringing conclusion of their final song almost two and a half hours after they began, Taksim’s performance prompted a well-deserved standing ovation. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

their performance on Monday night put on by KCSB at The Hard to Find Showspace. The lineup for the mini festival that was held inside a Christian church included Espresso, The Crudes, Pookie, Easter Teeth and Arrington de Dionyso. Espresso and The Crudes turned the crowd into a sea of moshing Old Skool Vans.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native band, Pookie, coasted through their performance by playing most of the intricate and carefree instrumentals from their latest project “Fifteen Seconds of No Thank You.” Pookie performed the picturesque soundtrack to mask despair through cheerful melodies that sound like sitting by a beach at dusk. Despite the lack of crowd attendance, the engaging post-punk band, Easter Teeth, sang their track “Truckstop Fear,” which led to a couple head bangs from the crowd as band members Josh and Tim drawled out the lovestruck lyrics, “I wish I could miss you.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For having released their album <em>Graveled Guts</em> just last month, The Crudes looked like rock stars head banging along to the sounds reverberating from the bass. The band has musical qualities similar to those of popular indie acts Yellow Days and Cuco, which quickly caught the attention of the crowd. The slow pace of the guitar on soulful anthem “Kaby,” led x-scribbled hands to sway in the air. The raspy “Bojangles” created a groove that placed the band’s melodies on a pedestal. The Crudes showcased a performance of the sludgy track “Piglet,” where the electric guitar meandered and could have made its way on a “That 70s Show” scene.</p>\n<p>Most DIY bands that have carved a name for themselves in Los Angeles have utilized spaces such as The Smell and local backyard parties.

The guitars swelled as the romantic ballad “Piglet’s Journey,” crooned throughout the venue, leading couples in matching Dickies to dance around as if they were the stars of an indie coming-of-age film.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80605\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"283739196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80603\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80605\" data-attachment-id=\"80605\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/arrington-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"arrington-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80605\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arrington-6.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of KCSB</p></div>\n<p>Espresso ended their set with “Space Ship, Space Dick” off their 2016 album <em>Bobe</em>, meanwhile affirming the startling beauty in mosh pits. Lead-singer and guitarist, Dashel Dupuy, admired the girls who were bravely entering the mosh pit.</p>\n<p>“To all the girls who aren’t afraid to go in the mosh pit, you’re sick and I appreciate you,” he said.</p>\n<p>The crowd started to dance as if they were in a ’70s disco party, despite the fast-paced drumming and bass melting off the walls of the venue that simultaneously acts as a church of the venue.</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major Melissa Saavedra commented on Espresso’s ability to bring people who don’t know each other together.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy how a band can bring a group of people who don’t ordinarily hang out with each other to all comfortably jam out together,” she said.</p>\n<p>On the heels of Espresso’s lively set, Washington-based Arrington de Dionyso astonished the audience with his ability to emphasize the minimal instrumentation flowing from the drums and the saxophone. By gauging the facial appearances of the crowd, I saw that they were initially put off ease by two guys who weren’t singing over King Krule melodies.</p>\n<p>Third-year English major, Chloe Anderson, compared Dionyso’s instrumentals to a Spongebob reference.</p>\n<p>“If I could best sum up Arrington de Dionyso’s intense performance, I’d title it like Squidward’s art piece, ‘the bold and the brash.’ He was able to make sounds that aren’t conventionally beautiful and rather bold sound like something new and beautiful,” she said.</p>\n<p>Arrington de Dionyso put the audience in a trance by pushing the envelope, as he used a water pipe to emulate the cries of his saxophone.</p>\n<p>Dionyso’s instrumental catharsis received a standing ovation that finalized a night of groovy songs, surf beats, sax meltdowns and unexpected dynamic performances. Dionyso ended the night by pointing out the sign that accompanied his performance place that simply stated, “This Saxophone Kills Fascists.”</p>\n<p>He concluded, “In this time, it’s important to build up the community, and we can start by just sharing music. Music is a language in itself, it’s what brought us all together.”</p>\n<p>KCSB constantly puts on events that house the alternative DIY bands for listeners who need to let out some angst in the mosh pit, find a sense a community, and melt away to some groovy tracks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-24/kcsb-showcases-local-diy-bands-in-weekday-jam-session/","id":6670,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6669,6668,6667],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
