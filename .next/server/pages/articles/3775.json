The prosecutor alleges that Chen was one of these three men and has charged him with two separate counts of rape.</p>\n<p>One key claim in the prosecutors’ case is that Chen used two separate condoms, which the prosecutors say allows them to charge Chen with two separate rapes. The complaint says Chen “had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his actions and nevertheless resumed his sexually assaultive behavior and raped Jane Doe a second time.”</p>\n<p>Chen is due back in court on April 6.</p>\n<p><em>University News Editor Supriya Yelimeli contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Both cases hit the victim in the leg, and she whom suffered swelling and bruising on her inner right knee. Rodriguez became highly agitated once the authorities arrived. The victim later signed a citizen’s arrest and Rodriguez was taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, deputies responded to a call for a possible verbal altercation between domestic partners on the 6600 block of Trigo. Subsequent investigation found there was no argument taking place. However, the 19-year-old male resident, Jose Benitez of Santa Barbara, had three outstanding misdemeanor warrants and was arrested.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, an I.V. Foot Patrol bicycle unit was deployed throughout I.V. and issued eight citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations, and two physical arrests, one for lewd behavior and the other for prowling at a local church.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, IVFP recorded seven physical arrests and 15 citations, mostly for alcohol and noise violations. Also, all IVFP units responded to Storke Road in front of Rusty’s Pizza for a traffic collision with a severe injury and a subject pinned under a vehicle. A juvenile pedestrian was struck as she waited with her family at the bus stop. The driver of the vehicle had lost control immediately after a traffic collision with another driver and then veered onto the curb and bus stop area.</p>\n<p>On Saturday three deputies made six physical arrests and 12 citations.</p>\n<p>At approximately midnight, deputies responded to a call about a suspect prowling in the backyard of a property on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde. The suspect was described as a black male adult, wearing a red baseball cap, grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and carrying a red duffel bag and laptop. Deputies detained the suspect in the alleyway behind the residence on suspicion of prowling. A line-up was conducted and the subjects who had seen him prowling identified him, though they decided they did not want to pursue charges. The identified suspect was not in possession of a duffel bag, and when K9 units arrived on scene, they were unable to locate the duffel bag. The suspect is a person of interest in several possessions of stolen property cases. Because no stolen property was found, the suspect was released and a report was filed for documentation purposes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

an attempt to force the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on bills that would protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.</p>\n<p>“Obviously this is a long overdue vote that’s needed, and it’s forcing the leadership to have to bring this legislation forward,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">Carbajal said the goal of the discharge petition is to have a bipartisan bill that provides DACA recipients with the same benefits that they have received under the DACA program.</span></p>\n<p>The petition was first proposed by Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo in mid-May.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 205 members of Congress have signed the petition, according to the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0010.xml\">Clerk of the House of Representatives</a>. Overall, 218 congressmen and congresswomen must sign the petition for it to be considered.</p>\n<p>If enough members of Congress sign the petition, the document will force a vote in the House on several bills, according to Carbajal.</p>\n<p>The bill which receives the most votes in House of Representatives will be adopted under a “queen-of-the-hill” procedure, which is a special method members of Congress can use to allow a series of bills to be voted on, according to <a href=\"https://valadao.house.gov/uploadedfiles/congressional_research_service_queen_of_the_hill_rules.pdf\">the Congressional Research Service</a>.</p>\n<p>The bill that then receives the most votes will pass the House.</p>\n<p>House members can propose discharge petitions when a bill has been introduced and referred to a committee for 30 or more legislative days, according to the House of Representatives rules.</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes legislation to protect DACA recipients would pass “overwhelmingly” if it was voted on in the House, according to a press release sent out by Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p>“There are many good bipartisan proposals to ensure that the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients who have grown up in this country, gone to school, and paid their taxes are allowed to continue living and working in the only home they’ve known,” Carbajal said in the press release.</p>\n<p>Should the discharge petition gain the required number of signatures, the four bills likely under consideration are the Securing America’s Future Act of 2018, the D.R.E.A.M. Act of 2017, the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act of 2018 and a bill that House Speaker Paul Ryan will propose, according to Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p>It is currently unclear what Ryan will propose, according to Carbajal’s office.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4760\">The Securing America’s Future Act of 2018</a>, introduced by Congressman Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, would provide current DACA recipients a renewable legal status but would also decrease national immigration levels and authorize construction of a border wall, according to <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011018-Securing-Americas-Future-Act-Final.pdf\">the House Judiciary Committee</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3440\">The D.R.E.A.M. Act of 2017</a> would provide lawful permanent residence status to DACA recipients and others meeting certain conditions and provide a path to citizenship for eligible individuals, according to a press release from Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, one of its sponsors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4796\">The USA Act of 2018</a> would also provide lawful permanent residence status to DACA recipients and other eligible persons. It has additional provisions as well, including increasing the number of immigration judges, according to a press release from Congressman William Hurd’s office.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he is “very hopeful” that the discharge petition will gather enough signatures.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 24, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.
