During his lecture, Kristof spoke about his time reporting in various conflict-ridden areas around the globe as well as about what he calls the “empathy gap,” a phenomenon in current news reporting which fails to follow up on the need for action in areas facing humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p>According to Appelbaum, Kristof’s work has led him to extraordinary situations while traveling. For instance, the Chinese government denied Kristof a visa due to his New York Times reporting on ethnic cleansing in Sudan, for which Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu calls Kristof an “honorary African,” Appelbaum said.</p>\n<p>“Nick is a deeply engaged journalist, a relentless educator,” Appelbaum said. “Santa Barbara is the most benign place he is likely to visit. Nick subscribes to the Indiana Jones school of journalism.”</p>\n<p>Kristof’s newly published book, co-written with his wife Sheryl WuDunn, A Path Appears, addresses one of the constraints of global philanthropic efforts, which Kristof describes as “an empathy gap.”</p>\n<p>“The starting point is to chip away at this distance, build a broader scope of empathy and agreement,” Kristof said. “When you encounter need, you respond. Poverty is not just an economic failing, it is a moral failing on the part of people who can help.”</p>\n<p>Kristof said while “there is a deep human yearning for silver bullets,” in reality it takes a consistent effort of small actions to “collectively have an impact” on global crises.</p>\n<p>“It’s because of this kind of change that I believe extreme poverty is going to be eliminated on our watch,” Kristof said. “I’m a great believer in education, in my opinion it’s the best escalator out of poverty. But when we have tools and knowledge that would transform the lives of children and we don’t implement them, there is a real irresponsibility on the part of society as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, the tendency of journalists to “avoid … hopefulness” has created a flaw within news reporting.</p>\n<p>“We leave the impression that Africa is crashing when in fact there are amazing things going on,” Krisof said. “The problem is that the worst in the world is often next to the best. We need to convey triumphs as well as disasters of human conviction.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said people and governments fail to use all the tools available to address crises, such as the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.</p>\n<p>“We should have learned from AIDS,” Kristof said. “You have to intervene early, but there was no rush with Ebola partially due to indifference. We could have stopped [Ebola] at a huge saving of money and lives.”</p>\n<p>Kristof also said he is concerned with the public disinterest in current news, discussing an ABC TV special on global health and the subsequent cancellation of the special.</p>\n<p>“The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation had bribed ABC to cover global health issues, and by bribe I mean a grant,” Kristof said. “After one series, ABC News said that they didn’t want the money from the foundation anymore because viewers switched the channel when these programs came on. Is there no business model to cover really important stories?”</p>\n<p>Kristof said he predicts the reporting and covering of important stories will decline further in the coming decade.</p>\n<p>“If you think we’ve dropped the ball in the last 10 years, it will get worse in the next ten years,” Kristof said.</p>\n<p>According to Kristof, George Clooney was a “terrific travel partner” during their time traveling to Darfur, Sudan, in 2009, where Clooney hoped to draw media attention to the genocide in Darfur.</p>\n<p>“We shared a room in Darfur that has a huge bloodstain on the wall, it was never explained,” Kristof said. “When we involved celebrities in our novel we were worried it would cheapen issues, but at the end of the day it is difficult to get people’s attentions to these issues.”</p>\n<p>Political science graduate student Shannon Schumacher, who participated in the Q&amp;A portion of the lecture, said that while she was a “little bit disappointed” by the lack of structure in Kristof’s argument, she expressed appreciation that Kristof offered solutions to the problems he presented.</p>\n<p>“Some key points I really did enjoy were his comments on his idea of the empathy gap and trying to generate how can people see things from other sides and how can we as individuals really feel empowered to help,” Schumacher said. “I like that he offered suggestions of how to do that but I was looking for a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Recent alumnus and former biology major Andrew Floren was able to speak with Kristof before the lecture, which he said offered him a “unique perspective” on topics discussed during the lecture.</p>\n<p>“I asked him how he keeps his idealism and he kind of touched upon it,” Floren said. “‘It’s being out in the field and doing a lot of work,’ [he said] and I just looked him in the eye and I understood because I’ve been out in the field as well internationally and it’s something where once you see that, you can’t look away you can’t ignore it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies and communication major Katie Koerper said while the lecture did not give her a clear idea of what she will pursue after graduation, Kristof’s lecture “reignites the fire of really wanting to help people.”</p>\n<p>“I think this is very inspiring for me because I hear, as well as study, a lot about these topics,” Koerper said.<br>\nWhile concluding his lecture, Kristof said each individual has their own “spotlight” they can use to move change in the world.</p>\n<p>“Whether it be your Twitter, Facebook, book clubs or bulletin boards,” Kristof said. “Use these lights to shed information on the important issues. As we drop the ball, I hope you guys can pick it back up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-16/award-winning-journalist-speaks-at-campbell-hall/","id":2975,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2974,2973,2972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"BSU Holds Weeklong Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NexuslogoBLUE1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NexuslogoBLUE1.jpg?resize=384%2C288&ssl=1","description":"Black Student Union (BSU) hosted “A Week of Education and Action” which began Monday and ends tomorrow to address issues regarding racism and police brutality on a local and national level.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Black Student Union (BSU) hosted “A Week of Education and Action” which began Monday and ends tomorrow to address issues regarding racism and police brutality on a local and national level.</p>\n<p>During the week of action there were lectures on law enforcement rights and the importance of education, there was a workshop on the formation of a task force to address police brutality and there was a screening of the drama film “Fruitvale Station” with a follow-up discussion. The week will conclude with the Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UC Irvine, an annual gathering black students from across the state aiming to build leadership skills among students over the weekend.</p>\n<p>According to BSU outreach chair and third-year sociology and black studies major Jamelia Harris, the week not only aims to educate students about prevalent issues related to police brutality and racism, but is also meant to encourage students to take action through strategy building and development.</p>\n<p>“Our main goals are to raise community consciousness, develop strategies to enforce police accountability, develop a task force on police brutality, and create productive spaces where we can continue this dialogue and share ideas and visions with one another,” Harris said in an email. “It’s about inspiring developing leaders to emerge.”</p>\n<p>The week began on Monday with English professor Felice Blake facilitating a workshop on individual rights and was followed by a lecture on Tuesday by black studies and sociology professor George Lipsitz, who spoke about “education as a tool for dismantling systems of oppression.”</p>\n<p>According to Lipsitz, BSU’s week of education and action is an illustration of students’ desire to instigate change in the local and national political climate.</p>\n<p>“It shows that intelligent young people don’t want to be passive spectators to what is happening in this world,” Lipsitz said. “It is extremely encouraging for me to see these students engaging in self-education and activism that is designed to know about the world but also to change it.”</p>\n<p>Lipsitz also said BSU’s grassroots mobilization is a vital part of prompting societal change, especially in light of recent events regarding police brutality that have put issues of race in the national spotlight.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time looking for leaders,” Lipsitz said. “But we can solve our own problems. Nobody is going to do for us what we fail to do for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, the involvement of Blake and Lipsitz in the week of events is crucial for the continuation of the Black Lives Matter movement, a black rights movement ongoing since the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and amplified by the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner last year.</p>\n<p>“Dr. George Lipsitz has been called to serve and guest speak in Ferguson following the non-indictments, and Dr. Felice Blake holds a significant position in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and has devoted much of her work to servicing marginalized communities,” Harris said in an email. “We’re blessed to have faculty members who have demonstrated their commitment to progression within the Black community through several avenues.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, police brutality against citizens occurs both nationally and locally, including in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“SB is not innocent or estranged from the poisons of police brutality,” Harris said in an email. “In 2013, the amount of deaths caused by SBPD was double that of deaths caused by civilian murders.”</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara Police Department Sgt. Riley Harwood said the statistic is not valid and cannot be linked to police brutality.</p>\n<p>“In 2013 we had two officer-involved shootings, one of which the suspect was killed,” Harwood said. “In 2013 we had more people killed in vehicular homicides than officer-involved shootings, so I don’t really know where that [statistic] is coming from.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and BSU member Harper Howell, the topics discussed during the week allow students like her to question the role of law enforcement in American culture.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the fact that all police are bad people, it’s just we need to question the way that they are being taught,” Howell said. “So that’s something as a nation we need to start getting involved in, and I’m glad we’re doing it here.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, January 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Project SERV is a financial award typically granted in as emergency funding to assist educational institutions facing a crisis. The grant enables existing campus-based mental health services provided by Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) to expand by temporarily hiring additional staff members.</p>\n<p>Director of C.A.P.S. Jeanne Stanford said it is “both sad and impressive” that the D.O.E. has an office to respond to violence in schools.</p>\n<p>“Many schools, colleges and universities have benefited from these funds to increase mental health services after episodes of violence,” Stanford said in an email. “This award is critical to our ability to continue to serve the increased needs of our community in the aftermath of the tragic violence in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Student Affairs will propose to use the grant money to lease office and reception space on the second floor of the I.V. Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said. Fleming also said the grant will allow for expansion of campus staff to provide mental health and wellness services as well as more campus advocacy and prevention services to students.</p>\n<p>“The shared suite would house four counseling psychologists from CAPS, a sexual violence advocate and a sexual violence educator from C.A.R.E. and an additional student mental health coordinator, along with a receptionist/administrative assistant,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fleming said the facility could be used to host a variety of services in addition to mental health, including campus community-building events and activities.</p>\n<p>“Both C.A.P.S. and C.A.R.E. would anticipate scheduling group activities and meetings, as well as some programs open to the broader community in the meeting rooms and in the nearby church building once it is renovated as a community center,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Wellness Services Angela Andrade said she is “thrilled about the grant” and that the funds will be used to support new counseling psychologists, a social worker, a counselor for faculty and staff and an additional staff member in Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>“SMHCS provides outreach and support for students in distress and those concerned about a student in distress,” Andrade said. “The grant will allow us to assist more students and community members and extend our services into Isla Vista where many of our students live.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. requested two additional psychologists specifically to increase availability of counseling appointments and same-day crisis intakes for students dealing with acute stress.</p>\n<p>She also said C.A.P.S. requested resources for outreach to students, staff, faculty, teaching assistants and student groups in order to allow students to be “re-stimulated by returning to Isla Vista and campus, especially in anticipation of the year commemoration of the May 2014 tragedy.”</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S. will] increase the number of grief and trauma groups offered for those affected,” Stanford said in an email, “and increase number of places/locations on and off campus where psychologists are available.”</p>\n<p>The increased mental health support services on campus will help reduce and possibly prevent the longer term psychological effects tragic instances like the May 23 shootings have had on campus, Stanford said.</p>\n<p>“Together we will continue to grow stronger,” Stanford said in an email. “The funds will enable us to continue to spread the message of care for our fellow Gauchos, continue our Pathway to Healing, and encourage our community to speak up for each other as we all can benefit from an encouraging word or voice of concern.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
