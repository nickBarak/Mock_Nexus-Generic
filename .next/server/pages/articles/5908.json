I can honestly say that my time at UCSB was the happiest four years of my life. About a month after graduation, I moved to Belize with a two-year job commitment with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.</p>\n<p>But the reason I’m writing this isn’t to make you jealous or to show off. I am writing an appeal to anyone who will listen. As it stands this tropical little “paradise” that is know about by few Americans (and of those mostly in terms of tourism) is bleeding out. Drug smuggling, gang violence and poverty are literally killing this nation. According to a U.N. report published in April 2012, Belize is the fifth most dangerous country in the world. A few months ago, three people were killed on the street in broad daylight. The government has responded by declaring that in certain areas, houses can be broken into and people can be arrested without a warrant. We have had enough experience with the Gang Suppression Unit to know this is a bogus solution. To make the point clear, the Police Commissioner’s wife was roughed up by police officers after she tried to stop them from beating up a man on the street.</p>\n<p>Why am I telling you all of this? Because one of the main causes of all of this pain is drug trafficking en route to the States. The coke that gets used during a weekend in I.V. is tied to the boy that is killed on the street here in Belize. I know this because I know kids who were in primary school when they were used as drug mules. It’s impossible to deny the damage that is linked to America’s drug habits. The death toll from the war on drugs and the cartels in Mexico is in the tens of thousands. I don’t want to sound sanctimonious or holier than thou, but if you decide to indulge in things that weren’t locally grown (if you catch my drift), even if it’s “just once to try it” or “only a few times when I’m really drunk” it adds fuel to this fire.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I am writing this because I believe that the average UCSB student doesn’t want to cause harm to others. On the contrary, I believe the average UCSB student is passionate about making the world a safer and more loving place, but sometimes we’re so trapped in our little surreal privilege bubble of university life that we forget that our actions do have consequences. My plea for you (and for everyone else) is to then help create a culture of resistance to cocaine or any other foreign drug use.</p>\n<p>There are some very smart people at UCSB who I have talked to about this who feel like legalization would be a great fix to this problem. While it may be someday, the reality now is that there is no such thing as “fair trade” cocaine. Also, I just don’t have enough blind faith in the “invisible hand” of the international free market to turn this industry bloodless. Why? Because while clothing, cell phones and Apple products are all legal, that hasn’t stopped the capitalistic pursuit of profit from creating inhumane conditions to make these products for consumers. One just has to look at Foxconn in China or Savar, Bangladesh to see the lengths people will go to make money. And drug cartels are nothing if not bloody efficient capitalists.</p>\n<p>Let people know it’s not cool, and that other human beings died in the process of getting that drug to California. Please don’t turn a blind eye to the sufferings of those who are victims of our people’s wealth and indulgences. There are plenty of strong and inspiring women and men in Belize who are trying to take back their country from the violence that plagues it. They don’t need our “help” as much as they need us to stop “harming.” I know there’s still enough hope and idealism at UCSB to make a difference.</p>\n<p><em>Janet Ornelas graduated in 2011 with a B.A. in Chican@ studies and Spanish.</em></p>\n<h6> This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, May 31, 2013</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Dozens of news and media outlets have chosen to boycott the mascot and refer to the team as I just have — “the professional football team in D.C.” It’s because the name of the actual mascot is an outright slur that wouldn’t even be in the vocabulary of a decent person, were it not for its singular appearance in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Team owner Daniel Snyder is indifferent about the campaign, going as far as telling reporters to print the word “never” in capital letters when writing about the prospects of a name change. It’s a damning situation, but a surprisingly common one.</p>\n<p>However, some teams such as the Florida State Seminoles have gained acceptance from local First Nations people because of their particularly respectful representations.

The gaucho is an equivalent of the North American cowboy. The depiction we use is a cartoon and it’s comical, but definitely not in a good-natured way. In fact, it’s quite dehumanizing. The fact that we use cultural terms like this for a cheap gimmick to make money is as off-putting and disgusting to me as it is to see a bro decked out in stereotypical drunk Mexican threads on Halloween night in I.V.</p>\n<p>So I propose that either this institution set up a cultural exchange initiative with the people of the region most commonly associated with the gaucho, which would be quite educational and potentially eye-opening for most students, or that we change the name outright.</p>\n<p>I, for one, fully support the latter measure. We have even had a history of flirting with a name change, with the Cubs being the front-runner during our transition to the UC system way back when. I would love to be a Cub; it’s catchy, cute and cuddly, with a potential mean streak. It also beats getting the usual “WTF” reaction we get when telling people what our current mascot is.</p>\n<p>If this past weekend found you asking why Columbus Day is a legitimate thing after all the terrible things he did, it’s because the people in power really just don’t care. There’s too much at stake. But why not be thinkers? Why not be empathetic?

This year’s premiere opened with Paramount Pictures’ adaption of the classic French children’s novel, <em>The Little Prince</em>. Published in 1943 by author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the children’s book is adapted to several languages and it is widely recognized by millions of fans around the world.</p>\n<p>The story of <em>The Little Prince</em> follows the adventure of the little boy from a distant planet who meets an elder aviator in the Sahara dessert. Together, the two companions seek out different planets before their final destination on their journey to Earth. However, the animated film directed by Mark Osborne is not a direct adaption of the book. Inspired by the story of the little prince’s world, the 2015 film creates its own plotline by introducing a set of new characters.</p>\n<p>Before stepping into famous the role of the aviator, Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges had some hesitations about portraying the beloved character.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I was concerned because it’s a wonderful book and I thought it wouldn’t be a good idea to just simply animate those classic illustrations,” the 66 year-old actor said. “That it didn’t ring right to me, and he [the director] said ‘no it’s not like that.’”</p>\n<p>The director was able to win over the Academy Award winner using a very convincing object: “I notice he’s holding a suitcase, so I asked ‘what’s that suitcase’ then he said ‘well, I have something to show you,’” Bridges said. “He opens the suitcase and it sort of looked the suitcase little prince would have carried with him on his journey and all kind of magical things that let me know that his imagination was in the right spot,” Bridges said.</p>\n<p>The film begins with the story of a young girl (voiced by Edward and Bella’s daughter in “Twilight,” Mackenzie Foy) and her mother (Rachel McAdams) as they prepare for the admission process of a strict education. The mother puts her daughter on a disciplined academic schedule for her to excel in school, but the agenda is interrupted when the little girl meets her next-door neighbor, a retired aviator. From then on, the aviator introduces the little girl to his story of a young prince whom he had journeyed with on different planets.</p>\n<p>When asked about her favorite part of the book, Mackenzie Foy spoke of the scene where a hat was in fact an elephant inside a snake.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I read it, I went around showing all my friends, asking ‘what do you see, what do you see? Is it a hat or a snake around an elephant?’” 15-year-old Foy said. “Before I did a session, I’d read the book, just to get a feel of it, that way, it’s easier to bring a feel to the movie if you know the book.”</p>\n<p>Amidst their journey, the aviator and the prince encounter characters on different planets, including a Rose (Marion Cotillard) who becomes the affection of the Little Prince, a Snake (Benicio Del Toro) who is sly and cunning and a Fox (James Franco) who yearns to be tamed. In order for the prince to return to his planet, he must sacrifice himself by being bitten by the snake. Deeply enthralled and upset by the ending of the adventure, the Little Girl sets out to rewrite the story; she decides to find the prince (where he is now an adult working tirelessly away), returns him to his planet and helps him become the young boy he was once again. She eventually finishes the story for the aviator, and together with her mother, the two develop a greater, loving relationship with the help of the story of the Little Prince.</p>\n<p>For director Mark Osborne, the film was a family affair (his son Riley voiced The Little Prince).</p>\n<p>“I first read it when I was about 20 — my wife gave me her copy of the book,” Osborne said. “We weren’t married at that point, but we were just dating and now we’re married with two kids … the book really became a part of our life together, a part of our relationship.”</p>\n<p>As for Riley Osborne, being the voice of the Little Prince was nothing more than a day at work with dad.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of like hanging out with my dad.

I believe the audience in the Pollock did as well, as they were not only laughing uproariously at the string of witticisms that flowed freely from his mouth, but also at the rest of the characters, realized by the collaborative efforts of John McNamara and Jay Roach.</p>\n<p>The eponymous film relegates the most turbulent period in the screenwriter’s life — during which he and his fellow members of the Hollywood Ten were blacklisted from working in Hollywood thanks to the U.S. government finding them in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify.</p>\n<p>The film is about an ideological battle for justice, as well as a study of Trumbo as a person. The acclaimed writer is a Communist who loves money and a family man more invested in his work than family. He’s an intellectual blind to the fact that his crusade is hurting those he cares about, yet he continues to undermine the forces that put him and his fellow writers out of mainstream Hollywood by writing for a B-movie studio (run by John Goodman in his usual fine, somewhat disgruntled form) and working with fellow blacklisted writers, one of whom is played by the suitably acerbic Louis C.K. But I digress. Will “Trumbo” earn Bryan Cranston his first Oscar? Who knows, but if he doesn’t at least get nominated, I’ll (insert half-assed Cold War joke disguised as a threat here) the Academy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Out of the film’s expansive ensemble cast, some other notable and as of yet unmentioned names include Elle Fanning as Trumbo’s strong-willed daughter Nikola (a role she absolutely excels in), Alan Tudyk as indignant writer Ian McLellan Hunter (and former professor of McNamara’s) and Christian Berkel in a hilariously scene-stealing performance as the dry-humored director of “Exodus,” Otto Preminger. However, I do have to admit confusion as to why Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje got such a high billing in the credits; while he was quite good in his role, he was onscreen for less than ten minutes.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a film such as this one, however, credit absolutely must be given to the screenwriter. McNamara managed to generate smart humor and really rile up the emotions in his script. Often, the humor comes from the dialogue as opposed to the situations the characters find themselves in (with the exception of one gleefully violent scene featuring John Goodman taking a baseball bat to a politician in the epitome of a liberal apologist’s wet dream), showcasing the biting wit of Hollywood’s best.  Through both the celebrity figures’ and the common man’s treatment of Trumbo and company, we are reminded of how overwhelmingly, cruelly paranoid (and, in John Wayne’s case, even somewhat hypocritical) communist-era America was. In light of … ahem, recent events, one cannot help feeling a sense of déjà vu; as Roach said during the Q&amp;A portion of the Pollock screening, “Who would spend millions of dollars on a committee to ask hours of questions and get nothing?” Ouch.</p>\n<p>Once the film was over and the applause had died down, the gangly Roach and the squinting McNamara strode onstage to be greeted by the smiling Pollock director, Matthew Ryan. When asked about how he had come to write the film, McNamara described how he had first encountered Bruce Cook’s biography Dalton Trumbo in his 20s, only to adapt it 30 years later. A friend who had read the book convinced him when he they said, “It’s the rarest thing: a true story with a happy ending.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, former “Austin Powers” director Jay Roach (a franchise which he said he’d be willing to work on again) sung the praises of many, including McNamara for his script and the Hollywood Ten for their sarcastic wit. He told amusing stories about the cast as well, such as recounting Helen Mirren’s love for her character’s hats and Elle Fanning’s unnerving ability to refrain from blinking. Roach also highlighted the conservative views America held at the time, highlighting his father’s own opinions and the film industry’s efforts to make Hollywood seem more “American.”</p>\n<p>“Trumbo’s” ultimate prevailing theme (one which the trailer shoves in your face) is that nobody has the right to tell you what to do and how to think. If someone like Dalton Trumbo comes face to face with overwhelming odds and stand up against them, they’ll come out all the stronger in the end. And no matter how bad the fight gets, nobody is ever truly alone.  If I may paraphrase the line that got the loudest applause, “For better or worse…we are Spartacus.”</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to say that the experience was worth sitting in the front row, as well as the ensuing cramping in the back of his neck.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/","id":5907,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5906,5905,5904],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
