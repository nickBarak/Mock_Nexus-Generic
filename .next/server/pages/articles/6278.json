However, Careless Cub just released their first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, thus solidifying their mark on the I.V. music scene in a succinct eight-song declaration of the trio’s talents. The three-piece includes Grant Chesin, a fourth-year English major on lead vocals and guitar, Andrew Becker, a fourth-year chemical engineering major on drums and backup vocals and, finally, Ray Muhlenkamp, a third-year computer science and German double major on bass (who also used to play in The Mallards!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-described as “singer-songwriter surf rock,” Careless Cub and their new album have the distinct Isla Vista sound of melodic tunes mixed in with faster, upbeat rhythms and lyrics expressing contemplation of life, young love and growing up. To create this sound, the band describes having strong musical influences from Father John Misty, The Growlers, Courtney Barnett and The Eagles. However, the band acknowledges their changing sound as they try to figure out which genre they belong to through different styles of music. “I think it’s hard to say we’re a certain genre. It’s not like an egotistical thing; it’s more just like, here we’ll play a punk song, there an alt-rock song, a vibey surf rock song,” Chesin says, “We’re just finding our way through the music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stands out not merely for its musical elements but also for the production and sound quality of the tracks. In an interview with the band, I inquired about the recording process and, to my surprise, another I.V. musician was the one to thank for the polished debut. “Alec Luttrell from Odd Army was the guy who mixed, tracked and mastered everything, and the reason it sounds so high-quality is completely because of him. He did an amazing job,” Muhlenkamp said. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most of the tracks have a mellow, house party vibe, “Hemingway Lemonade,” “Skipping Town” and “As a Kid” are the ones to look out for. In my brief talk with Careless Cub, they explained how “Hemingway Lemonade” has definitely been a fan favorite since the album’s release on Feb. 1 — and it’s clear as to why. Classic alt-rock guitar strumming starts the song, calling for listeners far and wide to join Careless Cub on their journey through college in the fun and daring environment that is Isla Vista. For the most part, “Hemingway Lemonade” is a relaxed, chill song that anyone with an ounce of rhythm in their bodies can sway and bob their heads to. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86090\" style=\"width: 1009px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2026532933\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86089\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86090\" data-attachment-id=\"86090\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/a-word-with-careless-club-on-flophouse-palace/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=999%2C1005&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,1005\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=888%2C893&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86090\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=888%2C893\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=768%2C773&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Careless Cub</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Skipping Town” has a personal tone, as the first lyrics literally begin with advice from singer Chesin’s supposed therapist. This song then describes the kind of romantic insecurity that naturally comes with being in love at this young age and lays out a plan for the protagonist to skip town and start over in an emotional, alt-rock college ballad. “I’ll come up with a melody and lyrics and then I’ll play it to them [Becker and Muhlenkamp] and they’ll go ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ and then they start building their parts,” Chesin described the songwriting process. “I’d say especially ‘Family Tree’ and ‘Yikes a Daisies’ have almost become entirely their songs with how much they added.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chesin cited “Monterey Bay” and “I Can’t Believe You Fell in Love with Me” as his favorite songs, while Becker and Muhlenkamp both agreed on “Never Coming Home,” which they cheekily described as the one “that has the least amount of listens right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to asking about where the songwriting came from and what their favorite songs were, I had to know — what does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually mean? Well, according to front man Chesin: “The name ‘Flophouse Palace’ is from the book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannery Row</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I thought it’s such a funny oxymoron.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Flophouse’ is defined as essentially people who stay there for a couple days and trash it, and that’s kind of Isla Vista,” he explained. “It’s like sometimes you feel ‘Oh my god, I’m in a dream land,’ to ‘This is the worst place.’ Also, I live at this place called the Palace, which isn’t a real palace, but it’s just kind of a play on that.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want more of Careless Cub?

After the merge, everything centered on big threats versus little threats and lions versus hyenas, as said by Vlachos. In a season of winners, everyone was a threat to grab the crown, but some were such dominating winners that they knew they were threats. People like Vlachos, Ben Driebergen, Jeremy Collins and Tyson Apostol needed each other to protect themselves from hyenas and people like Clarke, Nick Wilson and Spradlin-Wolfe who were sneaky, strategic and under the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gameplay this season was intense and extremely fast paced. One fantastic move was Denise Stapley single-handedly voting out Diaz-Twine (thus dubbing her the “Queen slayer”) using a hidden immunity idol that Diaz-Twine had given to her. This took guts and moved Stapley up from the “lower-threat” position she was in before. At the merge feast, she described the move, maybe leaking too much information. Clarke picked up on this, saying that “it just made her look really good. But I have to imagine everybody at the table thought, ‘Hmm, like, one person has a resume out here, good to know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final nine, Vlachos brilliantly blindsided Clarke in a 4-3-2 vote, an extremely rare shake-up. Unsure if Collins had an idol to save himself, the majority alliance of Clarke, Sarah Lacina, Driebergen, Wilson and Vlachos decided to split the vote between Collins and Fitzgerald. Spradlin-Wolfe and Stapley saw this as a good opportunity to get rid of a threat and joined them. Spradlin-Wolfe, one of the most intuitive people to play the game, said, “I think Tony is trying to play double agent … I feel like Tony is my biggest enemy out here right now.” She was proven correct when Vlachos flipped, bringing Wilson, Fitzgerald and Collins together to vote for Clarke, who went home with an idol in her pocket. It was an unfortunate ending but a major win for Tony.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recency bias be damned, I like Wilson, even though he did the opposite of what I wanted many times, like voting out Clarke, Kwon and Spradlin-Wolfe. He also voted out Shallow, his high school crush (and my personal all-time favorite player), when he could’ve easily swung the vote to Wendell Holland and shaken things up. That takes a lot of nerve to do, and if I were on the island with Shallow, I don’t think I would ever write her name down, as it goes against my beliefs as a Shallow fan (the main one being that she should have won “Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains”). I wouldn’t win the game, but at least we’d be friends, and that’s what really matters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With good moves come bad moves, and Driebergen’s decision to allow himself to be voted out at the final five so Lacina (who ended up not even making it to the end) could pad her resume was probably the worst. I just know </span><a href=\"https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/survivor-35-finale-chrissy-hofbeck-ben-driebergen-twist-news/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrissy Hofbeck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was jumping out of her seat when Driebergen literally gave up his game to make a friend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After critics panned “Survivor: South Pacific” for having a below-average cast, I was glad that  Clarke returned to the game and proved she was a great winner. She played a smart under-the-radar game; “Survivor” host Jeff Probst said, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eeidwtQT_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“so many times you forget she’s there. She’s really good at that.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She was so invisible that Apostol forgot her name in one confessional when listing players: “People like Wendell, Nick, Yul, and … I don’t even know who the last one is. Sophie. So under the radar that I did not even know her name.” In the same episode, he was voted out. Sophie voodoo is real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season was a trial run for fire tokens, an in-game currency that allows people to buy advantages. As a whole, I didn’t think they served much purpose other than to give more screen time to the “Edge of Extinction,” but at least it was an interesting concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ill-fated and fan-hated “Edge of Extinction” returned, the theme from two seasons ago that allowed eliminated players to stay and starve in “Survivor” purgatory, with two chances to get back into the game. After being voted out first, Anderson returned to the game at the final six.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anderson </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the “Edge of Extinction.” She found advantages, disadvantages and completed all the required grueling tasks, like running around the island 20 times (on very little food, which was a theme of the Edge). She, along with Shallow as a buddy, ended up collecting so many fire tokens that she bought three advantages: a jar of peanut butter and an immunity idol. “I’ve been grinding slowly and quietly for so long, but all this hard work is worth it,” Anderson said, moments before winning her way back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She connected with Fitzgerald, who was at the bottom of the pack, and they picked off the rest of the contestants and made their way into the finals. It’s always good to watch an underdog story; every time I counted Fitzgerald out of the running, she proved me wrong. She’s now the only contestant to play multiple seasons of “Survivor” without ever being voted out (excluding leaving early). Fitzgerald played a scrappy game, winning two immunity challenges and finding advantages, and in any other season, she would’ve gotten some votes. However, this came down to a race between Vlachos and Anderson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the final tribal council, Anderson pulled out her CVS receipt-length list of every advantage she had found and used in the game </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extorting Vlachos into giving her six tokens, sending a challenge advantage to Wilson, giving a tribal council advantage to Collins </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was commended on her dominant game in the Edge. However, she was criticized for not playing as hard once she got back into the game, unlike Chris Underwood, the winner of the first “Edge of Extinction” season. She ultimately played a good game, but it was no match against Vlachos’ dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting voted out second on “Survivor: Game Changers” three years ago, Vlachos had work to do. He edited his intense strategy of finding idols down to playing it safe in the beginning and letting people form a new impression of him. “I want everyone to get nice and comfortable with me; their guards are here right now [putting their arms up], and they’re slowly coming down … When it gets down to here, BANG! [punches] That’s when the sucker punch comes in,” he said in the very first episode. He held true to his words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, he was quiet and unassuming and then later got to work. Along with finding idols and advantages, he proved his social game when he convinced Collins, Wilson and Driebergen each to give him a fire token. He won four individual immunity challenges, something he had never accomplished in his original season, constantly worked with people on opposing alliances to get himself further and rekindled his and Lacina’s “Cops-R-Us” duo. It got him to the end, where his aggressive strategy deemed him worthy of getting the grand prize. The </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SandraDTwine/status/1260766588996902912\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queen stays queen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but “Survivor” crowned a new king.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season provided memorable moments, funny interactions and great gameplay to go with a fantastic cast. My favorite moments included Spradlin-Wolfe begging people to talk to her, Vlachos and Collins arguing over what a week was, Adam Klein trying desperately to play a decoration on the voting stand as an idol, the “Sandra Bench” and the all-inclusive family visit that ended with a giant thank-you hug to Probst. Shallow described the season as “a fan’s dream” in an interview, and I’m so glad I was not disappointed. Might this season be the best one ever? We’ll need some time away from it to decide, but I think it’s one of the best in some time.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.

These tech industries thought the cord of the standard earphones were essential to keeping them safe. Despite conflicting beliefs, AirPods have taken flight on our campus and have grown into a prominent status symbol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are much more expensive than other headphones, but they still have a special, attractive quality that elevates them above alternatives. With a price tag of $159, AirPods are a little more expensive than Powerbeats3, which cost around $100. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, </span><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/airpods-upgrade-2019-all-new-design-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16 million AirPods were sold in 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and approximately 55 million AirPods will have been sold by the end of 2019. This upward trend proves that AirPods will continue to be a desirable product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AirPods are becoming a cultural phenomenon and gaining widespread support. But are people buying AirPods just to gain elite status or for the convenience factor? With AirPods all around us, it’s difficult to distinguish the real reasons why people choose to own them. But I think social pressure and social status are a big part of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are still some who have not given in to the pressure, like Audrey Francis, a first-year communication major at UCSB. Francis says that AirPods are “expensive and unnecessary” and does not enjoy “the way the plastic Apple [headphones] feel.” She believes that on campus, AirPods “give you some kind of clout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, they mean a lot to people because they are an investment and allow them to listen to music. AirPods are a polarizing piece of technology and there is a continuous debate about whether or not they are even worth the hype.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, there is controversy surrounding Apple products versus non-Apple products. Some may say that Apple products are desirable solely due to their popularity. On the other hand, some argue that non-Apple products are of higher quality, and that the power of brand recognition means Apple doesn’t need to place as much emphasis on quality.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There tends to be a lot of backlash against people who choose to stick with the “inferior” technology, and many even consider Android phones to be lesser than their Apple competitors. Have you ever been put in a group chat with someone who has an Android? That person gets so much hate for the little green text bubbles that pop up on everyone’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">glorious </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone screens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tiny green text bubbles shouldn’t be linked to lower status but in reality, they are. There is always a small assumption that not having the most popular technology is due to one’s low economic status. Yet many fail to consider that even if someone is able to afford an iPhone, they may choose to go with another option due to personal preference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our society has advanced immensely in terms of technology. A phone itself is no longer a status symbol, even though it should be. In other countries, owning a phone — regardless of the brand — is a symbol of good economic standing. Instead of acknowledging the privilege surrounding phones in general, our society chooses to emphasize brand names and their respective places in the consumer hierarchy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major factor that influences people to buy AirPods is social status, just as much as function or convenience. No one wants to seem poor, so they go along with trends. And not having the cord of your headphones get jumbled with your keys might just be a plus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anum Damani wants individuals to be cautious when buying expensive Apple products and to not succumb to social pressures. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ad14fdb517f77521daf410a0c8d9515?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ad14fdb517f77521daf410a0c8d9515?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anum-damani/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anum Damani</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anum Damani is a mathematical sciences major who loves having conversations about astrology.

favorite albums. This is how I’d describe Cole Cuchna’s serialized music podcast, which takes one album per season and, quite literally, dissects it track by track, lyric by lyric.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show has four seasons so far: seasons one and two, respectively, are Kendrick Lamar’s <i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i>and Kanye West’s <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>; season three dives into Frank Ocean’s early career and analysis of his second album <i>Blonde</i>; and season four, dubbed a mini-series, explores Ms. Lauryn Hill’s <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </i>upon its 20th anniversary<i>. </i>The common threads between these albums are obvious: modern classics by enigmatic black artists that are not commonly analyzed through an academic lens. It’s quite amazing listening to the way that Cuchna pays attention to detail with the heart of a fan and the ear of a scholar.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It’s clear that Cuchna is a hardworking guy — he created “Dissect” while working full-time as creative director for a coffee company in Sacramento. The show was initially a passion project — he wrote, recorded and edited the show with most of the free time he had, somehow maintaining his packed schedule for the first two seasons. Then, “Dissect”<i> </i>was picked up by Spotify, and Cuchna was able to turn it into his primary gig. This gave way to season three, the Frank Ocean season, which put “Dissect” on a much wider radar.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">The show topped the <i>New York Times’ </i>top podcasts of 2018 list, sharing coveted space with true crime and talk shows. Before “Dissect,” I thought of podcasts as time for listening to news and murder mysteries — because music podcasts never got quite deep enough. “Dissect”<i> </i>is the show that I needed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Cuchna has always had a deep interest in music. He recounts his love for the music of the mid-nineties that was popular during his adolescence; he remembers listening to Motown and the Beatles as a child in his parents’ home. Then, he started buying his own albums and “gravitated toward hip-hop, then rock music,” he told me. Similar to many young music fans, he consumed whatever he could — from jazz, to classical, to electronica. He went to Sacramento State and got a music composition degree, which cultivated an academic voice that largely influences the tone of “Dissect.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Each episode takes a song and goes into technical details of phrasing, chord progressions and musical metaphor. That’s not to say that someone who isn’t well-versed in music theory couldn’t follow along — Cuchna’s patient voice can guide even the most musically inept listener to understanding why an artist chose to use a minor chord instead of a major seventh.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There’s a great deal of time and care that goes into crafting each season of “Dissect,” but most of all, there’s a lot of listening. “I will take a general look at the lyrics and play through the music on piano, just to see if there’s any connections there,” Cuchna says. He plays through the album on repeat while writing the content for each episode and listens to each song anywhere from 10 to 20 times. Then, “after that it’s just pointing out the most interesting musical features followed by a line-by-line analysis of the lyrics,” he explains.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">White men analyzing black music is a huge part of modern-day music discourse — and there always seems to be room for one more voice to add to the chatter. But Cuchna comes from a place of love, a place of respect that could not possibly be faked. He admits that discomfort used to come up sometimes for him when considering his position in this dichotomy, but it has faded with time. “I’ve learned so much, particularly about the black experience, through examining these works,” he imparts. “I wouldn’t trade that for anything.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There’s no sense of overstepping boundaries when listening Cuchna’s analysis of such deeply black works. Perhaps it’s a little awkward listening to him explain black slang to his audience, but that’s okay — it’s something that he is very good at.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The best episode of “Dissect”<i> </i>is a 40-minute feature from the Frank Ocean season, covering <i>Blonde </i>tracks “Skyline To” and “Self Control.” It’s a beautiful montage of Ocean’s possible inspirations — none are definitive, but Cuchna makes sure not to leave out any possibilities. He covers obscure 80s tracks and Robert Frost poems to chart what could have been Ocean’s thought process while writing <i>Blonde </i>and breaks down why these songs, “Self Control” in particular, are so moving. He plays each arpeggiating chord that makes up the soul of the song, breaking down the gorgeous melody that Ocean sings and why it makes us so damn emotional every single time.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Music is a glimpse into that unknown, an impression of the enigmatic, the shadow of a figure just out of sight,” Cuchna concludes at the end of his analysis – fitting for music as ethereal as Ocean’s.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Talking about music for a living is a dream job, which is at least half the reason why I listen to “Dissect”<i> </i>— I become more educated and inspired, listening to someone talk about some of the most important albums of my generation. Cuchna is one of the best at it, giving much deserved credit to albums outside of the traditional scholarly conversations around music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">How does a person make a passion for music their full-time job? “Do it for yourself. Don’t worry about results at first,” he advises. “Just get to doing the damn thing.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
