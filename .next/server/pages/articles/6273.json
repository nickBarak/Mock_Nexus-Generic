Here’s a piece of my heart, carefully wrapped up into 915 words, give or take. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long journey of “Evelyn’s Sexual Orientation Awakening” began in my freshman year of high school. I didn’t know many people when I entered that new school as a little 14-year-old with braces and acne scars. I had transferred schools four times before then, and my middle school best friend had transferred to another school district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then this curly-haired, brown-eyed girl sat next to me in my second period Spanish class, and the only reality I had ever known flew out the fucking window. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me seven months to realize I was in love with her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came out to my parents three hours after that life-shattering realization. To my then-love, a year later. Most of my friends, 11 months after that. Slowly, one after another, the people in my life began to learn that I, Evelyn Spence, was attracted to women – even while I was still struggling to learn exactly what that meant. Bisexual? Pansexual? Queer? Lesbian? </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been four years, and I have slowly become comfortable with the blue, purple and pink that accompany the bisexual label. I have the bi colors in hearts in my Twitter bio, a rainbow emoji next to my name on Instagram and a photo of me sprawled out under a giant ass-inflatable rainbow as my Facebook profile photo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here’s the thing: I am 19 years old now, and I am Still. Coming. Out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come out every day: When I walk down the street with my bi-flag sweatshirt on and meet eyes with the stranger crossing the street, I come out. When I call my crush “babe” in front of the Starbucks barista, I come out. When I hold hands with a girl at the mall near my house, when I make gay jokes to those I’ve just met and when I clip my fifth queer pin to my backpack, I come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out is a jumble of emotions and tears and laughter and brings on more awkward conversations than I ever thought were possible. I have come out to many people in my 19 years, but there are still those who remain unaware of my rampant queerness, such as my grandmother, who will finally know after she reads this article, and the coming out will begin again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a huge difference between 15 and 19 – now, students of UCSB and beyond, I am proud to announce that I am no longer afraid of coming out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posting queer and bi posts on my Instagram and Twitter no longer bring out that uneasiness in the pit of my stomach. I no longer cover up my gay and bi shirts with black leather jackets; I send my father pictures of myself in front of rainbow flags; I scream “GAY!” in the street every time I see something remotely rainbow related. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I very recently visited the Castro District in San Francisco. I’m sure you can all guess how that went.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am no longer nervous to tell the world who I am, and that is the point I am trying to make in this article. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those still in the closet, to those with one foot in and one foot out, to those who are terrified to even to be associated with the rainbow, let me tell you that one day, you will be able to let go of that breath you are holding – and yes, I stole that partly from “Love, Simon,” but the point remains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I could’ve said that to my 15-year-old self.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This piece is a summary of my coming out, but this is also an open letter to all of you who are afraid; this is a letter to those of you who are scared to hold your love’s hand in the street and to those of you who cannot tell your parents who you are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I am speaking from a place of privilege. I was lucky enough to be born to a mother who knew I was queer two years before I did and a father who still loves me, even though I know he will never be at peace with what he believes is a “made-up” sexuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my parents, I say that in my 19 years I have met people who place themselves on all levels of the Kinsey scale. Nothing in life ever fits into a neat little box, so why should sexuality be the one that does? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you – if you do not have a support system at home, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you will find one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I have found a family with friends who celebrate my queerness. I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find those people. Even when it gets hard, even when you can’t breathe anymore, even when it feels like your life has become tragedy incarnate. It may take a while – it took me four years – but happiness is worth waiting for because one day, you will no longer be afraid of coming out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pinky promise. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence wants people to know that she is a HUGE fan of the rainbow emoji.

Music artists have been “queerbaiting” for a while now, and the LGBTQ+ community is not happy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Ariana Grande is the artist who is a prime example of this dynamic: Her recent music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored” and her headlining of the Manchester Pride celebration this upcoming August have received plenty of criticism from the LGBTQ+ community. However, Grande is consistently open about her support and love for the queer community, so what’s the big deal here? What </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">queerbait, is Grande guilty of it and why are people mad about it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored,” Grande flirts with another woman, and the two lean in for a kiss that is never realized, as right then, the video ends, and the imagery suggests that the singer wants the couple to break up so that she may be with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not the man. This would be an adorable twist if Ariana was actually a member of the queer community, but presumably, she is not. Apparently, the video is meant to relay a message of self-love: The other woman was Ariana all along, and Ariana is celebrating herself. But this is never made clear in the video itself. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ambiguity is a prime example of “queerbaiting” — people in the public eye hinting at same-sex relationships, either in their personal lives or in their work, without confirming their actual “queerness,” therefore attracting gay fans while avoiding the discrimination that these fans face everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are angry when straight musicians like Ariana Grande depict same-sex relationships and they are perceived as fun, flirty and harmless by vast audiences. In real life, queer teens are still being called slurs in school halls, trans people are assaulted for their identities and gay couples still worry about what will happen if they hold hands in public. Queerbait is straight artists utilizing the shock factor of gay relationships for attention, without providing any real representation or advocacy for LGBTQ+ fans. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86743\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1320652399\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86742\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86743\" data-attachment-id=\"86743\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/is-ariana-grande-helping-or-hurting-the-queer-community/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=2048%2C1510&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1510\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-966939330-1549449240\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?fit=888%2C655&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86743\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=888%2C655\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"655\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=768%2C566&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?resize=1024%2C755&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gettyimages-966939330-1549449240.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grande will also be headlining the Manchester Pride festival this August. It is a sentimental moment, as she is returning to the city where the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing occured, and she will be representing a community that she obviously cares deeply for. However, regardless of her intentions, her name dominating a lineup meant to showcase queer talent, overshadowing the names of other performers, doubling ticket prices and attracting waves of fans —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether they are allies to the queer community or not —</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is extremely problematic. Pride festivals are meant to be safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people of all ages and backgrounds, but tickets will likely go to those who are willing to pay the highest prices to see their idols, not to people who desperately need a place to feel accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Grande is not the only musician who has ever been accused of stealing a spotlight that belongs to a queer artist, but with her millions of fans and followers, her influence cannot go unnoticed. It did not go unnoticed when two straight women kissed on national television, only for cameras to immediately turn to see the reaction of Spears’s ex-boyfriend. It did not go unnoticed when Katy Perry sang about hoping her “boyfriend don’t mind it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTQ+ love is not a circus feat, it is not something to be gawked at and it is certainly not something to be appropriated by those who will never face the struggles that come with actually being a member of the queer community. Grande and all other straight artists can certainly be allies, but they cannot claim to support their queer following while using same-sex attraction as a music video prop, or taking up performance space that should belong to queer artists. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Referencing iLoveMakonnen’s “Tuesday,” Yachty reminisced about the “newness” of his sound, and he thinks that other artists ought to create music that bends the rules. But more important for him than any rapper or musician, Yachty gushed about his mother being his greatest inspiration of all. Not only did his mother work two jobs to support him and his sister, but she encouraged both of her children to follow their dreams. “I well overpaid her,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how did Yachty’s ship sail from being a college student to a well-known musical mogul? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He brought us back to a time when he worked at both McDonald’s and Six Flags, stating vividly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that they “fucking sucked,” and he was ecstatic to get out of there. Between going to college and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making a new plan altogether, well, he did both, leaving college after a year to pursue a career in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">music. His father, Shannon McCollum, who is a dignified photographer, would tell Yachty </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stories about his encounters with the rich and famous backstage. Looking to be successful, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty figured he had a shot at being a musician, too.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94377\" style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"547971027\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94377\" data-attachment-id=\"94377\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/lil-yachty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=1200%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lil-Yachty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?fit=888%2C539&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-94377\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=764%2C464\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lil-Yachty.jpg?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94377\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Urban Islandz</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now painting his fourth somewhat symmetrical square, Yachty encouraged everyone to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work hard, even to the point of failure, in order to follow their dreams. Once an avid credit card scammer, Yachty pointed out that as fun as it was, he needed to do something more </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distinguished — and not illegal. He even holds himself to a certain standard. “I don’t drink, I never drunk in my life,” he said to the camera. His reasoning? He believes drunk driving will end badly (which it will) and ruin whatever someone has going for them in life. Quite a fair message, especially given his audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he became disgruntled by his artwork, referring to it as “the jankiest bitch,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yachty made sure to promote uniqueness and creativity, particularly in the music industry. “People respect originality so much,” he said. In an ode to 21 Savage, Yachty applauded the rapper’s use of murder in his songs, just because it was shocking and new.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently everyone is different for a reason, so owning your uniqueness is crucial. But having the newest sound or most outrageous lyrics are not the only things to bring you to fame. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist told us that he used to sleep on A$AP Rocky’s floor and even ran his errands just to be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">associated with him. In his case, it worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to the up and coming, Yachty rolled names off his tongue of talent that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shouldn’t be slept on. He said Duwap Kaine and Cody Miles are both really “dope.” In terms of his own music, Yachty teased the idea that he will be working with Joji, which excited his fans who had watched their conversation on 88rising’s YouTube channel. With new music coming our way, it was no surprise that “Act Up” by City Girls was mentioned since he wrote the entire song himself. Between eye rolls, he told the crowd he thinks City Girls are “very themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting a deep maroon square near the top of his canvas, Yachty listened as the interviewers brought up his infamous crimson dreads that made his image. Now letting his hair grow out sans bleaching and coloring, Yachty told the students that his hair fell out from over-processing it, which apparently he’s never told people before. The fans made do with the red beret he sported for the time being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And food: Now what could be more enticing than that? Yachty prides himself on never having eaten vegetables, instead opting for a slice of glorious pizza. Every. Single. Day. Sounds like some of us college kids, doesn’t it? When venturing to LA, he enjoys the local shop, Delicious Pizza, which is surprising because he claims to “never eat out, ever.” But in the future, he hopes to open his own pizza joint in Atlanta, so he can enjoy his “cheesy” habits and share them with the world, too (and, for the record, his dining choices have no effect on his flawless skin, which he claims to inherit from his parents).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Near the end of the Friday painting questionnaire, the million-dollar question popped up: so, why the name “Lil Yachty?” A group of people in school called themselves the “Yacht Club,” and when McCollum joined, he was the youngest, or the “littlest.” And from there, he was Lil Yachty (shoutout Lil Boat!). Currently, when he isn’t giving art tutorials to bored and quarantined college kids, Yachty is working tirelessly on his new album. Featuring female artists on the tracks, it’s sure to be one for the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finishing off his eight-square masterpiece, Yachty let us in on his love life. While children are definitely a must for him, to this day, he has never been in love — or heartbroken, for that matter. “I haven’t found the right person to create a person with,” he said to the anticipating listeners. And on the familial note, he let us all know he has no plans for Mother’s Day since his mother is hooked up to his bank account. “Every day is Mother’s Day for my mom,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to close out the hour-long endeavor, Yachty gave a simple yet heartfelt shoutout to the class of 2020 as they graduate with great success. Oh, and that painting, if you were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of such glory, will be signed and sent to our very own UCSB, to either hang in the UCen or be given to a gracious student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While COVID-19 pissed on the much-anticipated Deltopian bonfire, the A.S. Program </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board did not neglect to bring Yachty’s charm to the UCSB students. No Zoom class will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ever be quite as entertaining, or maybe even as educational, as this past Friday night’s Yachty art expo.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ed7f95f2d67f8a733bdf5a223c76186b?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hgeorge/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah George</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah George is an Artsweek writer for the Daily Nexus.

Spoilers ahead. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judd Apatow has long found his niche in Hollywood with films that drive their lovable yet woefully aimless protagonists to take a hard look in the mirror, with a dramatic transformation often materializing right before they hit rock bottom. With his latest comedic venture, “The King of Staten Island,” the director trades in his signature smutty jokes and raunchy shticks (think “Knocked Up” or “The 40-Year-Old Virgin”) for a more down-to-earth approach to themes of grief, ambition and self-worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is a clear departure from what audiences have come to associate with Apatow, as he taps Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson for a loosely based retelling of the stand-up comedian’s upbringing in the New York City borough of Staten Island. If you’re watching the movie as an invested fan of Davidson’s or are committed to watching any and all Apatow films, the 137-minute runtime may not be a big deal. When the dust settles, however, “The King of Staten Island” amounts to more or less what you would expect from an Apatow-Davidson collaboration: a subliminally funny yet at-times sluggish plot that milks Davidson’s life story for all it is worth. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson stars as Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old high school dropout who lives at home in Staten Island with his widowed mother Margie (Marisa Tomei), and his younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow), who is about to leave for college. Scott, who has never fully recovered from the sudden death of his father when he was seven, openly embraces his miserable existence and tendency to inflict pain on himself as he proceeds to wreck every personal relationship in his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott’s unresolved sense of loss surrounding his father’s passing, a fireman who was killed in a hotel fire, draws from Davidson’s own experience losing his father, a fireman who perished in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. For the past 17 years, Scott’s life has effectively been paralyzed, which he is acutely aware of yet comfortable ignoring. He passes the time  — perpetually high — by lazing around with his friends and hooking up with a girl named Kelsey (Bel Powley), who desperately wants to take their relationship to the next level while Scott is determined to keep things the same. His one and only aspiration is to open a restaurant which doubles as a tattoo parlor, to be named “Ruby Tattoos-days.” (With ink covering pretty much every inch of his body from the neck down, Scott claims that the pain of the needle relaxes him.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his mother starts to date another fireman named Ray Bishop (Bill Burr), who is incidentally the father of a little boy who Scott tries to tattoo in a park, Scott sees this as the ultimate act of betrayal against his deceased father and does everything in his power to break up the two. His mother, who finally wakes up to the fact that her son is a grown man who has been coddled for far too long, kicks Scott out of the house until he is better equipped to deal with his problems. Scott finds refuge in an unlikely place: the firehouse where Ray works, where Scott learns more about his father and about sustaining the relationships that matter to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In true Davidson fashion, “The King of Staten Island” tackles Scott’s serious underlying issues with abrasive sarcasm and laugh-out-loud one-liners, and it is his charming knack for self-deprecation that makes the largely forced writing bearable. Not forced, however, is Davidson’s acting — a pleasant surprise considering the number of comedians-turned-actors who have delivered lackluster performances over the years. Scott’s awkwardly dark humor and goofy facial expressions are so reminiscent of Davidson’s real-life persona that it is easy to forget that a camera is not just following him around as he meanders through Staten Island. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the storyline is simply not gripping enough to justify its lengthy runtime, the film genuinely translates as an inside look into Scott’s muddled, THC-infused mind, as well as into the forgotten borough which shaped Davidson/Scott into the man he is today. The casting seems a little uninspired — Marisa Tomei in yet another mom role and Steve Buscemi makes a gratuitous appearance — but they serve their purpose as prop characters while Davidson takes center stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you stick it out to the end, you may be wondering why this film came to fruition at all, since there is nothing that Davidson hasn’t addressed in his stand-up a million times already. Apatow, who has struck comedic gold with films that our generation will talk about for years to come, undoubtedly fell flat with this one. Some may find Scott’s childlike temperament to be too much, in which case there is nothing here for them. If, however, you find Scott to be incomprehensibly endearing, like me, you just can’t help but root for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 6.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
