In response, Fischer said some constituents turned to Hartmann and local government to ease their dissatisfaction with national politics.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the fact that her election coincided with Trump’s placed an additional responsibility on her office to listen to constituents and bring people together rather than divide them.</p>\n<p>Constituents from I.V. and UC Santa Barbara in particular would be expecting focused representation for their communities from Hartmann. When those precincts were counted, Hartmann’s votes took a significant jump.</p>\n<p>In return for their votes, Hartmann has had a busy and effective year working on I.V. infrastructure, public safety and support for the I.V. Community Services District, which has benefitted from donations from Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>She has worked to get the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) off the ground, giving the newly-formed government start-up funds, leasing them the previous Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office and giving them a space to provide programs in the community room of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Because a large number of the county’s residents live in unincorporated areas, it is Hartmann’s responsibility to represent those constituents, making I.V.’s self-determination through the CSD even more important.</p>\n<p>“I am always scampering around from Guadalupe to Vandenberg Village to Los Alamos to Solvang to I.V. to here in Santa Barbara. So now I.V. has its own government, and to see that begin to take shape is really exciting,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Fischer said Hartmann’s office is interested in “culturing conditions for [the] CSD to grow,” giving the new government an opportunity to represent its constituents in a way that might previously have been more difficult through the county.</p>\n<p>“We’re watching something very exciting be born and I’m delighted to be one of the midwives of many for that process,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board Chair Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday he’s had “nothing but good experiences” working with Hartman and her staff, saying she has always been attentive and willing to help constituents.</p>\n<p>“Without Supervisor Hartmann’s early support, we wouldn’t have been able to begin providing services so quickly,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office contributed $3,000 from their discretionary funds in the last fiscal year and $2,000 in the current year, he said, which has helped the district in their start-up costs.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the I.V. CSD has created an internship program in collaboration with UCSB’s Department of Political Science, managed scheduling for the community room and launched an expansion of the Community Service Organization’s escort program.</p>\n<p>The District has also developed a policy manual, hired legal counsel and acquired insurance, fulfilling critical steps in its formation.</p>\n<p>Bertrand expressed praise for Hartmann’s work in I.V. and said that the county’s infrastructure improvements have been especially helpful for her constituents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/\">The county Public Works Department installed a stoplight in August</a> at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte, citing a need to mitigate the amounts of collisions in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/\">The county also installed a sidewalk</a> on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road last spring.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Hartmann’s work on public safety issues through the I.V. Safe task force has helped people better understand the issues they are facing in the community through her focus on the data involved in these subjects.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said her office’s number one priority is to keep students safe and said she was pleased that this year’s Halloween weekend saw fewer arrests and medical transports.</p>\n<p>While Hartmann has focused on helping her constituents by attempting to support I.V.’s bid for self-governance through the CSD, a main focus of hers going forward will be helping the Community Center become a source for community programming for her diverse constituency.</p>\n<p>“We got a grant for $460,000 to add to money that the county had already invested in the community center, and then we had to delay opening the community center,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We expect to bring everybody in Isla Vista from different age groups, different ethnicities, different — not everyone will be students — and hope that we can create a stronger sense of belonging to the I.V. community,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said she also hopes to soon build a “pipeline” between UCSB and the county to bring students into the county.</p>\n<p>Despite what she said was a “steep learning curve” to the first year of her term, Hartmann said the work has been fun, and she has built connections with I.V. officials like Bertrand who have said working with her is a “true pleasure.”</p>\n<p>Constituents will continue to look for strong leadership in Hartmann and other local elected officials, as students and I.V. residents have shown that they are resistant to the changes occurring on the national level.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-80581\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sediment is made up of mostly sand and small rock mixed with debris, said Santa Barbara County Parks Department representative Daniel Gira. The debris comes from roadways, Montecito creeks and other affected areas in the Montecito mountains. A county permit calls for the disposal of some 300,000 cubic yards, which is the equivalent of 30,000 dump truck loads.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that the vast majority of the material is just sand and sediment from the mountains and creeks,” said Santa Barbara Channelkeeper (SBCK) Watershed and Marine Program Director Ben Pitterle. “In Montecito, certainly there was structural debris and some hazardous waste that was mixed into that.”</p>\n<p>The mud disposed of at Goleta Beach is currently being analyzed in a local laboratory for heavy metals, organic compounds that are byproducts of wildfires and aquatic toxicity that can harm ecology.  Results of those tests will not be available until later this week.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the impacts, obviously if it wasn’t for retention basins, bridges, creeks, etc., much of the sediment would’ve found its way to the beach in Montecito, under natural circumstances,” Gira said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Flood Control conducted an initial screening of the debris and the contaminated soil is being bypassed by the central landfills.</p>\n<p>Gira said local beaches were heavily eroded by the 2015-2016 El Niño season, so the sediment can be seen as a “real treasure,” because white sand beaches are naturally formed from catastrophic flows, floods and fires, along with the sediments they produce.</p>\n<p>This is a chance for a counterpoint the mud effects, Gira said, since the sediment offsets the ongoing erosion.</p>\n<p>“The county is doing its best to get as much of the sediment as possible into a littoral cell,” he continued. “And when put on Goleta Beach, it’ll work its way down the coast, feeding all the beaches from Santa Barbara to Ventura.”</p>\n<p>Littoral cells are natural compartments on a coastline that complete cycles of sedimentation. These cycles sort through finer material like ash, which is carried away and deposited at the bottom of the ocean, while sand is retained on the beach.</p>\n<p>“So, it’s a tradeoff,” Gira said. “So far, we don’t know about any obvious water quality impacts. Every measure in an emergency has been taken to prevent them. My understanding is that S.B. County Flood Control is also going to implement sediment quality monitoring of some type.”</p>\n<p>The SBCK has done daily tests for fecal indicators of waters in disposal sites as well as local beaches like Campus Point at UCSB and Rincon Beach in Carpinteria. Santa Barbara County has conducted its own testing as well.</p>\n<p>Pitterle said that as of last week, the county was no longer testing for contaminants. The testing was limited to visual monitoring for larger debris like wood or structural material, which is then deposited at different locations, including Ventura County.</p>\n<p>Wildfires can affect the soil and water chemistry by decreasing nutrient concentrations, such as nitrogen.</p>\n<p>“So you can end up with algae blooms in subsequent years and we may see some of that,” said Pitterle, referring to how the recent Thomas Fire triggered the mudslides by altering the landscape.</p>\n<p>“I think what people are really worried about right now is the mud and toxicity — we just don’t have any answers yet,” Pitterle said, “Certainly, there are bacteria tests showing positive results for contamination, so we [SBCK] and county city officials are recommending that people stay out of the water at those beaches.”</p>\n<p>Pitterle said the bacteria results are improving near Campus Point and the water quality has met standards in the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking now for officials to address the muds being deposited on shore in other watersheds along roads or on other properties,” said Pitterle. “We definitely want to make sure that agencies are implementing what they call ‘best-management practices.’”</p>\n<p>The SBCK is ensuring containment of mud runoff. That way, during the next storm, new creeks and waterways will not be contaminated with that material.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it’s getting transported — I’ve heard as far west as Buellton. It’s in new areas that weren’t even impacted by the fire. We want to make sure those areas stay unimpacted,” Pitterle said.</p>\n<p>Limited resources and testing expenses have been obstacles for SBCK when sampling beach disposal sites. Road closures have also made certain areas inaccessible.</p>\n<p>“We are trying our best to balance our environmental concerns, many of which are valid with also the status of rescue efforts and emergency response that were necessary at the time,”  Pitterle said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article was corrected to clarify that heavy metals are not organic compounds, as the article previously stated due to an editing error. The mud disposed of at the beach is being analyzed at a local laboratory for heavy metals, as well as organic compounds and aquatic toxicity.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Ross Trindle, general counsel for the CSD, said at the board’s Sept. 12 meeting that the court’s decision in the California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland case could create a pathway to a new tax for Isla Vistans if the board decides to act as the ruling seems to suggest.</p>\n<p>The court decision suggests that the board will have the option to bring the tax to a special election or vote on it directly at a board meeting if 10 percent of voters bring signatures supporting an ordinance proposing a tax to the county.</p>\n<p>If the board chooses to pass the tax directly at a board meeting, voters will be stripped of their power to vote. In November 2016, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locals shot down the tax</a> when Measure F received less than a two-thirds majority of the vote.</p>\n<p>A special election is a vote that could be called immediately, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>The ordinance voters would create is subject to the county’s approval and must outline the exact ways in which the tax would be collected and how the funds would be spent.</p>\n<p>Trindle said his interpretation of the court ruling was widely debated by legal scholars and that it is currently unclear whether the board would be able to take this option. He suggested the board focus on the issue in the “user utility tax ballot measure ad-hoc committee” created to work on putting the tax on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“I throw this out there because there is a very large question that is unresolved,” Trindle said. “There are legal scholars, colleagues on one side, that say the issue is very narrow… and there are media accounts and experts on the other side that say, ‘No that’s absolutely thrown into question.’”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> contacted the offices of Supervisor Joan Hartmann, the District Attorney and the County of Santa Barbara’s legal counsel for comment on the legality of Trindle’s interpretation of the court ruling.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, none have responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an organization that helped amend the state constitution to require a two-thirds majority to pass a tax, was “very disappointed” with the court’s ruling because it could be interpreted as a way to circumvent the supermajority necessary to pass a tax.</p>\n<p>“They’ve specifically come out and commented that this would allow for ‘collusion’ between governments and special interest groups to effectively back-door taxes through this lower-level of scrutiny process,” Trindle said.</p>\n<p>In an interview last month, board chair Ethan Bertrand told the<em> Nexus</em> there were plans to put the tax on the ballot in June or November of 2018 and said he was confident it would pass.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78801\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78801\" data-attachment-id=\"78801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/csd-new-tax-by-william-tracy-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD NEW TAX BY WILLIAM TRACY-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78801\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>William Tracy / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Trindle’s comments at the end of the Sept. 12 meeting, however, present the board an opportunity to essentially bypass voters and create the tax through a simple majority at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Voters last attempted to pass a tax in I.V. in November 2016, when it created the CSD through Measure E. Measures E and F were broadly campaigned to be voted on jointly, with E establishing the district and F funding it through a tax on the use of utilities in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Pressure slowly mounts on the CSD as it could be terminated if it fails to pass a tax. The bill that created the I.V. CSD, Assembly Bill 3, says “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>I.V. lawmakers will be weighing the decision to create the tax independent of most voters’ input or to bring the issue to the public. Some board members have spoken out against the move.</p>\n<p>Speaking on the subject, which was not on the meeting’s agenda, Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said at the meeting that voting directly on a tax through the board would give the public a perception that was “sketchy.”</p>\n<p>“If we’re as concerned as we are with transparency and due process, this is a novel approach,” Hedges said before being reminded by Director Jay Freeman that he was not legally allowed to speak on the subject.</p>\n<p>The Ralph M. Brown Act limits board conversations to the subjects on the agenda posted to the public.</p>\n<p>In a text message to a reporter, Freeman said he opposed bringing the tax to a vote of the board and called the possibility of using this new court ruling a “legal hack.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that if we are to raise a tax we should use the process people expect,” Freeman said. “Tax measures should go to the voters.”</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop. Agenda and other meeting materials can be found at <em>islavistacsd.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Language in this article was changed to make clearer it is not certain whether the court’s ruling allows for this method of creating a tax, but does not rule out the possibility. Trindle was also previously misquoted as saying the CSD should create a new ad-hoc committee, while he actually said the board should take the issue to an existing ad-hoc committee, the UUT Ballot Measure Ad-Hoc Committee.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/","id":3925,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3924,3923,3922],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
