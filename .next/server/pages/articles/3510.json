OTI is hosting a “Welcome Back” event today at 3:30 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where the four most recent UCSB participants will recount their experiences abroad and discuss the program’s impact on its alumni.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In 2007, current OTI Director Daniel Wehrenfennig — then a graduate student at UC Irvine — proposed the idea of an educational trek to the region. One year later, Wehrenfennig and 15 fellow UCI students and two faculty members left the West Coast for the Middle East on OTI’s inaugural trip.</p>\n<p>Upon his return from OTI’s maiden voyage, Wehrenfennig said the program’s feedback made it obvious that the Initiative had found a niche in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“It very soon became clear that there is really a huge need to continue that kind of educational response to the questions that we have to deal with on campus when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Wehrenfennig said.</p>\n<p>The program has since expanded to six UC campuses, but only Irvine, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz have sent students abroad. Two new chapters at Berkeley and San Diego are gearing up to send their first delegates this upcoming summer.</p>\n<p>During the most recent expedition, the student diplomats spoke with royalty and servicemen, including a former Israel Defense Forces soldier on one day and the prince of Jordan on another — and often met with up to six or seven individuals each day, covering a wide range of opinions on the conflict.</p>\n<p>Atapour, a fourth-year political science major and co-president of OTI, said that unlike many other campus groups that discuss contemporary Middle Eastern issues, the organization goes to great lengths to remain unbiased toward any single point of view or political opinion.</p>\n<p>“Overall, the most important thing is to have this outlet on campus that people [can] go to that emphasizes education and not political advocacy,” Atapour said.</p>\n<p><em>This is the first of three installments of the Olive Tree Initiative feature.

There’s something about nature that really gets my blood flowing.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it’s the fresh air and blue skies or the thrill of being caught pants-down in public, getting buck-wild in the great outdoors is guaranteed to bring out your inner animal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Usher isn’t the only one who wants a lady in the street but a freak in the bed.</strong></p>\n<p>Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin, so get loud, get dirty and don’t hesitate to rough us up a bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Toys aren’t just for kids — especially the ones you can find in your local sex shop.</strong></p>\n<p>From anal beads to vibrator sleeves, these XXX Toys “R” Us are bound (and gagged) to have something for everyone. Bring your man along and peruse the adult store’s various cuffs, lubes, stimulators, rings and molds together to stimulate each others’ minds and bodies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. I can guarantee nothing will make a guy’s jaw hit the floor faster than your ability to contort into a human pretzel.</strong></p>\n<p>A little flexibility goes a long way and opens the door to a world of crazy sex positions to hit your G-spot from every angle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Half the fun of having sex is getting to see each other undress.</strong></p>\n<p>No guy wants to see you in what looks like your grandmother’s hand-me-downs, so take the time to visit Victoria’s Secret and pick out some sexy lingerie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Your body is a temple, so put in the time and effort to take care of it.</strong></p>\n<p>Exercising and eating healthy are a major part of my life, so it’s important for a woman to feel the same way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Vaginas are the unofficial eighth natural wonder of the world.</strong></p>\n<p>There is so much going on down there and until someone creates a universal manual for guys like me, we’re going to need your help figuring out what you like and where you like it. Spend some time getting to know your body. If you don’t know what makes you tick, how can we?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9. Make your time with him special.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not saying you have to pretend like your drunken encounter at some party Friday night on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive is anything more than a one night stand, but I’m likely to lose interest if I think you’re just as content winding up in my bed as any other guy’s room in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>10. Nothing’s more of a turn on than when, in the middle of foreplay, a woman stops and whispers in your ear, “I’m going to fuck you so good.”</strong></p>\n<p>However, it really ruins the effect when it turns out they know less about the art of sex than my 11-year-old brother. Be honest with your partner: If you don’t know your way around his joystick, let him know.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/bed/","id":3507,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3506,3505,3504],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What Do You Want in Bed?: She said","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"1.

Especially after we’ve gone down on you and you’ve made the mistake of either bouncing our heads like a basketball or trying to read Morse code on our scalps, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea for you to return the favor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3.

We want you to let us be a whore in the bedroom.</strong></p>\n<p>Shit, we want to be a lady on your arm, sure, but we want to be a closet whore, too.

We want you to be aggressive and rough.</strong></p>\n<p>We want you to make us go insane to the point where, if the sheets are still on the bed afterwards, it wasn’t even worth remembering.

Oprah — in her infinite wisdom and grace — broached the subject with a dramatic and weighted, “Parents, brace yourself.” I never saw the full episode, but can only assume Oprah proceeded to depict a scene in which sixteen-year-old girls, such as myself at the time, were gobbling penises by the dozen. Within a week of the program, my two best friends and I had all received the “you-aren’t-doing-this-are-you?” confrontation from our respective mothers.</p>\n<p>I now realize conversations of this nature must have been as uncomfortable for my poor mother as they were for me. The moments before beginning this sort of conversation must be like standing at a precipice, filled with dread and butterflies. Finally, she would garner enough courage and dive right into the topic with what came off as little tact or consideration.</p>\n<p>“So, tell me what you know about oral sex.” What? Shit. Where is this coming from? Blindsided! What is the right answer? Should I come clean? Shit.

What do you mean? I know what it is. It sounds gross to me,” I shot back both indignantly and cautiously.</p>\n<p>At this point in time, I had been with the same boyfriend for three years. Yeah, we had been engaging in oral sex.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t our first time around the block with the “birds and the bees” talk. My mom had played this card before, and conditions were always the same: Coerce me into running errands with her, wait until the car is moving and doors are locked and casually bring up the least casual discourse a mother and a teenager can engage in. Every time I was overcome with nausea and carefully assessed my options — open the car door and throw myself into oncoming traffic, and/or simply break into a fit of guilty tears. I have to admit, it’s a brilliant tactic — the in-car sex talk.</p>\n<p>“Well, do you have any friends who do that sort of thing?” she pressed.</p>\n<p>“I mean, I’ve heard of people doing it. I don’t know anyone really well, though. Mostly the more loose girls. None of my friends.”</p>\n<p>Using terms she’s comfortable with was a strategy I had developed over the years. “Loose” to describe “slutty,” “rubbers” to describe “condoms,” “intimacy” to describe “boning.” It was important to make her feel comfortable and convinced so the conversation would end as quickly and painlessly as possible.</p>\n<p>“Good, because I’ve heard that kids these days are shockingly nonchalant about oral sex. You know, that’s something extremely intimate — like post-marriage. I mean, my generation really never even considered that as something to do except with someone you’re extremely comfortable with, like your husband.”</p>\n<p>Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ. She’s talking about Dad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fast-forward a year. My high school boyfriend and I broke up after his departure to college, and my friends and I were asked to junior prom by the boys in the grade below us. At this point, I had thoughtfully considered my mother and Oprah’s concerns, and decide to just skip the oral sex.</p>\n<p>The dance had ceased and the after-party had commenced. Before I knew it, Ryan* and I were in someone’s brother’s bed. I knew Ryan in the same way I know a lot of people in my hometown — our brothers grew up playing on the same sports team, and at some point in time we began to acknowledge our friendship, or at least acquaintanceship. Well, this night we got to know each other much better.</p>\n<p>Having only ever slept with one other person, I was surprised by how agilely he navigated my body. He molded me into position after position with the ease of a porn star. Earlier that night, his fancily gelled hair and awkwardly large tux subconsciously told me he meant business, but I couldn’t help but be surprised and impressed with his bedroom cool.</p>\n<p>Immediately after, as he hovered above me in push-up position, he reached toward his hipbone and feigned retrieval of something from his pocket. Granted, he was naked — there was no pocket. He proceeded to pull an imaginary card from his “pocket” and handed it to me.</p>\n<p>“What is this?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“My V-card. It’s all yours.”</p>\n<p>Blindsided again. Should have just stuck with a BJ.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In hindsight, I realize how out of touch I was with my body and sexuality in high school. To be honest, I often still feel mystified by the incredible variance in sexual comfort levels, and often struggle to define my own comfort threshold. I have friends who have slept with triple the amount of people I have and other friends who are still virgins. For some reason the common denominator is that we’re all constantly quantifying our sexual experiences.</p>\n<p>I myself have what I can only describe as a number fixation. Every so often I catch myself treating my sex life like a diet, and half-jokingly declaring, “I’m watching my numbers.” I’m also slightly notorious for demanding to know any new partner’s number well before the conversation is anywhere near appropriate.</p>\n<p>Although difficult to completely define, I believe the pressure I feel to keep my number low is a product of both internal and external factors. I will never claim to be immune to the virgin-whore dichotomy so often projected onto women. Somewhere along the way, media, cultural tradition, family and religious standards have told me I am worth less as a woman if I am “damaged goods.” I’m reluctant to admit acquiescence to negative misogynistic constructs, but I think it’s important to acknowledge the effect they’ve had on my self-evaluation.</p>\n<p>However, I’ll hand it to you, Mom. Sex is intimacy. Time spent having sex with a person belongs to only you two. Never are you more vulnerable than those moments in the bedroom. In my opinion, it’s important to acknowledge that sex is complicated and personal. Reflection on your own definition of sexuality is time well spent. Ignore Oprah, carry the V-card in your wallet with pride and own your number — be it zero, one or 100.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/oral-sex/","id":3509,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3508,3507,3506],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
