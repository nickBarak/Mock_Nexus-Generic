We lost Halloween to the cops and out-of-towners; it seems terrifying to even try to leave your house that week. And now it looks like we are going to lose Floatopia to the Santa Barbara county. Pity. But here are the facts: We destroy the beach, invite way too many people from out of town, get hammered and have the GREATEST FUCKING TIME OF OUR LIVES.</p>\n<p>Last year’s “Floatopia,” if I can even call it that, was a bust. But I learned something very important I would like to share with all of you UCSB students. I talked to someone who enjoyed Floatopia as much as I used to: a police officer. Yes, a cop. I was as shocked as you are now.</p>\n<p>“The reason Floatopia was not a go this year was because you were unable to get a permit from the county,” the officer said to me. “They are trying to play hardball with you students, and shut down the event forever. They are trying to control [students] and what you wish to do.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The next thing he said to me is what I wish to pass on to all of you students.</p>\n<p>“If you want to have Floatopia, your [A.S. Program Board] needs to talk to the county of Santa Barbara and say this: We are going to have Floatopia on the first week of April, or every weekend of April and May if we have to. You choose,” he said. The police officer went on to explain if we can annually get the permit for one day a year (not two or more) we will be able to have the event. But, if the county officials keep playing hardball with us students, like they did last year, we will have Floatopia every weekend until they give in. And I’ll tell you the reason why: MONEY.</p>\n<p>The county cannot afford to pay police officers and coast guards for overtime on this event multiple times a year. It is way too expensive. That being said, if the A.S. Program Board threatens this, we can have our Floatopia. If the county still refuses, we rally the troops, as they say. If they don’t give in, we will have Floatopia (or last year’s Streetopia equivalent) for a full month, even two if we have to. What else are we doing on Saturdays, drinking at home? This will stretch the county budget thin and they will give in, unable to afford the cost of keeping up with us. It is very simple, and I doubt many people would object to doing what Santa Barbara students do best: party.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-28/call-action-lets-win-floatopia-santa-barbara-county/","id":6223,"author":{"id":596,"name":"Bobby Henry"},"related":[6222,6221,6220],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":596,"name":"Bobby Henry","biography":"Not available","articles":[6223],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Michael B.

All praised each other’s films profusely and when asked to identify other noteworthy films of the year, three of the five directors selected films directed by women. A notable response from Cuarón about his filmmaking process was that he “had to have less control in the process in order to give him more creative freedom.” Roger Durling closed by presenting the five directors with their awards, noting the cinematic talent and diversity in the group.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 3: Feb. 1</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day three was one of the most anticipated tribute nights of the whole festival, with Rami Malek receiving the Outstanding Performer of the Year award for his performance as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the chance to speak with Malek, who arrived at the red carpet with presenter and co-star Joe Mazzello and co-star Lucy Boynton:</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you have any background on Queen before acting in “Bohemian Rhapsody”?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not like I do now, no. I think everyone in this cast feels like they could write their own biography about the band. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, it was just hearing the music and feeling the same passion behind it that we all feel when we hear a Queen song. I think it touches everyone in their own unique ways, but it galvanizes us. It’s a story that I wanted to be a part of telling.</span></p>\n<p><b>Q: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a certain amount of pressure with playing such a legend in a biographical film. Did you feel any of this pressure while acting?</span></p>\n<p><b>A: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, an immense amount of pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just thought that if I had the right resources and enough time, that there would be a chance that I could pull it off. I think when we get to be the face of these films — the image that people see — but for myself, it’s a combination of so many different forces that have allowed me to stand here and say, ‘I got to portray Freddie Mercury and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possibly </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pull it off,’ and that is due to the work of everyone on set. It’s everyone coming together and creating that performance that allows me to represent a film and not just myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malek was then interviewed by Feinberg about his career and background; Malek spoke about how his early gigs placed him into a category of “Egyptian roles” because of his ethnicity and about his initial struggle to make his mark in the industry. Malek also talked about his preparation for his role as Freddie Mercury, in which he detailed his admiration towards Queen and Freddie’s passion and comfort on the stage.</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 4: Feb. 2</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viggo Mortensen was honored with the American Riviera Award for his performance in “Green Book</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen was interviewed by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deadline</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> awards columnist Pete Hammond, reflecting upon his acting career. Mortensen said he decided to become an actor at the “relatively late age” of 21 but started educating himself on film by visiting revival movie houses, where he became inspired by “spellbinding performances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated that he was lucky to land so many minor roles early in his career because it allowed him to practice the craft of acting. He cites the “Lord of the Rings” franchise as opening the door for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortensen closed by remarking that the best result of “Green Book”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that it has helped people discover the music of classical and jazz pianist and composer Don Shirley. At the end of the night, Mortensen’s longtime friend Ed Harris presented the actor with the award. </span></p>\n<p><b>Day 5: Feb. 3</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glenn Close was first presented with the Maltin Modern Master Award for her performance in “The Wife.” Close discussed “The Wife” in an interview with film critic Leonard Maltin. Close stated that it took 14 years to get the money to make the film, but that it had an interesting script unlike any other project she’d done before. She also went on to discuss her performance in other films like “Fatal Attraction” and “Cruella de Vil.” Close was humbled when she accepted the award, saying she is “blessed to be able to do the thing I love most in the world.” Close’s dog, Pip, also made numerous appearances onstage during the tribute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that evening, a sold-out crowd attended the Montecito Award tribute, given to Melissa McCarthy for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” In a conversation with IndieWire Editor Anne Thompson, McCarthy discussed her early work in “Gilmore Girls,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reminiscing upon her first job which lasted for seven years. She went on to discuss “Bridesmaids,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Hangover” and her love for producing with “building a project from the beginning up.” McCarthy’s co-star Richard E. Grant presented her with the award and McCarthy thanked the SBIFF for “shining a light on these types of movies.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Day 6: Feb. 4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On day six, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variety</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presented the Variety Artisans Awards at the Lobero Theatre to those “essential to the filmmaking process who have exhibited the most innovative work of the year in their respective fields.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The award was presented to 12 Oscar nominees, including “Black Panther” costume designer Ruth Carter and “Mary Poppins” composer Marc Shaiman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of honorees is below:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barry Alexander Brown (“BlakKklansman”), Ruth E.

Each honoree engaged in a one-on-one discussion with interviewer Dave Karger, followed by participation in a panel discussion.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What all voters in the county should know is that there are TWO aspects to the North County Jail issue: one is the physical structure that is to house 304 inmates, and the other is the staffing of the jail once it’s built. The cost of the jail building is estimated at $86 million. The state passed AB 900 to assist counties in the construction of new facilities and will provide $56 million for the new jail.  </p>\n<p>The difference will be made up by the county, which could issue a $30 million Certificate of Participation (COP) for the rest of the bill instead of promoting a new sales tax.  The county presently has COPs to build facilities in North County that could have been used to build this jail.  A new half-percent tax is not necessary.</p>\n<p>So just what is Measure S for?  It is for $15 million for the first four years to support the construction of the new jail and to support the reconstruction of the old jail.  Again, this could all be done with COPs, not with a new sales tax.  The funds are also going to be used for the staff at the new facility and for maintenance.  Buried in the proposal are handouts of pork “earmarks” to all the cities, county police and fire and “other programs” to encourage the city councils and supervisors to vote for Measure S.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The present budget would be divided according to the number of prisoners in North County so the county would not need to have a sales tax increase.  The buses carrying those prisoners to North County courts every day will not be needed.  The county general fund can cover any added expenses.</p>\n<p>The proposed Measure S is supposed to be “protected” by an “Oversight Committee.” However, as with Measure A, the committee is loaded with people selected by the supervisors of like mind, so the members of the committee will just stamp everything as “OK.”  On balance, there is no need for Measure S if our elected officials would get off their hands and make an effort for the taxpayers instead of giving us “the sky is falling” routine.</p>\n<p>NO!

I am not going to bother</div>\n<div>explaining why such a statement is implicitly racist; rather, I</div>\n<div>will move on to explain why Palestinians in Gaza do not have</div>\n<div>access to proper medical services.</div>\n<div>You see, Gaza has been subjected to a siege imposed on</div>\n<div>Gazans by both the former Egyptian government (thus,</div>\n<div>Israel’s staunch support for its now-ousted dictator) as well</div>\n<div>as by the Israeli government; both Egypt and Israel “share”</div>\n<div>(a characterization not at all appropriate given that the</div>\n<div>Palestinians are completely left out of the equation) borders</div>\n<div>with Gaza. From 2005 until now — as well as during</div>\n<div>Operation Cast Lead, which killed 1,400 Palestinians and</div>\n<div>injured around 5,000 — Gazans have been denied freedom</div>\n<div>of mobility to cross these borders. Medical equipment has</div>\n<div>also been barred from entering Gaza; in effect, infringing</div>\n<div>upon the right of Palestinians to maintain their hospitals and,</div>\n<div>thus, their health and livelihoods.</div>\n<div>On Feb. 10 of this year, Israeli strikes destroyed a medical</div>\n<div>storage building as well as damaged a school in Gaza. This</div>\n<div>is just one instance of a consistent attempt on the part of the</div>\n<div>Israelis to hinder development and undermine the building</div>\n<div>of infrastructure in Palestine (Gaza included) to aid the wellbeing</div>\n<div>of those who are essentially living in an open-air prison</div>\n<div>facility. It is one of many instances that demonstrates the</div>\n<div>perpetuation of an environment where the needed resources</div>\n<div>to create self-sustainability and an economy on which they</div>\n<div>are able to thrive is denied</div>\n<div>to them. The Palestinians are</div>\n<div>unwanted, as their existence</div>\n<div>makes evident the nature of</div>\n<div>the Israeli state as a colonizing</div>\n<div>entity carrying out an ethnic</div>\n<div>cleansing of the indigenous</div>\n<div>people whose lands they have</div>\n<div>stolen.</div>\n<div>As Laila el-Haddad puts it,</div>\n<div>“So long as those in power in</div>\n<div>Palestine are not willing collaborators</div>\n<div>in their own imprisonment,</div>\n<div>the consequences will</div>\n<div>be fierce: Institutions will be</div>\n<div>destroyed, development and</div>\n<div>prosperity will be blocked</div>\n<div>and the pretext will always be</div>\n<div>security.” To elaborate, Time</div>\n<div>magazine’s Tim McGirk</div>\n<div>reported that Israel was blocking</div>\n<div>medical aid from reaching</div>\n<div>Gaza and shed light on the</div>\n<div>case of Bassam al-Wahedi,</div>\n<div>who was in need of serious eye</div>\n<div>care. The equipment needed</div>\n<div>to conduct “complicated surgeries”</div>\n<div>was and continues to</div>\n<div>be barred from entering Gaza.</div>\n<div>Al-Wahedi was offered medical treatment by Israel if he</div>\n<div>agreed to work for the Israelis. Collaborate with us for two</div>\n<div>weeks, they told him, and we’ll get you the best Israeli doctor</div>\n<div>out there. If he refused to collaborate, he would be denied</div>\n<div>access. Al-Wahedi could not bring himself to collaborate</div>\n<div>with the Israeli state to aid his people’s oppression. He</div>\n<div>recounted that “his father, an ambulance driver, was clearing</div>\n<div>away wounded Palestinians after a battle when he was shot</div>\n<div>dead by an Israeli sniper.” This is yet another example as to</div>\n<div>why Palestinian medical services are “inferior” to those of</div>\n<div>their colonizer, the Israeli state.</div>\n<div>The bombing of Palestinian hospitals by the Israeli</div>\n<div>Defense Force during Operation Cast Lead contributed to</div>\n<div>the lack of available medical care within Gaza; this should</div>\n<div>go without saying. Of course, all this contradicts the pretty</div>\n<div>portrait of the Israeli state painted by the various authors of</div>\n<div>the many pro-Israel pieces that have been published by the</div>\n<div>Nexus; there is an assumption within all these pieces that</div>\n<div>Palestinians are to be blamed for their suffering; that their</div>\n<div>suffering is somehow warranted by the fact that Israel is</div>\n<div>an ally of the U.S. and an example of “Western progress”</div>\n<div>and “civilization.” One of the founders of Zionist thought,</div>\n<div>Theodor Herzl, would have been proud. He, too, asserted</div>\n<div>that Israel would act as “a rampart of Europe against Asia,</div>\n<div>an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism.” It is telling</div>\n<div>to know that many supporters of Israel have followed the</div>\n<div>racist tradition of Zionism, as they use Eurocentric concepts</div>\n<div>of industrial “progress” and technological innovations to justify</div>\n<div>a massacre. God help us in a world where massacres are</div>\n<div>embraced as civil and ethnic cleansing is considered an act of</div>\n<div>progress.</div>\n<div><em>Noor Aljawad is a second-year Middle East studies and feminist</em></div>\n<div><em>studies double major.</em></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services-2/","id":6222,"author":{"id":591,"name":"Noor Aljawad"},"related":[6221,6220,6219],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
