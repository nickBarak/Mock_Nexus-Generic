Such house. Wow. All these words can describe the experience of listening to Shiba San, the enigmatic French DJ whose dirty basslines have garnered him a momentous rise in recognition over this past year. This Sunday, he takes his talents to downtown Santa Barbara’s own SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club.</p>\n<p>Though he’s been involved in music production for years, 2015 has seen Shiba’s rise as a successful DJ and performer in his own rite. His hit single “Okay” has blown up the club circuit this year, being spun nightly on international stages by DJs both underground and world-renowned. The song no doubt owes its dance floor ubiquity in part to record label Dirtybird, known for emblematic artists of the house scene like Claude VonStroke and Justin Martin. That said, the jam’s snazzy claps and bone-vibrating bass speak for themselves; Shiba’s music promises to bring the underground club energy to any venue.</p>\n<p>SOhO should prove the perfect site for this transmutation. Aided by a small stage and intimate atmosphere, Shiba’s show is set to bring the Euro house scene to life right here on the left coast. Shiba is going strong on his first U.S. tour, and Santa Barbara counts itself lucky to be on the list of his planned cities. The added impact of the personal that SOhO brings to the table means that show attendees can count themselves even luckier.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

electronic music enthusiasts pack up their warmest layers of clothing and journey to the white glistening snow of Lake Tahoe Community College to attend a three-day musical festival known as SnowGlobe. Freezing temperatures hit as low as two degrees on an average night, but the cold did not stop festivalgoers from preparing to blow their minds with electrifying sets from the world’s top EDM artists. The 2015 line up drew a pool of veteran DJs from Diplo and Skrillex’s Jack Ü to Kaskade, as well as up and coming underground musicians such as Lil Dicky and Hippie Sabotage.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> was blessed enough to spend three shivering yet incredible nights in Tahoe and experience some of the best electronic music to be offered. Here are some highlights from SnowGlobe 2015:</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Galantis</p>\n<p>The DJ duo, Christian “Bloodshy” Karlsson and Linus Eklöw, are not strangers to the music world. For most of their early careers, Karlsson and Eklow were producers to some of the biggest pop star names. Having worked with Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Usher, just to name a few, the Swedish duo has achieved successes in both songwriting and music producing. Karlsson is most notably known for penning Spears’ hit “Toxic”. Galantis dropped their new single, “Runaway (U+I)” from their new album in 2014, and the song instantly become an international success; receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. Their tear-inducing set (fact) began and ended with their most known songs, but favorites such as “Peanut Butter and Jelly” and “Firebird” were also crowd-pleasers. Their remixes of Robin S’ ’90s hit “Show Me Love” and Enur’s “Calabria” brought new and diehard fans off the icy ground and into the air. While Galantis’ day one set was only the appetizer to the festival’s three-course menu, this reporter would have been pleased if the music duo were the only performers of the whole festival.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jai Wolf</p>\n<p>The Bangladesh-born, NYC raised Jai Wolf — born Sajeeb Saha — got his start by releasing bootleg remixes of records belonging to well known artists. Wolf’s success first came when Skrillex released the young DJ’s remix of his song “Ease My Mind.” From then on, Wolf signed with a record company and started working closely with guys of Odesza, reworking some of the band’s most listened to remixes. In 2015, the new DJ released his first original production titled “Indian Summer.” SoundCloud fans surely contributed to Wolf becoming a festival sensation, as he played his own set all around the U.S. at Coachella, SXSW and Hard Summer. At SnowGlobe, the New York native braved the Tahoe cold to bring one of the most fun and energetic sets. Mixing in trap beats to hip-hop songs such as Drake’s “Hotline Bling” and Travis Scott’s “Antidote,” the crowd moshed from side to side as the musician twisted his turntable. Jai Wolf seems to know exactly what EDM fans want, and at the age of only 23, he has a long and promising career ahead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat</p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat is a legend, or if he is not yet, he will be soon. His set at SnowGlobe was and is one of the best sets anyone has experienced in a long, long time. The Norwegian-born music DJ/producer got his start by representing his country at international DJ competitions by the name of DJ Final. By the age of 25, the young artist had gained awareness by remixing and editing his own versions of songs by 2 Chainz, Jeremih and Lana Del Rey. In 2012, Cashmere Cat — born Magnus Høiberg — dropped his first EP, <em>Mirror Maru</em>. The EP tracks evoke electro-tempo and abstract beats that are intriguing and addicting to the human ear. Music reviewers have gone so far as to consider Cat’s music an entire different genre itself. Credited as a producer on Ariana Grande’s album <em>Honeymoon</em>, the 28-year-old became a sought-after music producer for top artists (Cat is working with Kanye West on his new album).</p>\n<p>During his set, Cashmere Cat mixed in ’90s R&amp;B hits to current radio chart-toppers surprisingly well. But the real gems were the producer’s classic mixes of Miguel’s “Do You” and his collaboration with DJ Mustard “Ice Rink.” His final song, a remix of the old school Usher ft.

With no shortage of collaborations and multi-disc concept albums, it is hard for MCs and producers to stand out or be truly innovative. That is, unless the MCs in question are Eligh and The Grouch. In 2014 the duo released something unprecedented in the hip hop universe: a triple-disc album entitled <em>The Tortoise and the Crow. </em>It includes a collaborative disc of the two called <em>333</em>, a solo disc by The Grouch called<em> Lighthouses</em> and a solo disc from Eligh called <em>Nomads.</em> <em>The Tortoise and the Crow </em>received widespread critical acclaim, even debuting at No.1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The Grouch and Eligh, often referred to as G&amp;E, have been touring extensively since this release, and on Friday, Dec. 4 they’ll be playing an all-ages show at the Velvet Jones in downtown Santa Barbara. Doors open at 8:00 p.m. and tickets are $20.</p>\n<p>The Grouch and Eligh have a massive discography they’ll be playing from in addition to their already lengthy latest album. Even as solo artists outside G&amp;E, the two have been extremely prolific.</p>\n<p>The Grouch was born and raised in Oakland and was molded by the underground hip hop scene in the Bay Area. This inspired him to break into music himself, and he began what would be a life-long journey into the world of music in 1994. He released at least one solo album every year from 1995 until 2000. He still releases music as a solo artist but has slowed down considerably due to the amount of collaborating he does with Eligh and other rap collectives. To date, The Grouch has released 17 solo albums.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Grouch met Eligh in the late 1990s when Eligh moved from Los Angeles to the Bay Area. They became fast friends, and it became obvious that they had chemistry in the studio. Since then the duo have released five albums, the most recent being <em>333</em>, the collaborative disc from <em>The Tortoise and the Crow.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to his work with The Grouch, Eligh has a multitude of solo albums under his belt. Eligh began making music as a high schooler in the early 1990s in Los Angeles and since then hasn’t slowed down. He released his first solo album <em>As They </em>Pass in 1996. Since then Eligh has released 18 albums, sometimes as Eligh and sometimes under the alias Gandalf.</p>\n<p>Something particularly notable about Eligh is the magnitude to which he lets his personal life permeate his music. In 2005 Eligh struggled with a heroin addiction so severe it almost took his life. He checked himself into a treatment center and since then has been strictly straight-edge, free from all drugs and alcohol for the last decade. Many of Eligh’s solo albums reflect this, and his music since 2005 has been especially personal and inspiring for many. The list of artists he’s worked with is also impressive, including names such as Company Flow, Pretty Lights and even John Cena.</p>\n<p>Whether they play music from any of their combined 35 solo albums or from their five collaborative efforts, the show The Grouch and Eligh put on is sure to satisfy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hefdWgnkyU&amp;spfreload=10</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/","id":6835,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6834,6833,6832],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
