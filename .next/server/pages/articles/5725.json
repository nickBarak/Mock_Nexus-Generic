In a roller coaster ride of show, he takes (retaliatory) shots at ex-girlfriend, pop star Ariana Grande, shares an eyebrow-raising encounter with Louis C.K. and provides a more blunt response to the infamous Dan Crenshaw debacle that went down at “Saturday Night Live” last year. He’s brash, irreverent and pretty damn funny; it’s obvious that he has major issues, but you also know he’s willing to take jokes pretty far to make you laugh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you’ve ever laughed really hard at someone else’s joke and immediately looked up in concern for their mental health, you have a good idea of what it’s like to watch Davidson in action. It’s an experience all on its own watching Davidson struggle not to burst out into giddy, psychotic laughter between jokes (usually just barely catching himself). You feel like reaching through the screen to give him a hug and make sure he doesn’t hurt himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson isn’t quite as hilarious as I expected him to be, but he is pretty funny, and also happens to be very likable. Even after years of working at “SNL” and doing stand-up, he comes on stage with the giddiness of a new comic as his eyes dart around the room and his giggles roar into the mic at his own jokes. It can be off-putting to some, but it makes him come across as at least more authentic. If a joke doesn’t land, he just shrugs his shoulder and moves on, delivering the next punchline. His upfrontness, alongside his gruff New Yorker “I don’t know what’s going on” voice, happens to be pretty disarming and enjoyable to watch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson is also very open about his struggles with mental health. His father was a firefighter who died during the 9/11 terrorist attacks at Ground Zero, a loss that profoundly affected him as a kid. In a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJbqiHbusKY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Charlamagne tha God, Davidson talked about how important it is for him to be upfront about his darker periods, where he’s known to hurt himself and go on depressive episodes. His bluntness is a trait he carries on stage, making no effort to hide the fact he lives a life wracked by anxiety. Watching him be this real with his audience is impressive, and maybe even a little scary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To a generation that greatly values authenticity, Davidson’s voice may very well be one of the more sane ones to rise up. The smirk with which he dishes out petty stories and his constant giggling makes it clear that he’s having fun with this whole thing and proves that he does have a voice to contribute to the national conversation around him. This stand-up special is a chance for Davidson to respond and to take shots at people who have annoyed him in the past. It can come off as sloppy at times, but it’s got some really funny moments, and if you’re at all curious about the guy, this comedy special will probably give you some answers.</span></p>\n<p><span

virtual appearance on Zoom for an event held exclusively for Gauchos, courtesy of the Associated Students Program Board. During this hour-long conversation, the vlogger intimately discussed his rise to fame, experience as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and what it’s like dealing with crazy fans </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of whom crashed the live session by exposing her bare breast on camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board members Gabriel Reyes and Nathaly Pacheco moderating the discussion, Dobrik was able to answer specific questions of relevance rather than relying on the hectic chat room, which filled up with hundreds of messages by the second. Perhaps one of the things that got so many people excited was the appearance of other beloved vlog squad members who have been with Dobrik since the beginning: Natalie Mariduena and Ilya Fedorovich. Both Mariduena and Fedorovich grew up alongside Dobrik in Chicago, Ill., and now live with him in their shared mansion in Los Angeles, Calif. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jumping right in, moderator Reyes asked Dobrik what the first thing is that he wants to do once this COVID-19 quarantine ends. Known for capturing both his and his friends’ antics on YouTube, were any of us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surprised when Dobrik replied with, “Probably go to the bars. I miss seeing my friends drink in public places”? Of course, after earning a laugh, Dobrik quickly followed this up with a more serious answer, explaining that he’s simply excited to get back to work.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing the conversation, Dobrik talked about his social media consumption, claiming that he’s got a special place in his heart for one app in particular: “I am probably the biggest fan of TikTok, and I hate saying this because I sound like I’m some sort of hipster, but I promise you, I was using it before it was cool.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As moderator Pacheco moved the discussion from TikTok to Dobrik’s YouTube career, Dobrik emphasized how important the element of stress was during his rise to internet fame. Although he claimed that his original schedule of posting vlogs three times a week got difficult to keep up with, the stress that came along with it ended up being the perfect amount of fire he needed to become the sensation he is today. “Moral of the story is, if you’re stressed out, keep going,” Dobrik said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, things got fun and lighthearted again as Reyes asked if Dobrik could show everyone his infamous </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliemachadoo/status/1262958639427416064\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flamethrower</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a gadget often used in his more daring vlogs. While we may have been happy with just seeing the instrument itself, Dobrik took it a step further and instantly put it to use (and, honestly, I was genuinely worried he might accidentally burn his house down). The gag was over in seconds, with Pacheco commenting, “I don’t think [the Zoom viewers] thought you’d actually do it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his meteoric rise in popularity, it’s no surprise that Dobrik often faces fanatic subscribers, who apparently show up at his doorstep quite frequently. “People show up to the house, and it’s so fucking scary. We hate it,” Dobrik said. While some experiences are more pleasant than others, like the time Dobrik ran into a guy who ended up playing John B in the recent Netflix series “Outer Banks,” Dobrik said that most of the time, it’s just downright uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of his most “memorable” fan encounters (and I say “memorable” with a grain of salt), Dobrik explained how every fan “thinks they’re the exception” when they show up to his home uninvited. One fan in particular, Dobrik explained, showed up to his house claiming that he needed to show Dobrik a video </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a video on how this man found out where Dobrik lives, how he followed Dobrik home from a party and so on. “Those situations are pretty sad and scary,” Dobrik said. “Once in a while, people just show up, and we think it’s our time to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about DACA and his current view on the political landscape, Dobrik explained how he wants his YouTube channel to be an escape from the hectic world outside the internet and not a place where his audience feels divided. “This sounds so cheesy, but it’s so true,” he said. “I just want [my channel] to be a place where people can just watch videos and forget what’s actually going on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrik then recalled an instance when he was in Texas and met a number of students who are part of the DACA program, explaining how frustrating it was to see “everyday” people having to struggle when they contribute so much to society. As a DACA recipient himself, Dobrik said, “I have high hopes for all DACA people.” Although he kept his answers on these serious subjects somewhat short, it was clear Dobrik had much more to say.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the event, moderator Reyes added that his housemates (who are huge Dobrik fans) were all watching the livestream in a separate room. To this, Dobrik invited them to come join Reyes, where soon after, one of the housemates immediately pulled up her sweater to reveal her naked breast to Dobrik and everyone else watching at home. While most got a laugh from it, a few people on </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateGatsby/status/1263026527769251841\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> questioned the appropriateness of this act, wondering if it still would have been perceived as funny if it had instead been a man exposing himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this livestream was filled with several unforeseeable moments, Dobrik accomplished something great: He brought laughter and entertainment to an audience stuck at home during one of the craziest times any of us have had to face thus far. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Language differences aside, it’s also just one of the best romances in years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A French drama set in the 18th century, Céline Sciamma’s “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” richly tells the story of a relationship between two women. Marianne (a breakout Noémie Merlant) is an artist commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of an aristocratic woman, Héloïse (a terrific Adèle Haenel). However, because Héloïse is unwilling to marry a man she has never met, she has refused to pose for her portrait, running out another painter prior to Marianne. Héloïse’s mother instructs Marianne to spend time with her willful daughter under the guise of being her walking companion during the day so that she can paint her portrait in secret at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, nothing is as straightforward as it seems. As the two women spend more time together and get to know each other, feelings ignite and the tension between them thickens.

Set at a gentle pace, the film enables the pair’s romantic connection to delicately kindle — when they finally consummate their love, it’s earned. Particularly noteworthy is that their relationship is depicted with a female gaze rather than being subjected to the more customary male gaze, allowing for the natural, comfortable progression of their intimacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One aspect I especially enjoyed about “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” was its ability to allow the viewer to see through the eyes of a painter. Having not one artistic bone in my body, I admired all the little details I wouldn’t have ordinarily noticed but realized are so crucial to a painter’s work: how someone is posed, how their hands rest in their lap, how the light illuminates their face and even the finer points of capturing an ear on canvas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film won “Best Screenplay” when it premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, and for good reason. Sciamma’s minimalistic approach to directing and writing her masterpiece leaves just the essence of her characters’ relationship for the audience to focus on. With simple, yet powerful lines such as, “Do all lovers feel they’re inventing something?” the viewer senses the depth of their intense bond.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music is seldom used in the film, but when it is, it’s used imperatively. There is no score, but one isn’t needed. Moreover, the luscious cinematography and exquisite acting of the two leads readily provide enough to engage the audience. Haenel and Merlant play off each other as equals in the narrative and relationship, enhancing each other’s performances while solidly holding their own; the palpable chemistry between them sells the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is a mesmerizing slow burn that spreads subtly and effortlessly. You hardly notice how everything has been building effectively to a devastating, yet masterfully controlled blaze until it crescendos, rendering you speechless with the haunting ending scene. The film offers much to unpack thematically, presenting a new take on what it means to love someone, on the philosophy of love and on how love and art intersect. Complex and multilayered, it will have you mulling over it for days to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is a poignant, brilliantly realized story about love. But more specifically, it is a beautiful meditation on the memory of love. The film reminds us to not regret past relationships that perhaps didn’t turn out the way we hoped, but to instead remember and appreciate what we gained from them.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is currently playing at the SBIFF Riviera Theatre. </span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jacky/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-4.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jacky/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jacqueline Wen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jacqueline serves as the Science and Tech Editor.

Eddy.  Looking for a third member to round off the duo, Chris brought in his brother Enzo who juggled bass and guitar duties, often switching instruments halfway through sets.  Still under the name Jakob Danger and seeking a more complete feel, the band brought in Judd, asking him to join while under the impression that he actually knew how to play bass. And with the long sought after final addition, the band solidified its roster and recorded its debut album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chroma</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a collective effort under their newly established moniker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although producing a modest crowd turnout at the Velvet Jones, what was lost in numbers was made up in passion. With loyal fans singing along to easily accessible hooks and the entire crowd head-bobbing to the smooth listening that is much of the band’s appeal, Mt. Eddy created an infectious community, making the concertgoers experience less about watching and more about participating.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthems like “Song and Fury” allowed those unfamiliar to the track to quickly catch on to its lyrics and sing along. Heavier songs like title track “Chroma” seamlessly switched from playfully shouted choruses to Malaspina’s drum-dominated breakdowns all too suited for the crowd’s heavy mosh pits. Perhaps it is this dynamic nature that makes the band so appealing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the songwriting, the band said, “It’s  mostly Jakob, but we change the parts for our respective instruments.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performing two unreleased tracks from a three-track EP set to release on March 11, Armstrong said to the crowd: “We’re gonna try to play a new song that Kevin learned on the drive here. So be gentle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each member’s personal presence on both songs is clear, with one track relying on a riff-soaked chorus led by Enzo and another with isolated vocals highlighting the complementary contrast of the rugged and the soft from Armstrong and Judd, respectively.  With the expressive drum stylings of jazz-trained drummer Chris, it’s no wonder why every song feels so complete and every fan seems so loyal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between the gifts, pleas for their setlist and screams from adoring fans, the relatively new band seems unphased. As for Armstrong, familiarity with fame and big names in the music industry is something he has lived with his whole life. With an album mixed by Grammy-winning audio engineer Chris Dugan, who Armstrong merely refers to as “my Dad’s friend,” it’s clear Armstrong’s background let him get his foot in the door of the music industry, and his independent musical talent allowed that door to stay open for future projects.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this talent that created enough chaos to make the half-full Velvet Jones feel packed to the brim. With spilled drinks slicking the floor, sweaty faces shining in the light and surprise pushes from spur of the moment mosh pits, Mt. Eddy proved all you need is the music to forget yourself and enjoy the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With half the band in high school and the other half in college, juggling touring and school has proved increasingly difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all starting to miss more and more school to play shows,” Judd explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the impending release of a new EP, it seems opportunity for touring will only grow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branching out from touring with many of the Bay Area bands they are most associated with, Armstrong explained, “In Oakland we play the same venues with the same general bands. We just ask our friend’s bands to play. Now we’re submitting for different tours with different bands.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking towards the future and contemplating the ever-subjective concept of genre, Armstrong said, “We’re writing all sorts of stuff … I think we’re heading towards surf rock but we’re also not … We’re definitely not straight punk.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some time went by until they all resolved, “We don’t know. That’s the answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still in the beginning of their career, Mt. Eddy has a lot of time to find that answer, and as long as they keep putting out music, we’ll have time to listen.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/mt-eddy-brings-candid-charisma-to-velvet-jones/","id":5724,"author":{"id":665,"name":"Jake Einsiedl"},"related":[5723,5722,5721],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
