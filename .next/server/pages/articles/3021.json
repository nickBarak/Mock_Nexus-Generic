Its architect, Jeff Shelton, came during Public Forum to discuss the proposed plans with senators and shed light on the development process.</p>\n<p>Shelton approached senators in order to explain the development process for the Nest, which has already garnered student criticism. He also sought to relay his desires as an architect to create a space that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>According to Shelton, the building has been in the works for a significant amount of time and is part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a project designed to complement the Countywide Comprehensive Plan and Goleta Community Plan and meant to address improvements to housing, transportation, infrastructure and other aspects within the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“The planning department wants it denser in Isla Vista,” Shelton said. “They want to get more housing — more variety of housing — and the Master Plan shows this area being built up … It happens to be at probably the best corner of town here.”</p>\n<p>Shelton said the Nest will provide affordable single unit housing, rentable hotel space and commercial space in a way that fits with the existing community while also living up to environmentally-friendly ideals. Furthermore, Shelton said he sees this task as part of his duty to the community to keep the space lively and exciting.</p>\n<p>“My goal as an architect is to try to make it work in the community,” Shelton said. “Now, the community is not all built up yet, so you kind of have to look ahead to make it work … I’ve got to keep it livable and interesting for the community at that street.”</p>\n<p>Senators expressed concern about the way the proposed development would affect property values and local businesses. However, Shelton was unable to fully respond to these concerns since his involvement lies solely within the architectural designing aspect of the building development.</p>\n<p>Following Shelton, Public Relations Specialist for UCPD Ariel Bournes came to update Senators on the steps the police department are currently undertaking in order to address both the sexual assault and general safety concerns in Isla Vista. Bournes cited increased video surveillance, increased staffing and patrolling, increased presence of Community Service Officers and continuing conversations with Chancellor Henry T. Yang about how to best protect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“It’s an all hands on deck situation at the police department,” Bournes said.</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) Co-Chair Kaitlyn Christianson expressed her thoughts on the revised food bill. She said she felt satisfaction toward the revisions incorporated; however, she hopes that in the future the Senators will take a more inclusive approach toward the campus Boards, Commissions and Committees (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Christianson said much of her discontentment with the previous version of the bill was because it attempted to limit the amount of money each BCC spends on food yet did not initially take into account the different sizes of BCCs and the ways in which the groups use food differently, amongst other issues.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for Senate to figure out what Senate needs,” Christianson said. “But BCCs are so diverse … and we’re considered from the outside, which is the biggest problem I think. If somebody would have come to me first and said ‘Hey C.A.B., I know you’re a huge BCC … what would you want?’ I would say, ‘Okay, this seems like a fair policy.’”</p>\n<p>Senators unanimously passed the revised food bill.</p>\n<p>Christianson had similar complaints with the process of devising the A.S. restructure plan, arguing that it was not inclusive enough of BCCs and non-senators in general. When A.S. President Jonathan Abboud presented, he refuted those claims, asserting that he had made an effort to reach out to BCCs. However, Abboud said he recommends that Senators table the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I went to a lot of BCCs’ meetings [with people] who were upset, and I explained it to them … and we sent a lot of emails out … some people didn’t contact me and now they’re in a rut because they waited until five hours before the Senate meeting to read it,” Abboud said. “I would say table it anyways just so that we cannot upset people.”</p>\n<p>After some deliberation, Senators came to an agreement to table the resolution for one more week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Friday, March 7, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/","id":3021,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3020,3019,3018],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus.</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held their first meeting of the academic year this Wednesday in the Flying A room at the UCen.</p>\n<p>The meeting focused on discussions with University of California Police Department representatives, complaints of a lack of support for student organizations by the Rec Cen and an appeal for a new electoral process for Associated Students Senate elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson informed the Senate that there would be increased police patrols on the weekends in Isla Vista and on campus.</p>\n<p>“A couple things that you might have noticed or heard about that we have underway are increased police patrols over the weekend, particularly on campus and in Isla Vista Thursday nights, Friday nights and Saturday nights,” Olson said. “We’re really trying to make sure the community feels safe and is safe.”</p>\n<p>Olson also said additional precautions would be taken during Halloween weekend, such as the presence of up to four times as many UCPD officers and drunk driving checkpoints.</p>\n<p>“We’re pulling a lot more UC officers into the operation than we’ve had in years past,” Olson said. “Say like, last year and years before that there was maybe like 25. This year we’re bringing in up to 100. These are UC officers from other UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Olson answered questions from Senators regarding police policy towards people suspected of underage drinking.</p>\n<p>Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild asked if students were required to present identification to officers when on their own driveways and property. Olson responded by saying that students were not obligated to do so and would not be arrested if officers couldn’t prove that they were under age.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going tell you that you have to,” Olson said, “they’re not going to arrest you for being underage unless they know you’re underage.”</p>\n<p>Olson said UCPD was not looking to make students miserable or refrain from doing anything fun, but rather to simply behave in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p>“I’m not here to tell you that I don’t want you to have fun or do things that UCSB and college affords you to do, that’s just not right,” Olson said. “What we want you to do is be safe and make good decisions and be part of that success. I hope you know that and feel that when you see us out there … we’re not here to make your lives hard.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, members of the UCSB Cotillion Dance Club voiced complaints that the Rec Cen had taken action to make their club and its 100 members unable to practice.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Cotillion Dance Club member Letitia Mueller said actions taken by the Rec Cen to raise the price of renting rooms, thus making others unavailable altogether, has forced students to resort to practicing in unsafe locations such as parking lots.</p>\n<p>“This is dangerous. This is a liability,” Mueller said. “People are break-dancing in Lot 22. That’s so scary. People can break their necks, and it’s not okay. We need resource creation. We need a space to practice. There are no spaces for independent dance groups.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a push to change Associated Student Senate’s election system, plans to improve mental health services at UCSB and successful voter registration drives on campus.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated that the UCen Governance Board had implemented policies affecting the Cotillion Dance Club. That is incorrect. This department discussed in the Senate meeting was actually the Rec Cen.]</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, October 9, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56723\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56723\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/a-s-senate-convenes-for-first-meeting-of-fall-quarter/","id":3018,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3017,3016,3015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Divided Over UC Divestment Issue","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students for Justice in Palestine and American Students for Israel have set up signs opposite each other in the Arbor in preparation for a resolution regarding UC divestment from Israel, which will be...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students for Justice in Palestine and American Students for Israel have set up signs opposite each other in the Arbor in preparation for a resolution regarding UC divestment from Israel, which will be a topic of discussion at next Wednesday’s Associated Students meeting at Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>The resolution, if passed, would encourage UCSB administration to withdraw investments from companies that supply Israel with equipment, supplies and services that enable Israel to occupy Palestine. The meeting will feature testimonies from SJP, who proposed the resolution, and ASI, who oppose it. A similar divestment resolution consumed many of the A.S. meetings last year, but ultimately failed to pass following an intense 11-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, a second-year sociology major and member of SJP, said the group’s aim is to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to decide on what the solution is for Palestine. We’re here to stand up and to make it known that we do not support the oppression of the Palestinian people,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major and ASI member Ariella Plachta said although the issue was divisive last year, both sides share the struggle of defending their beliefs and having their stories heard.</p>\n<p>“I hope people will learn that this war, like any other, has two narratives, two histories, two peoples that both deserve full self-determination and every human right,” Plachta said.</p>\n<p>But in support of the resolution, Mirza said Palestine has been occupied for 40 years by the Israeli military, which has exploited Palestinians for their labor, while encroaching on their land to build Israeli settlements.</p>\n<p>“People are being displaced everyday. Bulldozers that we are invested in through companies like Caterpillar are knocking down the homes of Palestinians,” Mirza said. “This is something that has been going on not just since recently, but for years now. It’s gotten to a point where the international community has an obligation to respond.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year dance and psychology double major Lyla Palmer held a different view, saying Israel has attempted peace talks but has been turned away.</p>\n<p>“Over the past 66 years, Israel has made numerous concessions and efforts to bring peace to the region but they were all rejected by Palestinian leaders,” Palmer said. “Singling out Israel, the only democratic state in the Middle East, is highly biased and does not promote peace on either side.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said SJP’s goal with the resolution is to follow the same methods used during South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement from the 1960s through ’90s, which focused on economically targeting South Africa in protest of their racist practices. According to Mirza, the way Palestine is viewed from the eyes of the mainstream public must be changed.</p>\n<p>“No one’s talking about the need for peace within the Palestinian people’s lives and the need for Palestinian self-determination and well-being of the Palestinian people,” Mirza said. “SJP, a lot of it, is bringing that perspective and letting people realize that these things are taking place.”</p>\n<p>While Palmer said that the divestment debate would “likely stir up similar negative reactions across campus” as it did last year, Plachta said members of ASI remain hopeful that this year’s meeting will promote education on the issue, while avoiding the physical and mental stress that was experienced by last year’s participants.</p>\n<p>“Last year was a small catastrophe, during which, both sides of this tragic issue suffered emotionally, physically and academically,” Plachta said. “I believe this year’s meeting can be a productive, educational opportunity to express passions and concerns but will not reap us of valuable sleep and studying.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he acknowledged that while the resolution is partly symbolic, he hopes it will help get the conversation started regarding the situation in Palestine.</p>\n<p>“We know that divestment alone can’t change the occupation of Palestine, and can’t change the human rights crisis that exists there, but we can begin that conversation. We can begin working towards that,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/","id":3019,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[3018,3017,3016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

After Lau, OPP’s Guthy and Democratic Process Party’s Kaur spent an hour discussing topics such as campus safety, university affordability, their plans for aiding underrepresented communities at UCSB and their past experience with A.S. and other organizations.</p>\n<p>Lau’s plans centered on increasing the visibility and transparency of the Associated Students Senate, keeping senators on track with their individual projects and creating new job opportunities for students across various majors in hopes of providing work experience for students facing a competitive job market after graduation.</p>\n<p>With regards to creating more job opportunities for students, Lau said she would work to build more A.S. entities similar to the A.S. Bike shop but tailored to different majors. As an example, Lau said her first priority would be founding an A.S. Computer Repair shop, where students with technical skills hoping to work with computers in the future could both gain experience and earn money.</p>\n<p>“In this economy … students who go to a four-year university are not able to get a job afterwards,” Lau said. “In the end, experience gets jobs. …What I want to do is really create more student services to create these jobs.”</p>\n<p>When asked what Associated Students means to her, Lau said she sees the association as a means of helping students complete projects and make changes they care about.</p>\n<p>“Associate Students is really empowering students,” Lau said. “It’s something that we use as a tool to complete things that mean something to us. …We are the future, we are students and Associated Students really gives us that avenue to feel like we can make a change on not only this campus … but also the world.”</p>\n<p>After Lau’s forum, Kaur and Guthy took to the stage in order to answer the audience’s questions in their vie for the presidential office. Kaur has previously worked in the A.S. Office of the President, as an A.S. Senator and as co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality, and she currently sits on the board of the United States Student Association. Guthy is currently A.S. Letters and Science collegiate Senator and previously worked as Santa Cruz Hall President and on Community Affairs Board.</p>\n<p>Both candidates named university affordability as their top priority, as they both said there is currently a lack of investment in higher education of the state. Both said they would work to organize lobbying efforts with state legislatures. Guthy added that she, like Lau, would work to create more job opportunities for students as a way of alleviating some of the cost, while Kaur said she would facilitate quarterly swap meets where students would be able to trade books and furniture.</p>\n<p>As during the other forums that happened this past week, Kaur and Guthy were asked about Deltopia and their thoughts on what happened and who was responsible, in addition to how to move forward and prevent similar occurrences. Guthy said although she could not attend due to a student lobby conference in Sacramento, she felt that a lack of communication between students and law enforcement was largely responsible for the riots.</p>\n<p>“That event shook me,” Guthy said. “I believe that the circumstances that led to the events of Deltopia primarily were miscommunications between students and law enforcement … One potential solution to this is the creation of a police advisory board.”</p>\n<p>Kaur agreed that miscommunication greatly contributed to the proceedings, and added that there should have been a town hall beforehand to better prepare the community. Kaur also said she was wary of encouraging an increase in police presence in Isla Vista as a reaction.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe that we should really even have more police. I think that police can make certain communities feel unsafe,” Kaur said. “I wouldn’t blame the police either for the events that happened, but I think we need more communication … I do believe that we should be policing the police, in fact.”</p>\n<p>One area in which the candidates did not agree involved UCSB’s membership status on the United States Student Association. According to Guthy, UCSB currently pays $10,000 per year to be a part of USSA, in addition to the $150,000 a year to be a part of University of California Student Association. A bill has recently been presented to the A.S. Senate that would withdraw from USSA on account of finances. Guthy said she felt strongly that USSA is an important organization and network for students across the nation, but she said UCSB would still be involved in USSA through its UCSA membership and did not think it was worth paying the additional $10,000 to USSA each year.</p>\n<p>“Membership in UCSA gives us membership in USSA … so withdrawing from USSA does not mean we are not members; it means we are no longer direct members,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Kaur, who sits on the Board of Directors at USSA and who has attended every USSA conference since her second year, said she believes the association has been the “most empowering organization” of her life. According to Kaur, while UCSB would still technically be involved through UCSA, it would no longer be able to send a delegation to the conference each year, and therefore she opposed withdrawing membership.</p>\n<p>“USSA is one of the most important organizations in this nation. Student power can move mountains,” Kaur said. “As a board member of USSA, I actually have to say that even though we would be members through UCSA, there would no longer be a UCSB delegation, and that is a shame.”</p>\n<p>When asked why each candidate chose their respective parties, Guthy said she chose OPP due to its track record of creating tangible change, citing the grants they pushed for and received for increased lighting in I.V., the expansion of campus wifi and a letter-writing campaign to legislatures lobbying to stop cuts to the state budget that drew over 11,000 letters.</p>\n<p>“I was particularly drawn to this party because we have a history of creating tangible change on this campus that directly benefits students. … As president, I want to continue that legacy,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Kaur also praised her party’s tangible accomplishments, notably the A.S. food bank, and the textbook marketplace and added that she chose DP because she saw a strong DP presence throughout the year across multiple important campus organizations.</p>\n<p>“We are the party you will see year-round, regardless of elections. … We are the students who have been there, [who] have been at the front lines of change since day one of their experience here,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>The last question posed to candidates before their closing statements prompted them to describe how they had worked to aid underrepresented communities at UCSB. Guthy said she acknowledged that she comes from a position of privilege, but that she has worked for underrepresented communities through Swipes for the Houseless and would continue to educate herself and reach out to those communities as president.</p>\n<p>“I don’t identify with a lot of communities who feel that they are underrepresented on this campus — I acknowledge this,” Guthy said. “I really want to work by collaborating with [and] working for a future that, we all as Gauchos … can all work towards. … As president I will continue my work and outreach.”</p>\n<p>Kaur listed the several organizations she has been involved with since coming to UCSB that work to serve minority students, and said she would continue doing everything within her power to fight for the underrepresented.</p>\n<p>“I, coming in, was struggling with my identity as an Indian woman,” Kaur said. “It really opened my eyes to how institutions in this country really oppress certain people and give privilege to others. … I continue to learn and educate myself. … I believe it begins with education.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates closed the forum by asserting their passion and drive for the UCSB community and Associated Students. Voting begins Monday at 8 a.m. on GOLD, and the results will be announced the following Thursday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54906\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54906\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/","id":3020,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3019,3018,3017],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
