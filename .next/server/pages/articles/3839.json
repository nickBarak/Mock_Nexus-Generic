IVFP Deputy Freddy Padilla said the individual had passed out in the street after a fight. The victim was rushed to the hospital after brief questioning.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was knocked out cold, and deputies saw blood was on his mouth,” Padilla said. “The officers noted that the victim appeared highly intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>An hour later, deputies responded to another fight that began when an intoxicated man was attacked while sleeping on his couch at home.</p>\n<p>“The victim was passed out on the living room couch,” Padilla said. “An unknown male attacked him while he was on the couch and hit him multiple times in the face.”</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, the fight was instigated earlier in the evening when the victim of the fight assaulted the attacker’s girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“She was at a party and was kneed in the abdomen by the male victim,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Padilla said because the suspect fled the scene after the attack, authorities have been unable to identify him.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to two residential thefts over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Burglars stole a laptop computer from a residence on the 6600 block of Sueno Road at 4 a.m. Saturday morning. Later during the weekend, thieves took a camera, two camera lenses and a watch from a residence on the 6700 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>In both cases, thieves entered through unlocked windows or doors. Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her. Maybe she was being cooperative,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Authorities took the woman’s contact information and plan to ask the owner of the vehicle if they want to press charges at a later date.</p>\n<p>Officers handled a typical number of alcohol-related crimes over the weekend. Eight individuals were arrested for public intoxication and nine were issued minor in possession citations. Deputies also issued 10 citations for possession of open containers.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/","id":3839,"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer"},"related":[3838,3837,3836],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer","biography":"Not available","articles":[1122,3839,4807],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Did he think it was open?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Did he think it was open?</em></p>\n<p>Sun.

May 2, 12:45 a.m. —</em> Officers were patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive when they noticed an especially rude young man yelling at passersby.</p>\n<p>“Fuckin’ Santa Barbara fool, what!” screamed the 20-year-old man. When a fellow reveler shot back a response, the intoxicated man yelled back, “Fuck you, fool!”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista’s finest wasn’t taking it, however, and took the pugnacious punk by the arm. He responded by saying, “Santa Barbara, born and raised, what!”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara local said that charges of him challenging others were “bullshit” and told officers, “I don’t give a fuck what you all think.” When asked how much alcohol he had consumed, he responded, “A few.”</p>\n<p>Because the rowdy SB rep was both intoxicated and challenging others, deputies arrested him and took him in to the station. On the way, the belligerent brawler apologized and confessed, “I deserved to be arrested; I admit, I was actin’ like a fool.”</p>\n<p>The deputies accepted the apology but nonetheless transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that a laptop in your pants or are you just happy to see me?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sun. May 2, 2:06 a.m. —</em> Deputies responding to a fight near the corner of Camino del Sur and Del Playa Drive were flagged down by Highway Patrol officers, who said they had detained a man in possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p>The subject — a 17-year-old male from Santa Barbara — was sitting on the ground with a gray Apple MacBook visibly poking out of the top of his pants.</p>\n<p>The clearly intoxicated juvenile said that he did not know where the computer came from and that a stranger had stuffed it down there. When cops handcuffed him and removed the stolen item, he shouted, “I think that’s Erin’s laptop.” Deputies asked him to go get Erin. He agreed, but came back to report that it, in fact, did not belong to Erin.</p>\n<p>During the remainder of their time with the feisty thief, officers had to hold him down to prevent him from biting or spitting on them.</p>\n<p>The young man was arrested for public intoxication and possession of stolen property and transported to Santa Barbara County Juvenile Hall, where he was housed, pending a beating from mommy.</p>\n<p><strong>“I want to be a part of it — New York, New York!”</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sat. May 1, 2:20 a.m. —</em> While on a routine patrol, officers spotted a group of people gathered around an intoxicated female on the 6500 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>The group said that they didn’t know the wandering drunk, but had decided to help the sloppy single lady when they saw her staggering alone through the streets.</p>\n<p>When the officer asked what her name was, the 22-year-old said, “It doesn’t matter.” She proudly told the deputy that she was from New York, but also had a local address. Hoping not to arrest her, the cops asked if she could call a roommate to assist her home.</p>\n<p>That was not the question she wanted to hear, however, and the nostalgic New Yorker told them that she “hated” her roommates, “America,” and “this town.” She then shared that she desired nothing more than to return to Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Officers said they were happy to give her a ride, but Brooklyn was just too far.
