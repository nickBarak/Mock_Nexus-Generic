There were seven medical transports, also significantly lower than in previous years, according to the SBSO.</p>\n<p>SBSO attributed the quiet weekend to alternative, campus-based events, which drew crowds away from house parties and limited Halloween festivities to UCSB students. The Associated Students Program Board drew many students off the streets of I.V. and into the Thunderdome with musical performances by Fitz and the Tantrums on Friday and Snoop Dogg on Saturday.</p>\n<p>SBSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the Sherriff’s Office “credits the students” for the decrease in visitors from out of town coming to I.V. to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[The] community has been through a lot, and the students no longer wanted to risk inviting out-of-towners,” Hoover said. “We believe the students have a lot of pride in our community and had a huge hand in keeping the event local.”</p>\n<p>Hoover also said student organizations like UCIV working alongside law enforcement contributed to the relative quietness of Halloween this year.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing like students helping enforce the rules, and they were passing out safety tips and passing out water,” Hoover said. “They were reminding students to move their cars and keep in accordance with the ordinance. It was really great working with students this weekend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair and second-year global studies and political science double-major Dwayne Mosbey said the relationship between students and police officers was more positive than in previous years.</p>\n<p>“You could walk down the street and see officers playing Frisbee with some of the people walking about,” Mosbey said. “There was a record low number of [citations] handed out this year.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the two concerts hosted by A.S. Program Board were “incredibly effective” at preventing crowds in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The only time I saw traffic while walking I.V. was students going to the concerts,” Mosbey said. “I applaud and am so appreciative of Program Board for putting on such a great program this year with artists that the students just really wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the UCIV efforts received “incredibly positive feedback” throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Even when our volunteers went to warn people about the noise ordinance, their warnings were received in a very positive manner and they really appreciated what we were doing,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said organizations like UCIV help “shift the culture” in I.V. toward community policing.</p>\n<p>“These students were giving out warnings about noise ordinances and citations,” Dela Cruz said. “I’m just really glad to have seen Isla Vista safe and local.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said community events like Haunt-a-Loop, which invited local children to trick-or-treat on Pardall Road Saturday afternoon and early evening, were “really successful” in making Halloween weekend a more positive and community-based event.</p>\n<p>“That event to me signified a shift in culture — of students taking a stance and saying we want to make sure that the families and the children in our community know that they can also trick-or-treat in Isla Vista, that it’s not just a place where students are just going to get drunk,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said I.V. businesses helped collaborate with A.S. to promote a safe Halloween by providing T-shirts and giveaway items for a Scavenger Hunt.</p>\n<p>“Our local businesses came together and gave us free stuff and helped us enjoy ourselves,” Dela Cruz said. “It was a collaborative effort and students enjoyed it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrea Cisneros said over the past few years the police presence has changed the Halloween culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween from my first year was very different from this year,” Cisneros said. “My first year, Halloween was a big deal. There were still some of the same regulations — like in the residence halls we weren’t allowed to have visitors — but there weren’t that many police.”</p>\n<p>Cisneros said the alternative events UCSB planned were effective in deterring students from partying on Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>“Having Snoop Dogg and filling the Thunderdome on the weekend was a great success,” Cisneros said. “I think people took initiative to plan alternative events because they understand that not everyone wants to party this weekend, which was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Lydia Gil said the alternative, student-only events helped decrease the crowds in I.V. and kept out-of-towners from visiting I.V. over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“They helped discourage the idea that it gets super crowded here during Halloween because most people were busy with the activities,” Gil said in an email. “I think this will also discourage more people from coming next year.”</p>\n<p>Gil said this year the Halloween celebration in I.V. was safer and more enjoyable than years past.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was better because there were more options, like having two concerts and the roller skating at the Rec. Cen.,” Gil said in an email. “Also, there wasn’t too many people walking the streets, so it wasn’t that crazy.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major John Nguyen said although the police presence in I.V. over the weekend was alarming at first, he felt safer throughout the weekend with a visible law enforcement present.</p>\n<p>“I think students were shocked by the amount of police presence,” Nguyen said. “But I think the ultimate consensus was that the police presence made us feel safer.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/","id":4615,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[4614,4613,4612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo","biography":"Not available","articles":[2532,2553,2572,2583,2594,2608,2634,2641,2651,2656,2663,2681,3868,4615],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"La Escuelita and IVRPD Host Safe Halloween Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Safe-Halloween-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Campus organization La Escuelita and Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) hosted Safe Halloween Saturday at Children’s Park.

More than a dozen organizations collaborated to put on the event with activities like face painting, bounce house and Halloween-themed games.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year math and Spanish double major Sonia Acuna said the annual event provides a fun and safe place for local children to enjoy Halloween.</p>\n<p>“It’s a tradition to have it every year, to have a safe space for children to come play and celebrate Halloween,” Acuna said. “Obviously, in Isla Vista it isn’t always the best place to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, so we try to bring it to them even though it’s the weekend before.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year statistics major Jose Neri said students often forget there are many families who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. is very party-like, and it’s not a very ideal place for kids to go trick-or-treating,” Neri said. “Also, most students here don’t have candy to give out to little kids, so that’s why we do this for the little kids.”</p>\n<p>Acuna said Safe Halloween is made possible through the support of local organizations.</p>\n<p>“We invited them all to have a booth or little activity for the kids to play and have fun,” Acuna said. “It’s really awesome to have them here. There’s about 15 or 16 orgs here right now… it fills up the park and it feels nice to have their support here.”</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha member and third-year Chican@ studies major Cristina Cota said she and her sorority sisters were “excited to participate” in Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really great opportunity for children who don’t really have access to the typical Halloween trick-or-treating experience in their neighborhood that you would see on T.V. or that you grow up with in a hometown,” Cota said.</p>\n<p>Acuna said IVRPD, Community Affairs Board (CAB), and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) contributed funds to Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[IVRPD] covered a fee of about almost $300,” Acuna said. “We’re here because they helped us with that. I know CAB is donating money as well and IVCRC is also donating money, so this is possible with a lot of help from IVRPD, CAB and IVCRC.”</p>\n<p>Cota said it is important for students to be involved in I.V. community events like Safe Halloween during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for the community of Isla Vista because it shows that there’s a whole different side to us,” Cota said. “It’s really important for us to really nurture that and make sure that they get the best experience that they can, and it’s not just about coming here just to go to school, it’s also about giving back to the community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65772\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65772\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/65772/","id":4612,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[4611,4610,4609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building for community members to discuss benefits and disadvantages of various self-governance options for I.V.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, government representatives and other stakeholders weighed the options of cityhood, a Community Service District (CSD) and a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and Area Planning Commission (APC), taking the recently released Isla Vista Governance Options Financial Analysis Study into consideration. The majority of the discussion centered on the possibility of creating both a CSD, through Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), and a MAC.</p>\n<p>AB 3 will become law Jan. 1, allowing for the creation of a CSD in I.V. if it is approved by potential residents in the November 2016 election. If approved, the CSD will be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which will tax residents five to eight percent of their utility bills.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, cityhood requires “high taxation,” while a CSD would impose a more reasonable rate.</p>\n<p>“In order to meet the levels that we would need to fund the city, we would have to run the highest UUT and also find some other taxes,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>While the CSD formation requires approval from only 50 percent of voters, the UUT requires a two thirds vote. I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and long-time I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned I.V. could potentially have an unfunded CSD.</p>\n<p>“We may end up with a CSD and a board but no funding mechanism,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Asian American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said a CSD could create jobs for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“Potentially, a funded CSD could also fund student work,” Natarajan said. “There are people looking for part-time jobs that could also benefit.”</p>\n<p>MAC formation will require approval from the County Board of Supervisors, so many attendees of the meeting suggested I.V. attempt to create a MAC before November 2016 to begin the self-governance process before Third District County Supervisor and I.V. advocate Doreen Farr’s term ends in December.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Associated Students Lobby Corps director and fourth-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez, a MAC and CSD could function together to govern I.V.</p>\n<p>“If you have an AB 3-style CSD we would be allowed to have a MAC within that,” Lopez said. “They’re not mutually exclusive choices.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association Vice President Jay Freeman, a MAC would hold general purpose meetings and advise the county on various I.V. issues, at less cost than a city or CSD.</p>\n<p>“We get almost all of the benefit for almost none of the cost by going with the Municipal Advisory Council or Advisory Planning Commission,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while a CSD is more expensive, the benefits of hiring staff to manage I.V. are important.</p>\n<p>“When you say administration is a cost, it’s not really a cost, it’s a positive,” Abboud said. “A person is very valuable. They can help organize people and they can provide information. Right now we don’t have that one person that Isla Vista pays to take care of I.V.”</p>\n<p>Meeting attendees also discussed UCSB’s involvement in I.V. governance. Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said by buying properties such as Tropicana Student Housing, the university helps provide affordable housing for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We don’t need to make a profit on it,” Thurlow said. “The hopeful part is that we can create a market situation where it is harder for other landlords to gouge students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/i-v-residents-discuss-self-governance-options/","id":4613,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4612,4611,4610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Organizations Host Talk on North Korea Refugees","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Korea_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Korea_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara Delta Sigma Pi and the Korean American Student Association (KASA) co-hosted members of Liberty in North Korea (LINK) to speak on North Korean refugees Friday evening at Broida Hall.

At Friday’s event, representatives discussed conditions in North Korea, the challenges of escaping the country and how the organization aids refugees.</p>\n<p>LINK member John Park said North Koreans are “just like you and me” but come from very different circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There’s 24 million people in North Korea, full of hopes, dreams, families and relationships,” Park said. “The only difference is between here and there; they are living in one of the most suppressive countries in this world today.”</p>\n<p>Park said the Kim dynasty has convinced North Korean citizens of a “different reality.”</p>\n<p>“They tell them that the outside world is full of stress and enemies and they have to put their faith in their leaders,” Park said. “Their regime puts forth incredible time and resources to make people believe in their strict version of socialism.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, the North Korean government controls its citizens through censorship and isolation.<br>\n“To prevent their people from seeing the outside world, North Korea has an information and media blockade,” Park said. “They cannot make international phone calls, they are banned from foreign radio or watching foreign television.”</p>\n<p>Park said there is little resistance to the Kim dynasty’s rule because of the severe penalties in place for dissonance.</p>\n<p>“If you are suspected of defying the regime, they conduct harsh interrogation with you and your entire family and may place you in a political prison camp,” Park said. “The estimated number is 80 to 120 thousand people kept in these prisons, including entire families. We’ve heard the regime uses torture, starvation, and even execution in order to keep people in line.”</p>\n<p>According to Park, thousands of North Koreans have escaped to China since the 1990s as a form of “quiet disobedience.”</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the direct travel to South Korea is blocked by the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone, so thousands of North Koreans travel to China,” Park said. “But even if they make it to China, the Chinese government does not recognize North Koreans as refugees.”</p>\n<p>Park said if refugees are caught by the Chinese government, they are deported to North Korea where they may face forced labor and torture.</p>\n<p>“If they get caught, they will be sent back, and there, they will be faced with grave punishments for leaving the government,” Park said.</p>\n<p>North Korean refugee Min Sung said the challenges and potential consequences refugees face are better than continuing to live in suppression.</p>\n<p>“You only live on Earth once; I want to live it in freedom,” Sung said.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member and second-year undeclared major Athena Wan said she hopes people who attended the event will support LINK in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to bring this organization to my campus, and I finally did it in college because I feel like it’s a really good organization and, like, they have a really great cause,” Athena said. “Since we have the materials to help them with, I feel like we should all try to participate. I hope this event spreads awareness on their cause and their organization.”</p>\n<p>KASA member and third-year sociology major Samantha Chang said she applauds LINK’s mission.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad to see a group is doing something to potentially be political but doing it for the people,” Chang said. “I feel like it’s hard to convey a non-political stance these days. So their efforts to resettle North Korean refugees is really amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year anthropology major Connie Kim said the event helped her further understand the challenges North Koreans face.</p>\n<p>“I just knew that it was hard living in North Korea and they didn’t have rights, but I feel more informed,” Kim said.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Peter Dang said although the issues discussed at the event are geographically distant, the UCSB community should participate in a solution.</p>\n<p>“We can still make a difference and be able to make life better for people that we will never meet and for a cause that is important to those people,” Dang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/65773/","id":4614,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4613,4612,4611],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
