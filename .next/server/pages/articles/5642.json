Two-way, double-edged assimilation! Cultural exchange and such things!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a judgement on specific acts of appropriation, one seeks the answer to the following questions: Is it performed by a collective or an individual? Is it an act of control or horizontal cultural exchange? Is it an instantiation of a colonialist attitude or merely the product of benign ignorance? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The confusion surrounding the debate on cultural appropriation reflects the ambiguity inherent in these questions.These are important and legitimate questions to be answered by some visionary or sentient Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more interesting than the actual objects of the debate is the nature of the debate itself — especially pertaining to the appropriation of “foreign” cultures. These discussions fixate on the most visible markers of culture, and they are disproportionately driven by second- and third-generation migrants, as opposed to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">literal </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migrants and people who are native to the culture in question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to condemn or delegitimize their position. Due to their familiarity with the appropriated culture and understanding of the appropriating culture, achieved through lifelong inspection and maybe imitation or repudiation, it is often easier for this group to recognize patterns of appropriation. It’s easier for them to view the individual appropriator in the context of a broader tradition of collective requisition, of institutionalized theft, that essentializes and establishes authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is another factor underlying second-generation migrants’ passion for the cultural appropriation debate. Growing up in a place that is vastly different from where their parents or grandparents were socialized makes their relationship with their ancestral culture strained and remote. Familiarity often seems like the absolute limit of their interaction with their ancestral culture, simply due to the people they are surrounded by. In certain cases, “involvement” or “engagement” might be more appropriate terms. In any case, these are placeholders for actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">living </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in a culture. The cultural appropriation debate consolingly and perhaps falsely provides </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/29/cultural-appropriation-racial-oppression-exploitation-colonialism\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the possibility of an authentic, secure relationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with one’s ancestral culture. It offers a means of defending it, and therefore possessing and belonging to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the majority of those of us born to migrant parents, our ancestral cultures have always retained some degree of distance </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">geographically, personally and spiritually</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but are nevertheless crucial to how others perceive us. These include our parents, our relatives and peers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the white people who will always see us as foreign because we are not seen as white. And if it feels like you might never fully belong in America, where you have grown up, the natural place of refuge seems to be the place you have involuntarily left behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the country that is foreign to you but not your parents, it occasionally seems as if you are only a sightseer, a privileged wanderer. It might seem like you are not essentially different from the white tourists, the Westerners from whom you have temporarily fled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my otherwise joyful summer escapades to India and Sri Lanka, this remains a constant and terrible fear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the reason I love these biennial trips so much is that I get to spend a full month surrounded by people who look like me </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who share my skin, my arms, my bones. I allow myself to stare at these dark brown faces, at the dark brown eyes fenced within, and imagine them as mirrors. I’m aware that my intense concentration on these people is rooted in a precarious delusion. As soon as I open my mouth they will recognize me as American, as someone who is different.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When white people also involve themselves with these symbols, it can be distressing for descendants of migrants because they are a reminder of the truth: that they come from neither here nor there. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also recognize that I’m so desperate for a sense of belonging with these strangers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to feel like I originated from them or from the culture that binds them and my family together </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because it is clear that I did not originate entirely from America and certainly not from Americans, if these are indeed different things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ancestral culture exerts an intense gravitational pull and yet constantly drifts away. It is hidden by faces that are endlessly inscrutable and yet uncannily similar to mine. The language of cultural appropriation, a language of emotional violence and of theft, implies an unambiguous, rightful possession of this culture. This is acutely comforting; it is why cultural appropriation is the means by which descendants of migrants prefer to challenge the dynamics and parallels of colonization and dominance in Western societies. Guarding one’s ancestral culture and expressing resentment toward the trespasser is a method of coping with the unique, universal alienation experienced by those born into</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a foreign country to foreigner parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also something to be said about how the debate revolves around only the most visible markers of culture: clothing, accessories, food and artistic expression. Perhaps this is the limit to which those driving the debate are capable of relating to their ancestral cultures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migrant parents often try to socialize their children into their home cultures. Their intention might be to lessen their struggle to relate to their children and vice versa; to handle the distance from their own upbringing; or maybe to create a new home in this foreign land. I don’t think any of this is necessarily wrong or harmful, but when the children of migrants are surrounded by peers and teachers who do not share their parents’ culture, as they essentially always are, their ancestral acculturation exists only on a symbolic level. The idea is that if one volunteers dutifully at the temple, learns to cook the national food and wears the traditional clothes while dancing the traditional dance, they will be the authentic Something that their parents and their grandparents and their great-aunts were, or still are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this is not true. But perhaps it is something that migrants and their children need to believe. Because of the logistical difficulties involved in transporting all of the people who produce this culture to a new land, we have settled for importing their clothes, their dances and their food. These are things that can easily be transplanted halfway across the globe into an entirely new context, and still retain their beauty, if not their original meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For migrants, these cultural markers trigger nostalgia, the memory of a different world. For their children, they allow refuge from the ambiguity inherent in their identity. In performing these acts of tradition and cultural symbolism, they construct an ideal model of a migrant that cleanly separates what is American about them from what is, say, “Oriental” about them. They are allowed to believe that they are both things at once, rather than neither.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when white people also involve themselves with these symbols, it can be distressing for descendants of migrants because they are a reminder of the truth: that they come from neither here nor there. They do not belong </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because the white people, to whom this place purportedly belongs, have proven repeatedly that they would prefer to take the clothes and discard the person. The symbolism that is so fraught with meaning for second- and third-generation migrant identity is a vehicle for the appropriator’s voyeurism.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does my brownness alone absolve me of this superficial, negligent cultural-sightseeing?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This voyeurism serves as a mirror, however grotesque and warped, of the falsehood inherent in this unambiguous identity. It is a reminder that the way in which white people relate to your ancestors’ culture is not fundamentally different from the way you do. Their appropriation is really an exaggeration, an unintentional but mocking caricature of the way you have been forced to understand yourself. In this sense, the disgust toward cultural appropriation reflects a discomfort with one’s own identity that, in addition to being subjected to racism, is further muddled by ancestral migration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get me wrong: I enjoy trashing white people just as much as the next left-wing curmudgeon. But I also think it would be a valuable exercise for those of us who (maybe justifiably) seek solace in the cultural appropriation debate to consider what the concept really means, where it stems from and to where it should extend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean, for instance, that I keep a little statue of Vinayagar in my room next to my secular and absurdist monkey sculptures? What does it mean that I hang a Hindu calendar on my dorm wall despite the fact that I don’t believe in any of these gods? Despite the fact that I don’t know or care about any of the special days carefully mapped out on the calendar — this day is good for vegetarianism, that one for marriage, yesterday for especially frenzied praying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know which gods are which and why, but I like to go to temples, eat the food and look at the bright colors, the stone-gray statues, and the brown people. I would be irritated if a white person did this sort of thing. Does my brownness alone absolve me of this superficial, negligent cultural-sightseeing? Why do I have to intentionally explore these elements of a culture that I would instinctively call “mine”?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are Asian-Americans allowed to be so enthusiastic about creating artistic fusions between “Oriental” and “Western” cultures, when this runs the risk of essentialism and misrepresentation? What about </span><a href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/14606\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the co-adoption of hip hop culture by Asian Americans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Hierarchically unequal social relationships do not have to involve white people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wear a simple, black, sacred Hindu thread on my wrist that I do not know the name of, that I do not understand the purpose of and which is not at all sacred or particularly Hindu to me. The reason I care at all about this thread is that my grandmother tied it for me. I asked her to, impulsively, and as she tied it she muttered things, about my future, my education </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> words of faith and terror </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I did not have the cultural context to understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m often afraid that I lack the cultural context to understand her, even. Her routines, her habits and her rituals are more perplexing to me than seems proper. There are so many things that are available to me that could help me understand her: my mother as a human intermediary, Tamil as a communicative medium, the periodic month-long visits, the food that she is perpetually preparing in the kitchen that is solely her territory.  I know just about everything reasonable there is to know </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> besides consistent proximity to her and the world she occupies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the question that I am really dancing around: What do I think about Selena Gomez wearing a bindi? I think it says something about how we relate cultural symbolism to gender. Women are most often accused of appropriation and appropriated objects most often belong to other women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultural appropriation debate may not yield answers. It may only serve to illuminate the nature of the lies that govern them. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raveen Sivashanker is perplexed by fruits and vegetables with white interiors and exteriors of color.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88827\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88827\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/","id":5642,"author":{"id":821,"name":"Raveen Sivashanker"},"related":[5641,5640,5639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":821,"name":"Raveen Sivashanker","biography":"Not available","articles":[5642],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"How Defensive Architecture Hurts I.V.’s Houseless Population","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Politics","publish_date":"2019-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hostile-Architecture-e1559230185979.png?resize=650%2C464&ssl=1","description":"Andrea Dager discusses the impact of defensive architecture on I.V.'s houseless population.

Last month, they removed a large stone bench following reports that it was being </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/flintstone-bench-removed-donated-to-ivrpd/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“monopolized”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by particular individuals. While this may or may not count as defensive architecture and was ostensibly removed for the well-being of the community, the insidiousness of this action is hard to ignore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to remove the bench draws attention to the allotment (and restriction) of public space, as well as the enforced invisibility of certain demographics. If a supposed “monopoly” of the bench prompted its removal, then who is the bench being monopolized by? Are only students or the socioeconomically advantaged permitted to take up space? When is an area simply being used consistently, and when is it being “monopolized?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words: Who gets to take up public space and why? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surely it is no coincidence that the same people who frequently sit there are older men and women who also occasionally ask for a spare dollar and often make use of curbs and outdoor public spaces in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, the houseless population has comprised a substantial part of the Isla Vista community. A 2017 account from the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that I.V.’s houseless population consists of 26 locals.

It’s important to keep in mind that multiple houseless people either doubted this figure, or </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">refuted it altogether</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, claiming the number to be far too low. Regardless, it is clear to anyone living in Isla Vista that there is an established community of adults who are houseless or facing severe economic and housing insecurity.

It is no surprise then that the people most negatively affected by defensive architecture in Isla Vista are those who are most socially and economically vulnerable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covering the ground with spikes or placing a divider on a bench doesn’t improve the life circumstances of the people who use those spaces; it only deprives them of a space to exist. Cities have been and continue to be hard at work </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to provide more resources for these communities, but rather to transform socioeconomic barriers into physical ones. One might be tempted to dismiss the removal of the bench and other aspects of defensive architecture, as it is easy to dismiss things that don’t affect ourselves personally. Still, this phenomenon reflects the disturbing notion that people don’t want to help other people. People don’t care if others have nowhere else to gather, sit, sleep or even use the bathroom. They just don’t want to see them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the removal of the Flinstone bench is indicative of larger negative trends, this does not discount the good that has been done in recent years in the Santa Barbara and Isla Vista communities. For example, cities such as Santa Barbara are alloting increased funds to aid the houseless population, although problems still arise with </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/01/good-news-and-bad-for-santa-barbara-citys-homeless-people/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how this money is being allocated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Oftentimes, money is spent “dealing with” houselessness, instead of solving issues or helping houseless people. As</span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/01/good-news-and-bad-for-santa-barbara-citys-homeless-people/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, $5 million are spent annually addressing the ‘practical’ repercussions of houselessness, as opposed to the $1 million used to actually remedy the issue itself. This proportion should be flipped: Rather than spending vast amounts of money on after effects such as cleanup, camp sweep-outs and service calls, these resources and time should be aimed at more reparative efforts, like </span><a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/la-homelessness-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increasing available housing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/la-homelessness-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support programs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who gets to take up public space and why?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the city of Santa Barbara continuously prioritizes the ‘established’ community more than that of the houseless, Isla Vista has made hopeful steps in a more productive and more compassionate direction. A positive local development occurred in 2014 with the construction of  Isla Vista houseless shelter, t</span><a href=\"https://localwiki.org/islavista/Houseless_in_IV\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he Pescadero Lofts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since opening, the lofts have remained at full capacity, and the number of people living on the streets of I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decreased 44%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the previous year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although hostile urban design is something I noticed in the past, it took seeing the Flinstone bench demolished and carried off for me to sit down and write this article. I hope those who are, like me, privileged enough to ignore these realities take a step back and notice the ways the public landscape influences real lives. I urge cities to take the more compassionate, humane approach and to stop prioritizing the needs of the city over the needs of the person. As the general public we may not have control over the way our cities are planned, covered and designed. At the same time, we can refute with our own voices the insidious tactics of defensive architecture, increased policing or even the simple removal of a bench and demand that public spaces remain public. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Dager wants cities to do better.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Earmuffs, ski masks, gloves and long johns did more than just keep me warm: they signified the changing of the seasons, something that just doesn’t happen in California. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91750\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91750\" data-attachment-id=\"91750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-11/esat-coasters-guide-california-winter/xmas-in-ca/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Xmas-in-Ca-e1576061449231.png?fit=650%2C533&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Xmas in Ca\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Xmas-in-Ca-e1576061449231.png?fit=250%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Xmas-in-Ca-e1576061449231.png?fit=888%2C728&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Xmas-in-Ca-e1576061449231.png?resize=480%2C393\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"393\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-91750\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can burn my Bath &amp; Body Works Vanilla Bean Noel candle all I want, but even the most festive scents can’t replace the true coziness of frigid temperatures and crackling fireplaces.

So for anyone else who has known the joys of an East Coast winter and is feeling a bit apprehensive about the prospect of a California holiday, here’s a quick guide to help you cope:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While snow is what really makes winter beautiful, it can also be the stuff of nightmares. First of all, shoveling is the absolute worst. It’s genuinely hard work, and sometimes you might find yourself shoveling in the dark and racing against the clock to clear the driveway before the snow freezes. There’s also the dreaded slush, when the snow turns various shades of brown or grey. Even the coveted snow day can turn against you. For instance, one year, for my sixth birthday, there was so much snow that no one could come to my party. So when I find myself biking to class in 75 degree weather in the middle of November, I try to remind myself that not getting to wear a scarf is a small price to pay for not having to deal with these horrors.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, baking is an essential part of winter. When the temperatures outside approached freezing and my parents refused to turn up the thermostat, baking helped warm me up. These days, even if I don’t need to bake to stay warm, a fresh batch of cookies, brownies or apple crisp takes me back to those winter days of yore. If you need a little holiday cheer, throw a cookie decorating party or a gingerbread house-making competition!\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My least favorite part of winter is how early the sun sets. Here in California, we’re still dealing with short days but at least we get sun until close to 5:30 pm. Where I grew up in Massachusetts, the sun sets as early as 4 pm during this time of year. It might not seem like much, but that extra hour certainly makes a difference, and if there’s one thing I can be thankful for this Thanksgiving, it’s that I have one more hour of sunshine every day.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the month of December, keep an eye out for fun and festive events happening nearby. For example, in Santa Barbara, there is an annual </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/waterfront/events/light_parade.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parade of Lights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There will be up to 30 boats this year decorated to the theme of “Deep Space Holidays,” sailing the Santa Barbara coastline. Apparently there will even be 10 tons of snow! There is also the </span><a href=\"https://santabarbaraca.com/events/solvang-julefest/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solvang Julefest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which takes place throughout the entire month of December. There are many other holiday events happening in the area, so if finals week is getting you down, check out some local events for a festive pick-me-up.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to remember during the winter holidays is that it’s about spending time with the ones you love </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whether that means family, friends or the neighbor’s dog. It doesn’t matter whether there’s snow on the ground or what the thermostat says, as long as it’s spent with the people we love. Since moving to California when I was 14, I have been lucky enough to only spend one winter break here. Though I still prefer heading east for the holidays, even though it wasn’t the Christmas I was used to, it was still a fun and happy time because I spent it with family.    </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there you have it: these are some of the things that have helped me through the season until I get to return to my icy home for winter break. Of course, there is nothing wrong with California winters (most probably prefer it); I just can’t seem to get used to the palm trees and snow-less landscapes come November. But wherever you are this holiday season, I hope it delivers on the promise of being the most wonderful time of the year. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes everyone a frosty winter and a happy holidays.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

biohazard. Common sense? Definitely. Two eyes and a brain? Probably. Heck, you could even use your sense of smell. So I can’t help but wonder just how my four housemates — who share between them eight eyes, four big brains, a couple of noses and early pass times as honors students — so consistently attempt to poison themselves! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would think it’s obvious that when your fish has been defrosting in the sun for the last 11 hours, it’s become less salmon and more salmonella. It’s common knowledge that you should slow roast your chicken breast for more than five whole minutes or that ground beef that’s been in the fridge for the last week and a half is ground zero for an E. coli outbreak. Before I moved in last week, I never thought my life would be endangered by a half-cooked dead animal. Unfortunately, my housemates perfectly demonstrate the distinction between having a brain and using it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One evening, I come home tired, cold and hungry and find that my roommate has been cooking, and he’s saved some for me!</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s a chicken leg and rice,” he says. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why thank you,” I respond: And, in a moment of weakness, I almost take a bite — before I remember that this is the same chicken I saw several centuries ago festering away on the countertop, sitting in its own private lake of bloody water. Now, if my housemates want to contract salmonella on a daily basis they’re more than welcome to do so. But when they make such a vile and heinous attempt on my life by feeding me undercooked and over-defrosted chicken, things have gone one bloody hunk of meat too far. After this traumatic incident I seriously wondered why no one in the house wanted my sound advice on how not to intentionally ingest health-endangering compounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided the best course of action would be to methodically and scientifically determine what made my housemates the brilliant idiots they are. After a week of observations, several assorted nonviolent confrontations, a few major squabbles and the odd barely averted tragedy or two, I came to the conclusion that the only things any of my housemates really have in common is that they are Asian men. Now, being the brilliant scientist that I am, I deduced that since all five of us are Asian and male — and all of us are idiots — being Asian and male must be contributing to this idiocy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes sense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See, the main problem for us Asians in admitting error is that, traditionally, a single mistake is enough to disgrace your family for the next eon or two. The contrary is also true: Every Asian family has at least one deity-ancestor who lived when dinosaurs were the primary mode of transportation. Despite having lived so long ago, we know today as a scientific certainty that this particular ancestor was half-dragon, half-tiger and held off 346 invading Huns on his own — not to mention that he was the chief counselor of the Chinese emperor and commander of the imperial fleet and army at the same time. As such, any ancestor of lesser import is quickly forgotten by the annals of time, ostensibly because no one wants to hear the epic saga of Uncle Li who moved to America against his family’s wishes, caused irreparable harm to the family name and opened a chow mein stand in Brooklyn. In the same vein, no Asian wants to be forever remembered as that one disgrace to the family by getting straight A’s and a Ph.D. but not even being able to cook. Admission of error — never. Error in itself is a disgrace to the family name. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a week of observations, several assorted nonviolent confrontations, a few major squabbles and the odd barely averted tragedy or two, I came to the conclusion that the only things any of my housemates really have in common is that they are Asian men.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking for help has more practical repercussions as well: The problem with asking a family member for help in an Asian circle is that, at most, within the next three to five business days, everyone you have ever met in your life, along with all their friends, coworkers and deceased aunt’s stepfather’s rottweilers, will know all about how Ling Ling tried to make miso soup in a frying pan. You will never redeem yourself and you will never catch a break. Every time someone so much as takes out a frying pan, aunt whatever-her-name-was will take it as a mandate to recount the events of Ling Ling’s frying pan miso soup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is even more true for Asian males. As the head of the traditional Asian household, us males are expected to be entirely correct all the time. Facts to the contrary? Invented by insubordinate and disrespectful outcasts who have no respect for true family. Good advice? It’s no good if I don’t agree with it. Three minutes too short to grill a side of pork? Nonsense! I’ll eat it myself just to prove how safe it is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One superb example can be seen on bike paths where one particularly dashing and adventuresome international student will courageously lead the way onto the path by foot, presumably demonstrating to others in his posse how healthful and efficient such a practice can be. Then, upon his narrowly avoiding permanent brain damage by bike, it takes a good 15 minutes of shouting to dislodge our explorer from his notion that bike paths were intended to be traversed on foot. Much annoyance could be prevented through the use of eyes and common sense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Asian male myself, I have to admit that I share some of these tendencies. I can’t remember a single time growing up that I was ever wrong or mistaken. No, not the time I was five and thought that yellowish stuff in a brown bottle was apple juice. No, not after I got roaring drunk on it and replaced all the holes in Mr. Potato Head with crayons. Especially not after my parents whooped my ass for drinking beer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s get real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, your parents will not disown you because you couldn’t self-study Chemistry 1A. No, your teachers won’t roast you for coming in during office hours. Yes, there may be slight discomfort upon admitting you need help in chemistry, or that you’ve never cooked chicken, or your obituary nearly listed death by cyclist. But take it from someone who’s had food poisoning — that slight discomfort is still way better than the alternative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to all the guys out there: You have two heads, the big one and the small one. The small one isn’t nearly as big as you think it is, so do yourself a favor and use the big one instead. Don’t be afraid to admit you’re wrong because one head of the household is enough. Cram five heads into one tight apartment in Isla Vista and you have a literal sausage fest. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sam Suh recommends that, in the event of a sausage fest, fry them for at least six to eight minutes.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf97bc258d988925a37f572ab1cf95?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf97bc258d988925a37f572ab1cf95?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/samsuh/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Suh</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Suh is an opinion staff writer.
