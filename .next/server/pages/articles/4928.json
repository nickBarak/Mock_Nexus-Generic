Junior utility Mary Brooks saw multiple breakaways throughout the game which led to her hat trick.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter Brooks drew a penalty after being fouled by senior utility Taylor Shore. The ensuing penalty was scored for the first goal of the contest.</p>\n<p>UCI added another goal with 35 seconds remaining in the quarter to make it 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled offensively in the first quarter as they were forced to take many long shots as the shot clock was winding down.</p>\n<p>After the Anteaters scored two more goals in the second quarter, the Gauchos finally got on the board.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Abbey Grosse received the long ball after breaking away from the defense. She then drew a penalty which she rifled into the back of the net with a skip shot.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos conceded another goal before end of the half resulting in a 5-1 score at break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the third quarter with a goal from senior defender Sophie Trabucco.</p>\n<p>At this point the Gauchos were very much in the game only down by three goals, however, this is when the Anteaters turned it on.</p>\n<p>UCI scored four unanswered goals in the third quarter which extended the Anteaters lead to 9-2 with 1:30 left in the quarter. The deficit was too much to overcome, especially considering the tremendous pressure that UCI was implemented with their defense.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos cut into the lead with back to back goals from freshman utility Sarah Snyder and Grosse who had a team high two goals in this game.</p>\n<p>After Irvine scored their last goal, senior utility Jenna Solberg threw in a beautiful lob shot with just 4 ticks remaining in the game. The final score was 10-5 in favor of UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>With only a few games left before the Big West Tournament, UCSB are looking to turn it around and finish the season off strong by defending their Big West Tournament title.</p>\n<p>“Now that we have two regular season games left, I think it’s important that we come out with nothing to lose no matter who we play for the rest of the time,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have its senior night next Saturday, April 15 in its final home game of the season against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/","id":4928,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4927,4926,4925],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini","biography":"Not available","articles":[1887,4900,4904,4905,4906,4907,4920,4921,4923,4924,4925,4926,4927,4928,4929,4930,4931,4932,4933,4934,5557],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Wagner, Fall to Arizona State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its first road trip of the season, the UCSB women's water polo split its pair of matchup at the ASU Invitational.

The Gauchos matched their season high for goals in a quarter with six as they outscored the Seahawks 6-3 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Over a minute into the second quarter, senior utility Taylor Shore threw in her first goal of the day to bring the Gauchos within one. Watson responded by netting her hat trick to bring the lead back to two goals for Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then went on a 3-0 scoring run to take their first lead of the afternoon at 5-4. Redshirt freshman attacker Shannon Moran began the scoring run followed by goals from Shore and freshman utility Sarah Snyder who continued her tremendous goal scoring run.</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the game with four goals which adds to her team high total of 15 goals on the season. The freshman also contributed with two assists this game and is the only gaucho to score in every game up to this point.</p>\n<p>Wagner added two more goals to their total as they took the lead once again, but UCSB returned the favor with two goals scored by Snyder and freshman attacker Natalie Selin ending the half on top 7-6.</p>\n<p>“Wagner came out battling and I give them a lot of credit,” UCSB Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They never backed down the whole game.”</p>\n<p>It took over half of the third quarter to get the first goal of the half. After that Seahawks equalizer, the Gauchos finished the quarter off with two goals in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended their unanswered goal scoring streak to four when they scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter. At this point the Gauchos had a cushioned 11-7 advantage with just 5:35 to go.</p>\n<p>After conceding three straight goals, including two over the final 1:29, the Gauchos held on for what turned out to be a nail-biting victory in the end.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a little out of control on our defensive end and even offensively just taking care of the ball,” Kay said. “We found a way to win, we found a way to hold on.”</p>\n<p>Aside from some mistakes in this game, the defense was solid yet again just like it has been all year for the Gauchos. They have only allowed over eight goals in two games this season. If you exclude the blowout loss to USC, the Gauchos have only conceded about 6.7 goal per game.</p>\n<p>The freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who had nine saves versus Wagner, has been a big part of the defensive success.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder holds down the cage for us and she has a high game IQ,” Kay said. “She has not only a physical presence but also a presence vocally in the cage and I think that makes a big difference for us.”</p>\n<p>Next up were the hosts Arizona State who came into the meeting with a 2-0 record having won their first two games of the Invitational.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils began the scoring at the 5:02 mark in the first quarter. In the ensuing possession, Shore assisted Selin for her second goal of the weekend to even the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the second period, freshman utility Kate Coski chalked up her fourth score of the season. At 2-1 this turned out to be the first and only lead for the Gauchos in this one.</p>\n<p>The hosts levelled 15 seconds later and then took the lead with under two minutes remaining in the half.</p>\n<p>As the half was winding down, Trabucco equalized with her first of two goals in the game. The half came to an end all even at 3-3 in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\n<p>“I was happy about the way that we competed right from the start,” Kay said. “Anytime you you’re playing a team 1-1 in the first quarter and then 3-3 at half that says that you’re playing solid defense and both teams are battling.”</p>\n<p>ASU turned it on the third quarter with four goals while not conceding any at the other end of the pool. UCSB was even with Arizona State in every quarter except the third which ended up costing them the game.</p>\n<p>“We made some poor choices offensively that led to goals for them that set up their offense,” Kay said. “We’re young and the season is early so it’s important at this point that we learn from that third quarter. I think it’s important when things get a little out of our control that we learn to be resilient.”</p>\n<p>The final score was 8-4 as ASU finished off their undefeated weekend. Santa Barbara ended the invitational splitting their two games in Tempe.</p>\n<p>Kay was very pleased with what this young team was able to do on their first road trip against a couple of strong sides. However, with the youth comes some natural obstacles to get around.</p>\n<p>“We need to focus on the details,” Kay said. “We need to realize that it’s the little things that make big things happen.”</p>\n<p>After a short break, UCSB will continue their season at the Triton Invitational in San Diego on February 11<sup>th</sup>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75374\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75374\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/gauchos-outlast-wagner-fall-to-arizona-state/","id":4925,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4924,4923,4922],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Prepared for Triton Invitational After Week of Rest","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winless through one match on the road thus far, the UCSB women's water polo team will look to change its away game status this weekend at the Triton Invitational.

Entering the Triton Invitational with a 5-3 overall record this season so far, UCSB has only lost to teams that are ranked above them in the national rankings: No. 7 Michigan, No. 2 USC and No. 5 ASU.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, CSUN, after beginning the season 1-6, has strung together three wins in a row as they look to stay in good form. Since 2011, the Matadors have only beaten the Gauchos three times in 12 matchups.</p>\n<p>“They return all of their starters from last year, so they’re a little bit older of a team,” Kay said. “It’s important that we come out and focus on the defensive end to start, and everything from there will come.”</p>\n<p>The stout defense of UCSB will have to deal with CSUN junior attacker Katelyn Fairchild who has scored a team-high 23 goals this season in just 10 games. This is a Gaucho defense that held the Matadors to only four goals in both matchups last season. It will be a clash of youth and experience on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Following their matchup versus CSUN, UCSB will play in a rematch against either the No. 7 Wolverines or No. 23 Marist, who it faced during the Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was defeated by Michigan that weekend 7-4, so there is an opportunity to get even after being handed its first loss of the season by the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>“Excited about the possibility of facing either of those teams again,” Kay said. “We played [Michigan] tough the first time around.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the UCSB roster has been a work in progress this year. However, against great competition, they have been able to put together impressive results.</p>\n<p>“Every game that we play we’re learning something new about ourselves as a team,” Kay said. “The freshmen are getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>With all the freshmen on the team, the more experienced players have an expanded role in guiding the newcomers. Kay recently had an important conversation with seniors Sophie Trabucco and Jenna Solberg about this season and about their important roles.</p>\n<p>“Both [Trabucco and Solberg] have a big defensive presence for our team; they’re both very competitive and tough,” Kay said. “You can’t do it without players like that. It was really special to be able to share publicly how important that sort of player is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to get back in the pool for some more competitive action as they look to continue to improve their chemistry.</p>\n<p>“This weekend, the main objective is to learn how to play together a little bit more and start putting the pieces together,” Kay said. “It’ll be fun once we get a few more games under our belts and things will start clicking.”</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara finished in eighth place at the Triton Invitational out of 16 teams. This confident bunch is ready to improve upon that result in this year’s event with the help of the young, great freshmen and the reliable seniors.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Cal State Northridge Saturday at 12:30 p.m. in their first match at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/","id":4926,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4925,4924,4923],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Water Polo Nearly Completes Sweep at Triton Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-8-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was a successful showing for the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team in its first road trip of the season.

Santa Barbara never looked back as it kept the lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Later in the first quarter freshman attacker Natalie Selin doubled the lead for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With over a minute left in the first quarter, the Matadors scored their first goal of the game to make it 2-1 heading into the second quarter of action.</p>\n<p>Two and a half minutes into the second quarter, senior attacker Brenna Thomas brought the lead back to two goals after the Gauchos took advantage of a Matador exclusion.</p>\n<p>Just before the half with only 21 seconds remaining, senior utility Taylor Shore scored her first of four goals in the game. The score was 4-2 at halftime in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to control the game as they outscored CSUN 7-4 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Snyder opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the third quarter followed by goals from Shore and Thomas.</p>\n<p>At the 5:33 mark in the fourth quarter the Matadors fought back to make it 7-5. From that point on, UCSB cemented the victory by going on a 4-1 run to close the game.</p>\n<p>In that run, Shore added two more goals to her total to give her four on the game, Snyder threw in another for her hat trick and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg also scored.</p>\n<p>That win meant UCSB would automatically finish inside the top eight for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The next opponent was No. 6 Michigan, who they faced at the Winter Invitational earlier in the season in a tough defensive battle. The Gauchos were looking for revenge in this one, as they fell 7-4 last time out against the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>The first quarter was one to forget for Santa Barbara as they uncharacteristically found themselves down 4-0.</p>\n<p>“It was too big of a hole that we dug ourselves under,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “In a game like that where the rest of the game each team is only scoring one goal per quarter, you can’t go down by four.”</p>\n<p>Selin managed to slip a goal in right before the halftime buzzer with 23 seconds remaining to give UCSB a 5-1 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Excluding the poor first quarter, the Gauchos were only outscored 3-2 through the final three quarters of the game. With a 7-2 defeat to the Wolverines, UCSB was looking ahead to their next opponent in San Diego State.</p>\n<p>San Diego State was coming off a blowout loss to USC, so they too were looking to bounce back. The winner of this matchup reserved a spot in the fifth-place game later that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 in the middle of the first quarter, Thomas of UCSB scored her third goal of the weekend to begin the scoring for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser and senior utility Jenna Solberg scored, resulting in a close 3-2 advantage at halftime over SDSU.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter the Gauchos poured in three unanswered goals from sophomore utility Kate Pipkin, Kreiser and redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader to give them a 6-3 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Just 20 seconds into the fourth quarter, Kreiser finished off her hat trick to extend the lead. The final period included goals from Pipkin on a penalty and Snyder, giving UCSB the victory 9-6.</p>\n<p>Several hours later, Santa Barbara faced the Aggies of UC Davis in the fifth-place game at the Triton Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB fell behind 2-0 in the first quarter with 2:56 remaining. 30 seconds later, Shore got the Gauchos on the board with her first of three goals in the game.</p>\n<p>UC Davis responded with a goal of their own and closed the half with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos returned the favor in the second frame, battling back to even the score with goals from Pipkin, Shore and freshman utility Abbey Grosse. It was anyone’s game with the score at 4-4 heading into the halftime break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came away from the third quarter with a 6-5 lead as Kreiser and senior defender Sophie Trabucco lifted the Gauchos ahead of the Aggies.</p>\n<p>Shore struck early in the fourth period followed by Kreiser’s goal three minutes later, which increased the count to 8-5 with 4:12 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>At the 1:12 mark, the Aggies began to claw back, reducing the deficit to two goals. With 55 seconds left, UC Davis scored again as the comeback looked more and more possible.</p>\n<p>However, it was not enough. UCSB held on the take fifth place at the Triton Invitational. This result was another step in the right direction for this young Gaucho squad.</p>\n<p>“Things are starting to fall into place,” Kay said. “There were a few moments throughout the weekend that the games could’ve gone either way, and we held on and came out with the win.”</p>\n<p>The defense of UCSB showed up yet again throughout this tournament, holding opponents to just 6.5 goals per game in their three wins and one loss.</p>\n<p>“Before every game … our focus is to come out and defense first,” said Kay. “I think the team really bought into that.”</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder had 42 saves for the tournament, including 27 on Sunday as she continues to anchor the defense for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder is doing a great job in the cage for us,” Kay said. “She’s a freshman and she’s really stepped into that role right away, and I’m proud of where she’s at.”</p>\n<p>As things start clicking as the Gauchos get closer to Big West conference play, every game seems like a positive growing experience for this young team.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the weekend with every game, because we are a young team, was to learn to play with each other a little bit more,” Kay said. “I think that definitely showed throughout the weekend. We’re a different team leaving after the fourth game than before we arrived.”</p>\n<p>After getting this upcoming weekend off, UCSB will head down to Irvine to participate in the UC Irvine Invitational beginning on Feb. 24.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/","id":4927,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4926,4925,4924],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
