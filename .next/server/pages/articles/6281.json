","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the historic emergence of the #MeToo movement in 2017 came an unforeseeable consequence: the blowing up of “canceled culture.” Canceled culture as a concept has been around since the start of time, but in the last year has been taken to a whole new level. In the last year, we’ve seen celebrities accused of sexual assault be “canceled” and all their work invalidated and boycotted. But it doesn’t stop there: celebrities that make just about any mistake fall into the same category of “canceled” as these accused celebrities. Although the boycott is sometimes completely justified, people seem to often take it too far or too seriously, not realizing that there is a difference between an artist and their art.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86440\" style=\"width: 296px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86440\" data-attachment-id=\"86440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/separating-artists-from-their-art-when-are-they-canceled/art-v-artist/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,1011\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"art v artist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?fit=750%2C1011&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist-185x250.jpg?resize=286%2C386\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow me to drop a mind-blowing fact real quick: celebrities are human too.

Twitter blew up in outrage at these rediscovered tweets, and Hart was #canceled as quickly as he was appointed to host. His past tweets caused so much controversy that Hart</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinHart4real/status/1070906075812118529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1070906075812118529&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fkevin-hart-oscars-withdrawal%2F\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">withdrew</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from hosting the award show.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as Hart explained in his</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXtlGdPenbc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interview with Ellen DeGeneres</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he had already apologized for these old tweets and had been trying to learn from his mistakes and move forward with his life. Twitter didn’t take a second to breathe and do background research before exploding on Hart for his mistakes. This is where the debate of whether or not art should be viewed as separate from the artist comes in: should Kevin Hart be allowed to perform given his problematic past?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the internet fad of canceling celebrities at the snap of a finger, it was much easier for consumers to draw a line between an artist and their art. In modern society, however, that line is blurred and sometimes nonexistent. Picasso was misogynistic, yet his art is still considered some of the best in the world. William Golding was an attempted rapist, but his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lord of the Flies </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is still taught in high schools across the nation. J.D. Salinger was a pedophile, yet he is considered one of the greatest American authors of all time, and his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Catcher in the Rye </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the most widely-read novels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, consumers of entertainment have decided to take more responsibility for holding celebrities accountable for their actions, but it has gotten to the point where celebrities can’t take a single step out of place without risking everything. I’m in no way condoning the previously mentioned artists’ behavior; I’m just stating that these artists are different from their art and their work, and that their personalities should be considered separately. Supporting an artist’s work is not equivalent to supporting their actions, to a certain extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This line gets a little hazy with artists who haven’t just made small mistakes. On one end of the spectrum of #canceled celebrities are celebrities like Kevin Hart and on the other end are celebrities like Tekashi 6ix9ine, R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. For the latter artists mentioned, it becomes harder to support their work without feeling like you’re condoning their actions. Although there is an extreme difference between Kevin Hart’s eight-year-old homophobic tweets and Bill Cosby’s </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple sexual assault charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both have fallen victim to canceled culture. Making the separation between an artist and their art was definitely easier before the Internet, and although I believe it’s still important, it becomes more difficult with celebrities on the extreme end of the spectrum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a wide range of actions that can make a celebrity fall victim to the hashtag, and what irks me is that no matter where you fall on this spectrum, you get sentenced to #canceled for life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a good middle ground that society can take on this issue is to be more accepting and lenient towards work from artists who have made active efforts to learn from their mistakes and move forward. Let me be clear: this doesn’t apply to the Bill Cosbys or R. Kellys of the world, but it does apply to the Kevin Harts. Kevin Hart has made a public and conscious effort to right his wrongs and move on with his life, and we should not judge his comedy in light of his personal mistakes. We’re putting too much pressure on ourselves as consumers to evaluate what should and shouldn’t be appreciated due to the actions of their creators. Instead, we should appreciate art for what it is, rather than blaming ourselves for “supporting” an artist’s slightly problematic past.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alysha

number of Isla Vista’s local bands over the last couple years, I’ve found it’s difficult to attach myself to their music, as members frequently graduate and leave their bandmates behind. However, Careless Cub just released their first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, thus solidifying their mark on the I.V. music scene in a succinct eight-song declaration of the trio’s talents. The three-piece includes Grant Chesin, a fourth-year English major on lead vocals and guitar, Andrew Becker, a fourth-year chemical engineering major on drums and backup vocals and, finally, Ray Muhlenkamp, a third-year computer science and German double major on bass (who also used to play in The Mallards!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-described as “singer-songwriter surf rock,” Careless Cub and their new album have the distinct Isla Vista sound of melodic tunes mixed in with faster, upbeat rhythms and lyrics expressing contemplation of life, young love and growing up. To create this sound, the band describes having strong musical influences from Father John Misty, The Growlers, Courtney Barnett and The Eagles. However, the band acknowledges their changing sound as they try to figure out which genre they belong to through different styles of music. “I think it’s hard to say we’re a certain genre. It’s not like an egotistical thing; it’s more just like, here we’ll play a punk song, there an alt-rock song, a vibey surf rock song,” Chesin says, “We’re just finding our way through the music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stands out not merely for its musical elements but also for the production and sound quality of the tracks. In an interview with the band, I inquired about the recording process and, to my surprise, another I.V. musician was the one to thank for the polished debut. “Alec Luttrell from Odd Army was the guy who mixed, tracked and mastered everything, and the reason it sounds so high-quality is completely because of him. He did an amazing job,” Muhlenkamp said. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most of the tracks have a mellow, house party vibe, “Hemingway Lemonade,” “Skipping Town” and “As a Kid” are the ones to look out for. In my brief talk with Careless Cub, they explained how “Hemingway Lemonade” has definitely been a fan favorite since the album’s release on Feb. 1 — and it’s clear as to why. Classic alt-rock guitar strumming starts the song, calling for listeners far and wide to join Careless Cub on their journey through college in the fun and daring environment that is Isla Vista. For the most part, “Hemingway Lemonade” is a relaxed, chill song that anyone with an ounce of rhythm in their bodies can sway and bob their heads to. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86090\" style=\"width: 1009px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2026532933\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86089\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86090\" data-attachment-id=\"86090\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/a-word-with-careless-club-on-flophouse-palace/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=999%2C1005&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,1005\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?fit=888%2C893&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86090\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=888%2C893\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=768%2C773&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51526296_239482983660084_5698131135918243840_n.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Careless Cub</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Skipping Town” has a personal tone, as the first lyrics literally begin with advice from singer Chesin’s supposed therapist. This song then describes the kind of romantic insecurity that naturally comes with being in love at this young age and lays out a plan for the protagonist to skip town and start over in an emotional, alt-rock college ballad. “I’ll come up with a melody and lyrics and then I’ll play it to them [Becker and Muhlenkamp] and they’ll go ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ and then they start building their parts,” Chesin described the songwriting process. “I’d say especially ‘Family Tree’ and ‘Yikes a Daisies’ have almost become entirely their songs with how much they added.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chesin cited “Monterey Bay” and “I Can’t Believe You Fell in Love with Me” as his favorite songs, while Becker and Muhlenkamp both agreed on “Never Coming Home,” which they cheekily described as the one “that has the least amount of listens right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to asking about where the songwriting came from and what their favorite songs were, I had to know — what does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flophouse Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually mean? Well, according to front man Chesin: “The name ‘Flophouse Palace’ is from the book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannery Row</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I thought it’s such a funny oxymoron.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Flophouse’ is defined as essentially people who stay there for a couple days and trash it, and that’s kind of Isla Vista,” he explained. “It’s like sometimes you feel ‘Oh my god, I’m in a dream land,’ to ‘This is the worst place.’ Also, I live at this place called the Palace, which isn’t a real palace, but it’s just kind of a play on that.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want more of Careless Cub?

present I’ve ever gotten: a silver Casio personal CD player, complete with a set of earphones and anti-shock technology. As a child of the early 2000s, this was wonderful – iPods hadn’t hit the scene yet and it was as close as I could get at the time. This also meant that I had access to my parents’ massive CD collection, taking random mixes from my dad’s car, or borrowing the new music that my mom had just bought from Best Buy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent quality time with the music that piqued my interest most, developing my personal tastes quite early on.

After school, friends would peek over at the small screen of my most prized possession and wonder, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is she listening to?”</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black girls aren’t supposed to like guitars. Black girls aren’t supposed to like music that’s for white people. Black girls don’t listen to bands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After these realizations, music became even more personal to me. Of course, I sang along to Top 40 hits by Lady Gaga and Beyonce in the mall with my friends, and fell in love with Drake as he rose up the pop-hop ranks on the radio. But the songs on my iPod – the songs for old people, the songs for white people –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I kept those mostly to myself. I reveled in the time I got to spend watching music videos on my shared home laptop and putting on my earphones while nestled in the backseat during long drives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High school came around, and I was equipped with my own computer and a smartphone, also known as the greatest tools for music discovery ever invented. I searched, I dug for more and I downloaded an embarrassing amount of illegal songs from websites that were likely on the FBI’s radar. Mixed CDs with handwritten tracklists were the best gifts I knew how to give, and were reserved for the people I cared about most. I leaned into finding music that I loved –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely as a means to somehow find myself too. It became a hobby and the thing that made me happiest at the end of another day as a teenage girl. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86527\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1777453890\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86525\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86527\" data-attachment-id=\"86527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/black-girls-like-guitars-too/unnamed-1-27/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=595%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"595,490\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=250%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?fit=595%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86527 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4-250x206.jpg?resize=250%2C206\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?resize=250%2C206&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-1-4.jpg?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first favorite bands were Coldplay, Radiohead and Nirvana. All three of these bands are basic fare to people well-versed in pop culture, but can be life-changing to a young person. I found more bands, posted links to music videos on Tumblr and Facebook and talked about my favorite new songs with anyone who would listen. Sometimes, I was called white-washed, a try-hard and a number of other stupid things I thankfully can’t remember anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this didn’t happen often;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t bullied for my music taste. I am not claiming to be the victim of some form of musical racism. But I constantly felt that I was trying to be figured out. The music taste I had developed, coupled with the way I spoke and the types of boys I had crushes on, was cause for confusion. Eventually, I too became confused by myself and wondered why, to most people, my identity didn’t match my tastes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second half of my high school years, I found Vampire Weekend, Tame Impala and Mac DeMarco –</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a group which I now affectionately refer to as Baby’s First Indie Bands. By this time, I was fully settled into liking “white” music, or whatever else made me stop and listen. If nothing else, I knew what I wanted to hear, which was very important in me becoming fully, outwardly myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the deep-dive into music history during my early college years came an important realization: black people had an instrumental role in the creation of rock and roll. Some of music’s most important figures were black – and had white listeners. Chuck Berry was one of </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/paul-mccartney-on-chuck-berry-he-was-a-magician-111984/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Beatles’</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> primary inspirations and </span><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UaWJ8Kd2pG4C&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elton John</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be considered Little Richard’s closest counterpart. This was powerful knowledge: proof that my love for music with guitars is perhaps natural. Black girls like guitars, and people that look like us play them too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I embraced my love of music that contrasted with who I was supposed to be in the minds of others and moved forward. Now, house shows in Isla Vista are one of the places I feel most comfortable. Most importantly, I’ve made writing about music of all kinds my focus. Music belongs to everyone, not only in parts deemed to be fit for certain groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever makes me feel, whatever I choose to be for me, can be mine. If you limit yourself in consuming any sort of creative expression, based on preconceived notions of who it is created for, it is a blatant disservice to the art and to yourself. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

The idea of the public being interested in the products and activities of celebs is nothing new, but YouTube is a media outlet that is banking on this concept through vlogs. Some viewers who watch these videos may try to copy the beauty regimes of their favorite celebrities, but this could max out their credit card and/or distract them from the specific beauty and skin routine that’s best for them. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think there is anything wrong with watching these videos. YouTube is a great social media platform, especially when you’re a busy college student and don’t have enough time to watch a whole episode of TV. However, I don’t think it’s good if it becomes an obsession to imitate a celebrity or influencer’s lifestyle. When viewers copy influencer’s habits, it puts a lot of pressure on the individual. For example, Victoria’s Secret models have a lot of videos sharing their diet and exercises leading up to the annual fashion show, but these kinds of regiments can be unhealthy if the average person overdoes it in terms of exercising and dieting. Trying to be or look like someone else can enforce unhealthy expectations and a desire for unrealistic beauty goals. I know there are times when I have overworked my body, and it’s always good to take a step back and realize that I should be eating and working out to feel good instead of obsessing about looking a certain way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily routine videos just aren’t that interesting after a while. There are different channels I follow based on YouTubers that I think are funny or topics that I am fascinated by. But, there are only so many morning or nighttime routine videos I can watch. All of us have different routines, and seeing other people get ready in the morning just is not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exciting.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that it’s important to form healthy habits and regimens, and it’s always fun to get tips from others that you admire, but that doesn’t mean you have to copy everything they do. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is no shame in watching or liking these daily routine videos. Although, I do think it’s good to ask yourself why you watch them. Do you want to follow someone else’s lifestyle? I believe that it’s important to form healthy habits and regimens, and it’s always fun to get tips from others that you admire, but that doesn’t mean you have to copy everything they do. Trying Alexis Ren’s salad showed me that I am better off creating my own meal plan. There’s no harm in trying new foods and not liking them, as I did, but I realized that I’m happier preparing meals that I’ve grown up eating. I don’t need to copy anyone else’s diet, and I think it’s better to discover what you’re interested in on your own. Would you rather live someone else’s life or create your own?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this day and age, social media has created an environment of constantly comparing yourself to others or trying to follow trends. Why not just take a step back and find what makes you happy without basing it on other people’s choices? On social media, influencers show the kind of life that they choose to share with the world, and it’s important to realize that this lens might not be authentic or give the whole picture. I’d rather spend my early 20s discovering who I am as an individual rather than following the habits of celebrities and influencers who lead seemingly perfect lives. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala wants YouTube users to make healthy choices that fit their individual needs.</span></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/is-your-daily-routine-someone-elses/","id":6280,"author":{"id":681,"name":"Morgan Wiitala"},"related":[6279,6278,6277],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
