As long as we all stay positive and stay on the same page, I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>One of two teams still winless in conference, the Gauchos need to make a run quickly in the ultra-competitive Big West this year.</p>\n<p>The other team still chasing its first conference victory is Riverside. The Highlanders are also extremely hungry for a victory having lost 10 consecutive games. They enter the Thunderdome with a 4-13 overall and a 0-4 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>“We’re both backed in the corner as far as our record and Big West standings,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “There’s no panic, but there is a sense of urgency. We just need to take care of business at home the next two games, and we’ll be at the same record we started out at this point last year. We know what to do. It’s just a matter of buckling down and getting it done.”</p>\n<p>One fatal flaw for UCSB in Big West contests so far has been falling behind by large margins and needing to play catch up late in the game.</p>\n<p>“There’s no reason for us to dig ourselves holes like that,” Mitchell said. “This team is a little uncomfortable with who to go to and through when we need a basket, so everyone puts themselves on an island and tries to do it on their own. You can never do that. It takes five players on the court, so they need to learn to trust each other.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ offense is plenty capable of scoring, ranking first in the Big West in field-goal percentage the majority of the year, Santa Barbara knows that defense is what wins it games and that they must return to their defensive prowess from previous years. Right now, UCSB ranks fifth in scoring defense, giving up 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Opening up conference, we knew we had to write it across our chest as being a defensive team first,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “That will lead to offense and transition baskets, but it has to start with defense. We know that.”</p>\n<p>Commanding the attention of any defense in the conference is sophomore guard Brittany Crain. Crain leads the Hinglanders in virtually every category, but also tops the Big West in scoring with 19.7 points per game, including 22.0 points during conference play. She also ranks first in conference in steals with 2.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to stick to fundamental defense, just really bother her,” Nesbit said. “You try to make her job difficult and contest her shots and stay in front of her.”</p>\n<p>However, the Highlanders do feature four players averaging double-figures. One player that the Gauchos will keep an eye on is senior center Natasha Hadley. The only senior on the squad, Hadley has given Santa Barbara trouble in the past as she was Riverside’s leading scorer against UCSB in both matchups last year, averaging 17.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We have to get it done on the defensive end,” Zornig said. “It’s obvious we can score. Our offense is fine this year. But on the defensive end we’ve been struggling, so if we focus on that, we should be fine.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53667\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53667\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/ucsb-in-desperate-need-of-first-big-west-win/","id":580,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[579,578,577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hosts Rival Long Beach State in Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Long Beach State at 8 p.m. on ESPNU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Crowded stands are becoming a regular sight at the Thunderdome for the UCSB men’s basketball team this season.

The big man is certainly motivated not to let the Gauchos lose a second straight game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s definitely important for me; I haven’t beat them yet so it’d be good to get that first win over Long Beach,” Big Al said. “It’s always been a big rivalry: they’ve always been known to play us really tough and us to play them really tough in return. It should be a lot of exciting play on Thursday.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach enters the contest with a 5-11 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference play. The 49ers began Big West play with a narrow loss to UC Irvine on Thursday before handily beating UC Davis on Saturday. Despite sporting a losing record, Long Beach has faced a number of good teams this season, possessing the second strongest non-conference schedule in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great game. Long Beach is a good team. They’ve played a lot of good teams this year,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “Their record doesn’t show how good they are but we know what we need to do coming into this game and we’re going to make sure we come out of this game with a 1-1 record.”</p>\n<p>Bryson will face a tough test defensively as he will match up against junior guard Tyler Lamb, a transfer from UCLA in his first year with Long Beach, who has averaged over 18 points per game in his six games of play since becoming eligible in late December.</p>\n<p>Other Long Beach players to watch will be junior guard Michael Caffey and senior forward Dan Jennings. Caffey is sixth in the conference averaging 16 points per game, while Jennings is fourth in rebounds with 7.5 boards per game. UCSB junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and Big Al will each face tough assignments against Caffey and Jennings.</p>\n<p>“I think [Harmon is] ready to play against Caffey. I think Caffey is a very good player, he does an excellent job,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They also have Jennings who is a great center and Tyler Lamb is one of the best wings in the league. We think Long Beach is one of the top teams in league.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to rebound from Saturday’s loss they will need Bryson along with sophomore forward Taran Brown and senior guard Kyle Boswell to hit outside shots. UCSB shot 2-17 in the loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We put it behind us.

We just need to keep the same confidence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has not defeated the 49ers since the 2011 Big West Tournament Championship Game, which sent the Gauchos to the NCAA Tournament.

The Gauchos held Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and came out victorious despite committing 19 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was important for us to get a win at home. We feel like we shouldn’t lose at home in league for the rest of this year,” sophomore forward Mitch Brewe said. “It was tough coming off Cal Poly, we were lackadaisical and it was a tough game. But we rallied around the crowd, our teammates and coaching staff, and we really came out ready to defend our home court.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach opened the game with a quick 12-6 lead before UCSB responded with an 11-0 run powered by five straight points from sophomore guard Michael Bryson. The Gauchos would lead for the remainder of the half until Long Beach took a brief 22-21 lead with under four minutes left in the half. Tied at 24 and with the final possession, freshman point guard Eric Childress made a brilliant pass to sophomore forward Sam Beeler who slammed the ball home a second before the halftime buzzer to give UCSB a 26-24 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>A quick 9-0 start to the second half stretched the Gaucho lead and UCSB continued to push the 49ers, eventually building a 50-31 lead with just under nine minutes remaining in the contest. Long Beach would rally to as close as eight points with over four minutes left to play by forcing numerous turnovers, but the Gauchos quickly shut the door on any comeback hopes.</p>\n<p>Bryson twice drove baseline and dunked the ball over Long Beach defenders, sandwiching a Sportscenter worthy dunk by sophomore forward Taran Brown that put the game away for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was really happy with the fact that there was some aggressive straight line drives by Michael and Taran, that [Zalmico] was more aggressive,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[I was happy] everybody else on the team felt the need to step up and be more of a weapon offensively because we put too much on pressure on Al when we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Alan Williams who entered the game third in the nation averaging over 24 points per game was held to 12 points in the contest, his second fewest this season. Despite Williams’s lack of scoring, the big man still managed to pull down 15 rebounds, improving his pre-game average of 11.1 per game which ranked sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>Bryson finished the contest with a team-high 13 points to go along with nine rebounds for the Gauchos. Brewe, meanwhile, registered a career-high 12 points and finished 2-2 from behind the three-point line, a recent addition to the power forward’s game.</p>\n<p>“It was important that we had other players make plays,” Coach Williams said. “I think what Long Beach watched was the Cal Poly game where other players didn’t make plays and Al had to carry the load with 33 and 15. What I liked best is Al only gets 12 tonight but he has 15 rebounds again. He stayed after it.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was certainly a factor in this game as junior guard Zalmico Harmon scored seven points to go along with a game-high nine assists for the Gauchos. Long Beach junior point guard Michael Caffey led the team with 21 points but his impact was matched by Harmon’s intensity on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I thought Z was very aggressive and we addressed that and asked him to raise his aggression level. Z has been good as an assist to turnover guy on the year,” Coach Williams said. “For us, the idea that Z was aggressive, that Z scored seven points and gets nine assists, those are good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell finished with eight points and shot 2-5 from behind the arc, while Brown scored six points and pulled down four rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite turning the ball over 12 more times than Long Beach, the Gauchos were efficient with the shot opportunities they had, shooting over 50 percent for the game and 40 percent from the three.</p>\n<p>Long Beach finished 5-27 from three-point land as only one 49er finished the game in double-digit scoring. The 49ers struggled against Santa Barbara’s zone defense as the Gauchos closed down on shooters and forced Long Beach to take plenty of contested outside jumpers.</p>\n<p>“The zone really affected them. The rotations we’ve been working on constantly in practice really came into play in that game,” Brewe said. “And you won’t see a Long Beach team shoot 30 percent very often.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s victory ended a three-game homestand for UCSB in which the Gauchos twice saw large crowds support the team. UCSB will miss the comforts of the Thunderdome as it now embarks on a three-game road trip.</p>\n<p>“It was good for the fans too because they always show great support,” Harmon said. “It was good to get them a win, and get everybody back in the swing of things and show everybody we are the team that we know we are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face Cal State Northridge on Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. contest that will be televised live on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/","id":578,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[577,576,575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by Northridge","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB loses to Northridge after winning 14 straight","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It would be really easy to blame the offense in the UCSB women’s basketball team’s 64-46 blowout loss at home against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Scoring just 46 points, the lowest point total of the year for the Gauchos, Santa Barbara shot a measly 27.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB also committed 13 first half turnovers, allowing Northridge to go on a 17-2 run in which the Gauchos could never recover.

Northridge’s defense bothered the Gauchos’ offense the entirety of the game with Santa Barbara struggling to get a quality shot off. Only one player for UCSB finished in double-figures with Nesbit tallying 13 points and six rebounds on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yet, this is Carlene Mitchell’s team and per usual for her, the problem was on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>“Some of (the offensive troubles) can be pressing too much. Some of that can be taking the wrong shots. I don’t worry about it,” Mitchell said. “It is the defensive side of it. I pulled the stats out from last year for the team and last year we scored 45, we scored 55 and maybe 47 against Northridge. So, here’s that double edge sword that we scored 70 in the first three games and most of the first half of the season, so offense is going to be the question, but my question is, ‘how can we score 46 but also win the game?’”</p>\n<p>Northridge shot 44.8 percent from the field. The Matadors also outscored the Gauchos 34-10 in the paint and outrebounded them 45-31.</p>\n<p>After allowing Northridge to go on the 17-2 run in the first half, Santa Barbara then didn’t contain the Matadors to open the second half, allowing them to start the final period on an 8-1 run, which eventually reached a game-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>“We know we need to stick to our defensive principles,” Nesbit said. “At times, we have lapses in defense, but we know as long as we continue to turn up the intensity on defense and stick to the fundamentals that we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Needing to come from behind has become a recent trend for UCSB, falling behind by large deficits in all three Big West games, and the team hasn’t fared well, going 0-3 in those games.</p>\n<p>“As we continue on the season, we need to learn to put two halves together,” Nesbit said. “We sometimes come out flat in the second half and that tends to snowball, but we know that we need to come out with intensity in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Individually, Janae Sharpe led her team with 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists. She was one of three players in double-figures for Northridge. 6’3’’ sophomore center Bernadette Fong, who averages just 5.8 points per game, made UCSB pay down low, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>The loss snaps a 14 game win streak over Northridge and emphasized the struggles of UCSB recently. The team has dropped eight of its last nine games with its last win coming on Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the Gauchos remain winless in Big West play, dropping to 5-11 overall and 0-3 in conference. Northridge, on the other hand, improves to 7-11 overall and 3-1 in league.</p>\n<p>“We have the answers within us, but its how do we put that together?” Mitchell said. “Talent alone is never enough. I’ll continue to say in our conference, we’re one of the most talented, but at this point, we haven’t meshed as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to action Thursday against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/","id":579,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[578,577,576],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
