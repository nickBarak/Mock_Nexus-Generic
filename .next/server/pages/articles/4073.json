It showed I can’t take anything for granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, Yang finished the 2018 season with a .244 average and — more importantly — a chip on his shoulder heading into the offseason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s belief in his own abilities never faltered; before this season, he stated that one of his goals was to be nominated for the Buster Posey award — given to the top catcher in college baseball. To an outsider, the thought of a recently-benched catcher becoming one of the top catchers in the nation would have seemed absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Yang worked at it, tinkering with his swing in the offseason. One day, senior and fellow catcher Thomas Rowan suggested that Yang use his legs more during his swing. Desperate to find anything that worked, Yang gave it a go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Yang hit two home runs during the team’s scrimmage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of messing with his mechanics, Yang also changed his approach at the plate, inspired in large part by new hitting coach Donegal Fergus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our offensive style is a lot more aggressive this year than it was in the past,” Yang said. “In years past, the staff just wanted us to put the balls in play and not strike out. This year, they want us to hit it in the air and hit home runs. They want us to hit it as hard as we can and not get cheated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change in approach has completely altered the way Yang hits the ball. Last year, Yang grounded out 33 times, with only 39 flyouts. This year, however, he has grounded out 35 times while flying out 62 times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A ground ball does nothing for me, because I’m not fast, so I might as well have my misses in the air,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This significant uptick in fly balls also directly correlates to an increase in power for Yang. After not hitting a single home run last year, Yang has gone deep seven times this season while contributing 45 RBIs. Even when he isn’t going yard, Yang has an uncanny knack for finding the gap, with the backstop tied for the team lead with 16 doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most impressively, Yang’s increase in power hasn’t coincided with a decrease in average, with the catcher hitting an eye-popping .383 out of the three-hole for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s contributions to UCSB’s historic season go far beyond just his bat however. This year, Checketts has allowed Yang to start calling games behind the plate, and the junior has rewarded that trust by helping create one of the strongest pitching staffs in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really close to all of the pitchers, and I even live with [Chris] Lincoln and [Jack] Dashwood, and I think we really bring that chemistry to the mound,” Yang said. “Because our pitching staff is so reliable, it allows me to focus more on hitting [instead of] babysitting the pitchers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, Yang has always been above average; this year the catcher sports a sparkling .995 fielding percentage, as well as an impressive 34.5  caught stealing percentage. Despite his numbers, Yang still believes he has room for improvement on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been able to throw, so that [caught stealing] number is honestly lower than I’d like it to be,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is this drive to be the very best that makes Yang one of the best catchers in the entire country — something that his recent accolades reflect. Last week, Yang accomplished his preseason goal when he was selected as a semifinalist for the Buster Posey award, alongside 13 other catchers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone on that list is a great player, so it was super cool to see my name on there as well,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just yesterday, as if Yang’s season wasn’t already impressive enough, the veteran backstop was named the 2019 Big West Field Player of the Year, becoming the first Gaucho to win the award since Cameron Newell in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting benched halfway through the season to being named the best field player in the conference, perhaps no player in college baseball has improved as much as Yang.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Behind Yang’s resurgent bat, calming presence and consistent defense, UCSB looks poised to make a deep postseason run.

After multiple attempts, UCSC was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students launched the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement in the fall, asking for a proposed monthly stipend of $1,412 to supplement teaching assistants’ (TA) salaries in the face of rising housing prices. Although the movement comes after years of organizing around the issue, UCSC graduate students officially went on a wildcat strike, meaning action without union support, on Dec. 9, 2019. Until now, they have refused to upload grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC Graduate Student Association President </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yulia Gilichinskaya criticized UCSC’s decision to change all missing grades to pass grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The administration has shifted the burden of missing grades from themselves and onto the undergraduates it purports to care for and educate. We cannot allow this,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that some of the students work really hard and really care about getting an A or getting a B. And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system. UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went on full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 27,  meaning TAs ceased teaching and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 55 UCSB graduate students are currently withholding winter quarter grades, according to Sheila Kulkarni, a chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D. student and the Recording Secretary for the UCSB unit of United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW), the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students are beginning to shift from withholding grades to pushing for UAW’s support in striking against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleging that UAW supported wildcat strike efforts and failed to take action to end the strike, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ULP against UAW. Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

team is still in prime position to make some history. Nine of the Gauchos’ remaining 10 games are conference contests, and the winner of the Big West title will likely come down to the last weekend which will pit UCSB against Cal Poly, teams that are tied for first in the conference with 12-3 marks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Santa Barbara cannot get too ahead of itself, even if it faces a Long Beach State team this weekend that sits dead last in the standings with a 5-10 Big West record and 11-35 overall mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State is just two years removed from nearly reaching the College World Series before being eliminated by Big West foe Cal State Fullerton, but it is now on pace to have one of its worst seasons in decades.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program also fired nine-year coach Troy Buckley on April 11 after a reported incident of workplace violence. Buckley was 260-231-1 during his tenure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his firing, however, LBSU has managed to turn things around a bit. After starting the season 5-26, Long Beach State has won six of its last 15 games, including a sweep of UC Riverside — the only team to take two of three from the Gauchos this season — and nearly knocking off No. 1 UCLA this past Tuesday, losing in 12 innings 2-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That may not seem like much, but it does highlight about how far this program has come in just the past month of play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, even in those 15 contests, LBSU has tallied 130 hits which is about eight hits per game, a solid number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s .259 batting average as a whole might not seem great over the past 15, but it is up more than 48 points than where it was before. Overall, the team sports a .234 batting average which is dead last in the conference but, again, higher than it was before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LBSU’s pitching staff has also been revived during conference play. The Dirtbags have allowed the second-least hits (121) in conference play. The staff also holds the second-best ERA (4.67).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, despite LBSU’s record, the team does put up a fight in each contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve of Long Beach State’s last 15 games have been decided by two runs or fewer, with seven of those meetings being decided by just one run. The Dirtbags have gone just 1-6 in those seven one-run games and are 3-2 in matches decided by two runs over that span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a few more things go right for them in some of these games, LBSU might be contending for a title as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UCSB should still roll through the Dirtbags. The Gauchos’ pitching staff has combined to strike out 399 batters this season, topping the Big West. LBSU strikes out a good amount with 323 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Santa Barbara’s offensive firepower might be too much for the Dirtbags to even think of overcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right fielder Armani Smith has been on a tear lately as he currently owns a nine-game hitting streak. During that stretch, Smith has had five multiple hit games and gone an impressive 14 for 34 (.411) while also scoring seven runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recent stretch has also seen his batting average jump 24 points as he now sports a .319 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Martinez, Calif. native has accumulated one fourth of his total RBIs this season in just the last nine games for a total of 10. Smith also has 10 homers on the season, second best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Gauchos have been especially tough to beat at home, owning an impressive 22-1 record in home games this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has won 15 consecutive games in Santa Barbara with the team’s last home loss coming on Mar. 17 against Cal Baptist. If the team can sweep, UCSB will have set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos last set that record in 2016 when they won 17 consecutive games. That was the same year UCSB went to its first ever College World Series. Coincidence? I guess we’ll find out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First pitch between LBSU and UCSB will begin at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Instead, Cal Poly concludes its season 28-28 overall and 17-7 in Big West play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite it being senior day for the Gauchos, it was the young freshman on the mound who really solidified this win for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left-handed pitcher Rodney Boone pitched an amazing game Saturday. In possibly the biggest game of his career, the freshman tossed 8.1 innings, striking out a career-high 12 batters and allowing just five hits and three walks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the plate, UCSB tallied a solid 10 hits to score seven runs. In the previous two games of the series, Santa Barbara had just eight hits and three runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The run support for Boone came early; in the bottom of the first inning, the Gauchos were able to get two across the plate, thanks to an RBI single from sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez and an RBI groundout from junior right fielder Armani Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third, two more were runs scored for UCSB due to RBI singles from Smith and junior center fielder Tommy Jew. Jew was one of the six Santa Barbara athletes to be celebrated on Senior Day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were hoping to chill today and relax with our families but we had to come in ready and locked in. To be able to celebrate with everyone is special,” Jew said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other honorees include right-handed pitchers Alex Patterson, Liam Steigerwald, Kevin Chandler, left fielder Michael McAdoo and left fielder Tevin Mitchell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Jew, the junior went two for four on the day to finish the regular season batting .282 with 39 RBI’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two more runs came across in the fourth, following a triple from shortstop McClain O’Connor which brought in both a run and a sacrifice fly from Martinez to bring in O’Connor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in the seventh, Mitchell blasted his fifth home run of the year to left field, giving his team a commanding 7-0 lead. Mitchell was a standout player for UCSB all year hitting his career-high five home runs and tying the team lead in stolen bases at 20.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As dominant as Boone was, it appeared that Checketts would let him finish the outing off. Instead, the plan was to let him get one final out before bringing in closer Chris Lincoln to finish off the score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After striking out the leadoff batter, Boone got the call and left the field to a standing ovation for his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an awesome moment and an amazing feeling,” Boone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincoln came in needing just two outs to finish off the Mustangs. He struck out the first batter then got the final one to ground to third. Third baseman Jason Willow picked up the ball, spun around and launched it to Kyle Johnson at first who secured the catch for the final out of the ball game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team was all smiles after the ball game, with many players hugging each other and the championship trophy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t explain it. This is probably the happiest I have been in years. I love each and every one of these guys and I just could not be happier,” senior Thomas Rowan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowan was honored last year on Senior day which is why he did not participate in the activities today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past eight seasons, Checketts has accomplished a considerable amount since becoming the head coach of the program. He led the program to many bests including most wins in a single season at the Division 1 level with 45 wins this year and even its first-ever College World Series in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting the program’s first Big West title in 30-plus years is very special and a testament to how far this team has come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSB moves onto bigger things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We struggled with our identities the past few years but this year we found it. If you’re going to come at us, you better give us your best because we are a resilient team and we don’t care who we play in the regionals. We just want to show what we got,” Jew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will find out whether or not they host a regional on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. The team will then find out its bracket at 9 a.m. Monday morning. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
