You may remember me from such <em>Gaucho Marks</em> articles as “Queer Spanish Teacher Forces Students To Conjugate Preferred Gender Pronouns” and “Deltopia Sexual Assault Victims Tacitly Agree Now’s Not The Best Time To Mention It.” If not, look them up. I’m sure many of you will experience the same reflexive outrage that readers felt when Gaucho Marks, the humor/satire magazine I founded in my second year, first published them. You were also probably offended by a satirical “Nexustentialism” piece in the <em>Daily Nexus</em> that joked about the Islamic State terrorist group establishing a caliphate in FT. Don’t bother looking that one up, because the editors of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> removed it from the website after what appears to have been a fairly negative Internet reaction.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of an incident a few years back involving the greatest inspiration to both <em>Gaucho Marks</em> and the Nexustentialism section. At the 2013 Academy Awards, the <em>Onion</em>, a Pulitzer-deserving bastion of news satire, live-tweeted the red carpet news coverage of the ceremony. After a close up of “Beasts of the Southern Wild” star and nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, the <em>Onion</em> tweeted, “That Quvenzhane Wallis is kind of a cunt, right?” That tweet caused an enormous backlash on Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, Reddit and probably made for a pretty good icebreaker on Tinder. The outrage reached such a pitch that, for the first time in its 20-year history, the <em>Onion</em> apologized for one of its remarks. A publication that frequently receives threats and cease-and-desist letters for its caustic, satirical content finally caved under the pressure of the online commentariat.</p>\n<p>As an avid fan of the<em> Onion</em>, I was appalled and ashamed. These were the same people that published articles like “School Bully Not So Tough After Being Molested” and “Autistic Child Ruins Marriage He Was Born To Save.” Besides, anybody who really thought about the tweet would have gotten the joke; people are so quick to express hatred towards celebrities merely for the attention they get, so what if those same feelings were directed at a nine-year-old girl? Satire’s core purpose is to expose an issue by caricaturizing it, and the idea that somebody would call a little girl a cunt the same way they’d call Gwyneth Paltrow a cunt is ludicrous. If anything, the Internet’s reaction to the article was proof of its efficacy. But instead of reflecting upon the way they react to celebrity culture, as I’m sure was the tweet’s intent, the great digital hive swarmed to its battle stations and wagged a massive finger at the <em>Onion</em> for even suggesting that Ms. Wallis is a “c-word.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Maybe I’m reading too much into it, and if I’m being honest with myself, the context doesn’t change the fact that the tweet was a pretty weak joke. But the<em> Onion</em> hurt itself by apologizing. Over the past 20 years, The <em>Onion</em> has created its own universe. In this universe, Joe Biden is a beer-swilling, hard-partying Lothario who washes muscle cars in the White House driveway, famous athletes behave like elementary school children and the Royal Baby is the spawn of Satan. The <em>Onion</em>’s apology for the Wallis tweet shattered that universe and reminded us that the <em>Onion</em>, just like every other media outlet, actually exists in a world that punishes weirdoes, hates clowns and feels entitled to the same cozy emotional treatment that babies get (why do you think our generation misses the 90s so much?). Reading that apology was like watching Charlie Chaplin clean up a mess he made in one of his many iconic slapstick scenes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, 600 words into this op-ed and I still haven’t talked about the Nexustentialism piece. “ISIS Seizes FT, Establishes Gaucho Caliphate” is kind of offensive, sure. It’s offensive to a terrorist network that just happens to call itself “Islamic” despite expressing a perverted interpretation of the Quran. However, neither ISIS, nor its victims, are the subject of the joke. What’s funny about ISIS establishing a caliphate in FT is the sentiment that the infamous housing complex is a bacchanalian hell hole that would crumble under so-called Islamic rule (a secondary joke in the piece is that the I.V. Foot Patrol wouldn’t do anything about the caliphate). The only people who should be insulted by the article are ISIS, FT residents and the local police. ISIS will take care of the <em>Nexus</em> once it’s done dealing with the rest of the planet, FT residents probably won’t remember reading this long enough to hold a real grudge and the police can fuck themselves if they don’t like it; they’re the police. If you read the article without really thinking about the subtext, you would assume that it’s merely trivializing the Islamic State’s horrific actions for the sake of humor. However, the article is more effective (yes, <em>Daily Nexus</em> staff, I finally admitted that you know how to do this. Bake your own damn cookies) because it brings that horror to Isla Vista. It’s an example of what’s known as Juvenalian satire, or satire that caricaturizes the darkest aspects of humanity as a means of criticizing them and starting a conversation. The typing tantrum thrown by the <em>Nexus</em> readers clearly demonstrates that it worked.</p>\n<p>“Now, wait a minute, Matt. I doubt the <em>Daily Nexus</em> consciously wrote that piece with social and political justice in mind. I’m pretty sure they just wanted to make an ISIS joke about UCSB and get clicks, much the same way you once used abortion, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and tons of other serious issues to do the same!” You may be right, disgruntled fake person. Let’s assume for a moment that you are. The <em>Daily Nexus</em> made a dumb, exploitative, offensive joke in its satire column. So what? It’s a satire column. It is, by nature, offensive. Furthermore, it’s more offensive to those who deserve ridicule than those who don’t. But rather than stick to their guns and remember the barrels in which their ink is bought, the <em>Daily Nexus</em> decided that being liked was better than being clever. And honestly, I understand that decision, especially in light of the budget cuts the paper has had to make. Would the article really have caused enough of a fuss that advertisers might threaten to close their accounts, as I’m sure they did for the <em>Onion</em> after the Wallis tweet? Or would the backlash have dissipated in days, as it always does, leaving both the <em>Nexus</em> and its easily-bruised readers exactly the same as before?</p>\n<p>Retracting that piece hurts the <em>Daily Nexus</em> even more than apologizing for the Wallis tweet hurt the <em>Onion</em>. It shows that they don’t care about integrity, or intent or even comedy. They care about image. They care more about pandering to their readers than challenging them. It shows that they’re scared of dialogue, and therefore scared of satire. If that’s the case, they shouldn’t be producing it. When I briefly wrote for that same column, my editor imposed many restrictions on the content of my submissions, such as not using the President’s real name (“what about ‘Flobama’? That’s funny, right?”). Satire does not flourish with boundaries. You can’t just apply the same editorial standards to which your journalism adheres to a piece of comedy. It isn’t an easy form of writing, and doing it badly only makes the real news look worse. As Ron Swanson once said, “Don’t half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.” The <em>Princeton Review</em> thought the <em>Daily Nexus</em> was pretty good without the satire column. I say if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve shat upon the<em> Daily Nexus</em> enough, I’ll turn my attention to its pissed-off readers, and the pissed-off readers of <em>Gaucho Marks</em>, and the <em>Onion</em> and any other comic who’s fallen victim to the sonorous whine of the Internet. Do you have any idea how weak you look when you direct your anger at comedians? These are the people trying to make suffering palatable, to spread optimism and perspective into the darkest places, to make you laugh, damn it. When you take that away from them, and from the people who depend on them, you’re damaging the world in ways that ISIS only dreams of. If ISIS knew that Americans were afraid of joking about them, I promise you they’d laugh. They’re laughing now. They’re laughing while they behead and rape people because they know that we won’t do anything about it. We’re too scared. We’re too weak. And it’s your fault. You waste your time haranguing those of us who are trying to whittle away at terror, bit by bit, because you’re too cowardly to do it yourself, too powerless to make real change. Your causes, while just, suffer when you behave this way. Who wants to be championed by someone without the mettle to withstand a joke, especially a bad one? How do you expect to stop injustice when its mere caricature cuts you this deeply? The next time that you see or hear bad satire, ignore it. Or, even better, figure out how to improve upon it. Just don’t blow your next anger-gasm at comedians. They’re doing more for the world than you are.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Javidi is a ‘14 UCSB alumnus and the former Editor of</em> Gaucho Marks.</p>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

It also found a significant rise in infant cancers, deaths and low birth weights in SLO and Santa Barbara Counties after the reactors began operating. In the decades after the Rancho Seco nuclear plant (near Sacramento) closed in 1989, cancer rates declined and other health trends improved dramatically.</p>\n<p>In addition to these health findings, the Academy found that in the 30 years that Diablo Canyon has been operating, no governmental agency has ever investigated its impact on the health of people living near the reactors — not the SLO Health Department, not the State Department of Health, not PG&amp;E and not the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. PG&amp;E and the nuclear industry have tried to dismiss this report by the childish approach of name-calling (i.e., “junk science” or “fear mongering”), showing a blatant disregard for the health of their neighbors, customers and employees. The reason PG&amp;E resorts to the 5th grade tactics of name-calling is that (1) they have done zero health studies of their own; (2) they have no research that shows that Diablo Canyon is NOT harmful to people living nearby; and, therefore, (3) they prefer to “shoot the messenger,” rather than seriously discuss this issue.<br>\n<em>Maile Ellington is a Santa Barbara resident. </em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB and are primarily submitted by students.</p>\n<p>A Version of this article appeared in the Monday, May 19, 2014 print issue of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-18/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-and-how-it-might-be-killing-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-18/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-and-how-it-might-be-killing-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-18/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-and-how-it-might-be-killing-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-18/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-and-how-it-might-be-killing-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-18/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-and-how-it-might-be-killing-you/","id":6134,"author":{"id":621,"name":"Maile Ellington"},"related":[6133,6132,6131],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Depression is a profound learning experience …","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/depression.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/depression.png?resize=800%2C480&ssl=1","description":"… You learn that eating two pounds of trail mix in five minutes is not a good idea.

You try eliminating different food groups from your diet, exercising continuously, meditating and practicing yoga, but you’re still mired in a fog.</p>\n<p>As the days go by and nothing seems to change, you slowly begin to realize and accept that this may be something that stays with you for the rest of your life. There are brief moments where the cloud that’s suppressing your mind breaks apart and allows some happiness or clever thoughts to shine through, but the cloud always returns.</p>\n<p>You spend half an hour sitting motionless in your car because you lack the willpower to get out and walk the 50 feet to your house. You wonder if this is all just a matter of willpower — that maybe you could just choose to be happy and energized if you tried hard enough.</p>\n<p>Eventually this notion fades away, and for better or worse you make peace with the person you’ve become.</p>\n<p>You stop hoping that people will take pity on you, stop lamenting all the things you could be doing if you weren’t depressed, stop worrying about whether your friends think you’re as fun to hang out with anymore and lose your fears about almost everything. Whether this is due to apathy or a newfound maturity is difficult to tell.</p>\n<p>You learn the value of genuine kindness, and make the effort to thank people in your life who you’d never bothered to thank before you were depressed. You notice the listless atmosphere when you take the bus, and wish there was something you could do to change it beyond saying “Good morning” to the driver. You buy a Guy Fawkes mask on State Street just to try to amuse yourself, and laugh when you think of putting it on in the waiting room of the doctor’s office. You look forward to talking with the friendly female cashier when you go to the grocery store, but not much else.</p>\n<p>The blind desire to survive never leaves you, but you don’t know why. You see quotes like “Ignorance is bliss” and “Gaiety is wiser than wisdom” and know that they’re true, but despite knowing that, and despite knowing how awful depression can be, you’re still glad you ended up on this path because now you’re aware of things you never would have known otherwise.</p>\n<p>You feel like you’re a better person because of what you’ve been through, and hope that maybe this is all part of a long, arduous journey, an adventure of sorts, and that someday you’ll feel a sense of fulfillment from it.</p>\n<p>You don’t know if happiness will ever come but, like the Count of Monte Cristo, you wait and hope. Depression has motivated you to change the unhealthy patterns of thought and behavior that led you here, and you continue to transform yourself, because maybe if you change enough you’ll eventually overcome this enormous adversary. There is always more you can do, more you can learn, so you keep looking.</p>\n<p>Connor Hastings is a graduate student of environmental science and management.</p>\n<div class=\"mceMediaCredit mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/depression-profound-learning-experience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/depression-profound-learning-experience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/depression-profound-learning-experience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/depression-profound-learning-experience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-16/depression-profound-learning-experience/","id":6135,"author":{"id":538,"name":"Connor Hastings"},"related":[6134,6133,6132],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For Us All: A Love Letter to Our Students","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IV-Vigil_JohnClow_05.24.2014_07.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IV-Vigil_JohnClow_05.24.2014_07.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Professor Fradenburg speaks on behalf of the entire faculty to reiterate that the UCSB staff stands in support of its students and community. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB is a research university. That means that faculty are engaged in pursuits they feel passionately about, whether they are contributing to research on aging, or trying to understand why the arts have been so valuable to our species as to have forever been our companions. These preoccupations often seem to take priority over teaching and getting to know our students. We teach a lot of large lecture classes. We dream about sabbaticals. But UCSB promotes undergraduate research as a way of involving undergraduates directly in that part of our mission, and we also teach (and wish we could teach more) small seminars, and we work with our undergraduates in labs, through internships or research assistanceships, on senior theses, in campus activism and on committees.</p>\n<p>We don’t always know our students’ names, but even if we don’t, we know our students’ faces. You keep us thinking about what matters and about what we still need to learn. You keep us young. We hope we give you things too — a feeling for what a body of knowledge is and can do, ways of thinking, making and doing that change your brains and minds forever — so that all we’ve learned in the past can be part of what you will take into the future we won’t otherwise be able to share with you. Our minds and our hearts are so much more entwined than we realize.</p>\n<p>What the faculty have learned in the aftermath of the Isla Vista shootings is how much we love our students. Perhaps love isn’t the right word for the bonds that link people who think, learn and work together, who share interests, or even fascinations. We need a richer lexicon to describe these relationships. But we will use the word because it expresses something of the intensity of our concern, regard and gratitude for you.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We love you. You are part of us, and we are part of you. We know learning is difficult and that you have to cope with a lot of boredom and anxiety every day. We know we don’t always connect well with you, as people or as experts in our fields. But when news of the shootings spread, we were desperate to know whether or not you were okay. We emailed you, telephoned you and scanned news sources, hoping you would not be among the dead and injured, feeling dreadful because we knew somebody had to be among the dead and injured, someone who was smart and hopeful, someone who was important. We’ve been so relieved to hear from you, so worried when we haven’t. We’ve all been overtaken by our feelings. But we are glad to know, and want you to know, how much you mean to us.</p>\n<p>Research on social connectivity is growing more brilliant every day. There is still much we don’t know about how feelings and ideas become, or always already are, communal phenomena. But we know that feelings and ideas are transpersonal. And so we know — partly because we are part of a knowledge-making community — how true it is that we are all affected by the shootings, how much we have reached out to each other and how long it will be before we can enjoy again the shockingly good fortune of being alive. We are just so terribly sorry for those who had to leave us before they were ready.</p>\n<p>Please be well. If we can help, tell us, and we will help you. If you need peace and quiet, we will be respectful. If you want to cry, we will cry with you. We will protest the unfairness of life right alongside of you. Please be well, and remember that we love you.<br>\n<em><br>\nAranye Fradenburg, Ph.D., is a professor of English and Comparative Literature at UCSB.</em></p>\n<h6>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-27/for-us-all-a-love-letter-to-our-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-27/for-us-all-a-love-letter-to-our-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-27/for-us-all-a-love-letter-to-our-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-27/for-us-all-a-love-letter-to-our-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-27/for-us-all-a-love-letter-to-our-students/","id":6136,"author":{"id":623,"name":"Aranye Fradenburg"},"related":[6135,6134,6133],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
