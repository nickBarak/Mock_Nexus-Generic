Legislative Council meeting, members approved the Human Rights Board as an A.S. committee by a 20-1 vote. Following Arreola’s decision, the council, which can override a veto by a two-thirds vote, will address the matter at its meeting tonight.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Arreola called into question several of the bill’s elements, noting problems with its financial and organizational plans. The bill states that the new board will have a projected $0 fiscal impact for A.S. The HRB, however, calls for a Treasurer, Event Coordinator, Freshmen First-Year and Outreach Coordinator, as well as two Human Rights weeks per academic year, Arreola noted.</p>\n<p>“I do not see how any of these efforts will be possible without tapping into the Associated Students unallocated dollars,” Arreola wrote.</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, Arreola’s veto was a well thought-out decision.</p>\n<p>“I agree with his veto,” Wendle said. “…as the IVP looking at the structure of A.S., in my opinion there is evidence that shows that A.S. is expanding a little too fast… We need to appeal to what we have now; make our student government run a little more efficiently and understand exactly where our money is right now before we spend any more on new A.S. boards.”</p>\n<p>Arreola also listed other reasons for vetoing the HRB, including concerns about the vague nature of the group’s organizational structure, which calls for permanent directors from six non-A.S. groups and two A.S. groups. Another potential problem, Arreola wrote, is the HRB’s mission statement.</p>\n<p>“These set parameters allow for the proposed HRB to take stances on political issues, which we have seen Legislative Council struggle with in the past,” Arreola said. “By approving this bill, Legislative Council will be legitimizing a board that can potentially take a stance on political issues. This can potentially place the Associated Students in a compromising position by marginalizing the student body.”</p>\n<p>Nicolas Pascal, director of the UCSB Human Rights Council, said he was disappointed that Arreola did not share his concerns earlier.</p>\n<p>“I would have preferred that he would have worked with the Leg Council members who were working very seriously in the drafting of this bill,” Pascal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/","id":3161,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3160,3159,3158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Spring Election forums will continue next Tuesday through Thursday and students can vote for candidates and lock-in fees on GOLD from April 18 to 21.</p>\n<p>Mostafa and Madarang discussed budget cuts, giving a voice to underrepresented student groups and proposed expanding student lobbying efforts in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>If elected, Mostafa said his main goal would be protecting students’ accessibility to higher education.</p>\n<p>“I see in this room a group of students that all share a common goal: to get an affordable, quality education,” Mostafa said. “My overarching goals are to unify the student body, staff and administrators. These budget cuts affect us all and together we can all mobilize over the common goal of protecting our educations. We need to tell legislatures true stories of how budget cuts have affected students and make our stories truly heard.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she plans to promote student involvement in UC Board of Regents decisions.</p>\n<p>“I would like to expand lobbying efforts both at the capital and in the local area to make sure that money goes to our school system,” Madarang said. “Students should be in the forefront of every decision made on this campus. There should be another student seat on the Regents so that we have more representation in decisions made for us by the UC Regents.”</p>\n<p>Mostafa said he would also strive to make the EVPSA office more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“I want every student to know what the office is and that every student can come in and be exposed to it,” Mostafa said. “I would restructure positions and create positions that advocate for student groups on campus that are underrepresented on [Associated Students] such as the engineering department and the Greek community. I want a campus that knows what the EVPSA office is and a campus that participates in our events.”</p>\n<p>Madarang said she fears that California Governor Jerry Brown’s budget cuts will make a UC education unaffordable in the future.</p>\n<p>“[Tuition increases] would make a college education unattainable for many students,” Madarang said. “I have successfully lobbied Gavin Newsom’s staff and other governing bodies and would encourage students to become involved in protecting their education.”</p>\n<p>Audience member Tiffany Mayville, an off-campus representative and fourth-year environmental studies major, said the election forums reveal how prepared each candidate is for his or her prospective position.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes students come forward and want a position, but don’t know what the office really entails,” Mayville said. “Forums show us whether a candidate knows the position they’re running for and therefore how well they’ll do in that position.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-08/candidates-open-discussion/","id":3158,"author":{"id":215,"name":"Christina Lavingia"},"related":[3157,3156,3155],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prospective Presidents Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students held its second and final open forum for presidential candidates yesterday in the Hub.

Voting will be accessible through GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major and current Student Advocate General, said he would promote transparency and student outreach within the association.</p>\n<p>“Most students have no clue about what A.S. is doing on campus or where their funds are going,” Weber said. “We need to streamline the information being sent out to our student population and provide a monthly or weekly report about where those fees are going.”</p>\n<p>Weber said he would also seek to confront a recent trend of student apathy.</p>\n<p>“There are significantly more people at the undie run every quarter than at the budget rallies and protests,” Weber said. “Gaucho spirit does exist, we just need to channel it so we can tackle big issues, like the budget cuts.”</p>\n<p>Democratic Process Party candidate Stanley Tzankov, a third-year political science major and current off-campus representative, said he would work to implement the “core four” ideas at the heart of DPP’s plans for A.S.</p>\n<p>“I will create solutions that make the most of our resources, utilize the Office of the President to organize projects and programs to reach out to our students, work on student retention rates and engage the administration, student body and local government to all work together, especially in this time of budget cuts,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Tzankov said his work reaching out to marginalized students prepared him well for the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>“The budget cuts over the last few years have hit the disadvantaged and minority population very hard; it can be seen in the retention rates,” Tzankov said. “I have worked on providing an emergency loan service to disadvantaged and financially marginalized students. As president, I will appoint a Commissioner of Diversity and Equity who would plan events work on publicity.”</p>\n<p>Bettering Our School System’s candidate Marcus Rochellle, a third-year political science major and current finance board member, said he would work on the smaller issues on campus as well as addressing major budget concerns.</p>\n<p>“I believe it’s important to address the issues around campus as well as the bigger budget issues,” Rochellle said. “Improving the way we register for classes and expanding the wireless internet on campus are ways we can take measurable steps to improve lives on a day-to-day basis.”</p>\n<p>Rochellle said student collaboration will be critical for devising realistic solutions to break the cycle of budget cuts that disadvantage UC students.</p>\n<p>“The greatest untapped resource on campus is the students,” Rochellle said. “We need to harness the passion and spirit of the student body to address these issues with a unified front. We can let the state legislature know how much money we can make as graduates of college and how higher education really benefits the state.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36326\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36326\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/prospective-presidents-debate/","id":3159,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3158,3157,3156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leg Council Funds A.S.

Election Committee’s funding for their “Votetopia” campaign to mobilize student participation in the Spring Election during last night’s five-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The Council allocated additional funding for Votetopia from its Special Projects account to supplement the funding it received after originally requesting $7,543 from Finance Board to rent Corwin Pavilion and provide four times as many T-shirts for the event. The Council approved an allocation of $2,200 to the campaign, including $800 for free T-shirts, $360 for stickers and $200 for the results announcement.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair Sunjeet Gill said although over 40 percent of undergraduate students voted in last year’s Spring Election, she hopes the campaign will motivate an even higher turnout.</p>\n<p>“These shirts can be worn year after year and we thought the theme would be fun,” Gill said. “We want more and more of a percentage to get out and vote each year.”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said she thinks it will be difficult to distribute the T-shirts during the association’s four-day campaign.</p>\n<p>“I did a month-long campaign once and even then it was hard to give away T-shirts with heavy publicizing,” Mayorga said. “There are so many T-shirts being given out already that it might be an overload.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said he feels the Elections Committee has already spent an excessive amount on advertising for Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>“My main issue with this is that they paid almost $10,000 in ads,” Lopez said. “People who read the Nexus generally read it every day and they don’t need to see these ads in issue after issue.”</p>\n<p>Some representatives suggested cost-cutting options such as announcing election results at a smaller venue and using an MP3 player instead of hiring a DJ.</p>\n<p>The Council also passed a Resolution to Support the Execution of the Student-Initiated Democratic Education, a program that would allow undergraduate students to teach pass/no pass seminars.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Council approved a Resolution to Support the Implementation of the A.S. Food Bank. According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the food bank will be operational shortly.</p>\n<p>The Council continued discussion about plans for their Isla Vista Annex and A.S. café. An informational meeting about the café will be held in the MultiCultural Center’s Multi-Purpose Room on April 28.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-14/leg-council-funds-votetopia/","id":3160,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3159,3158,3157],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
