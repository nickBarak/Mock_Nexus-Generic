Office of the President and UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, aimed to address student needs through an open discussion facilitated by university administration and mental health specialists, followed by a Q&amp;A portion and discussion groups. The event concluded with a brief tour of campus resources at different tables. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With this structure for the town hall, we hope to provide a forum where members of the UCSB community can easily and safely voice their concerns and be a valuable part of the process to improve our campus climate on mental health,” Sejal Anuraji, mental health coordinator for the A.S. Office of the President, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current climate and stigma around mental health at UCSB was examined in detail to help service providers understand where they needed to fill in the gaps, according to A.S. President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students argued at the town hall that UCSB should be focused on making mental health services more visible to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mental health affects students’ everyday lives … from academic success to relationships to self-care and I hope to see more advertisement of the resources available,” Anna Talamantes, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said in a discussion group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A variety of UCSB mental health services were represented at the town hall, including  leadership and mental health professionals from Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, members of the A.S. Office of the President and other university administration members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharleen O’Brien, director of the Mental Health Task Force, said the event was organized with the intention of introducing the student body to the task force and making them aware of its role on campus. O’Brien described the Mental Health Task Force as centered around three main goals: mobilizing additional campus resources, increasing visibility and accessibility of services and gaining feedback from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mental Health Task Force was introduced by O’Brien as a new coalition for change, at the beginning of the event. O’Brien further identified members of the task force in the room and explained their purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Mental Health Task Force was constituted to work on better coordination among campus services and to develop enhanced communication that makes it more clear to students, faculty and staff how to access services and what resources are provided through each department,” Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, said at the town hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the “fishbowl” discussion portion among several UCSB staff members and students, they highlighted key obstacles and discussed where these issues stem from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait times for C.A.P.S. services are one of the biggest obstacles for students to receive care, according to Brian Olowude, director of C.A.P.S. Students are often discouraged by the waiting period between appointments, and there is currently a struggle to determine the best way to solve this issue without compromising quality care, Olowude said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude added it has also been a challenge to learn how to effectively educate students about other campus mental health services besides C.A.P.S. — such as C.A.R.E and the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program — that may better fit their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several campus organizations also had the opportunity to table at the event and answer attendees’ questions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) was one such organization, which sought to increase its visibility and presence in the mental health conversation at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many survivors don’t know that C.A.R.E. is not just about advocacy — it’s also very much focused on overall student mental health and well-being,” Shalmali Patil, a C.A.R.E peer educator and third-year psychological and brain sciences and statistics and data science double major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also discussed intersectionality in relation to mental health, voicing concerns about finding resources that are accessible to their unique communities and people who understand the particular issues they might encounter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are often certain obstacles and challenges faced uniquely by minority communities. I also hope to see a more accessible and clear directory showing which resources are available to students for a variety of different issues,” Sir said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate crisis was another growing area of concern that can impact mental well-being, Julia Fine, a doctoral student in linguistics, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our studies indicate that high levels of concern, anxiety, anger and grief are all connected to the climate crisis … [so we are] interested in how we can use the resources on campus to support student climate activists,” Fine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said a follow-up to the town hall is scheduled to take place sometime in the near future and said that she hopes that the follow-up will help establish tangible change to campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this can be an ongoing event for years to come so that we can continue to provide a platform for the community to give their input and conduct a friendly check-in on the state of UCSB’s student resources.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/07/2020, 3:55 p.m.]: A previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Shalmali Patil is a third-year psychological and brain science major. She is a C.A.R.E. peer educator who is double majoring in psychological and brain science and statistics and data science. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/","id":3385,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3384,3383,3382],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel","biography":"Not available","articles":[1924,1955,3292,3368,3385,3389,4035,4103,4286],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"X’s and O’s: Breaking Down the 2018 FIFA World Cup Groups (A-D)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lots of buzz in the sports world for this year is due to the 2018 FIFA World Cup beginning this summer in June.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup, set to take place in Russia, has recently been all the talk around the world. After years of qualification matches and cheering on their international side, fans of the beautiful game are celebrating their nation’s ticket to the biggest stage in world football.<br>\nFortunately, the wait until the summer of 2018 won’t be too uneventful thanks to the World Cup drawing event that recently took place at the start of December. Now, with the group stage set and tensions high, the country comparisons will start to occur as analysts will weigh each team’s chances at advancing past the group stage. This leads me to my unbiased predictions of the drawing’s results … especially since the United States didn’t qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Group A: Russia, Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>The Hosts Draw a Favorable Batch</em></p>\n<p>For those not in the know concerning the World Cup’s group draw, each team, excluding the host nation, which is always granted the first slot, starts off placed in a competitive pot that is shared with other teams of nearly similar FIFA men’s rankings. So, for informational purposes, every group is ordered by skill level as listed.<br>\nThe host nation of Russia is a part of the first four designated sides. Uruguay and Egypt are the Top 30 teams in Russia’s way, while Saudi Arabia is ranked just below them. Historically speaking, host nations tend to perform well at their World Cups, even if they are undervalued on paper, as in Russia’s case. Nevertheless, we see Uruguay and Russia going through unless Egypt has something to say about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Group B: Portugal, Spain, Iran, Morocco</strong></p>\n<p><em>Two Giants, Two Dreams</em></p>\n<p>Both Portugal and Spain have been considered Top 10 in world football for years now. However, if you’re asking FIFA, they’re even better. Coming in at No. 3 and No. 6 respectively, Portugal and Spain appear to be clear-cut favorites to stand at the top of their groups when all is said and done. Unless a pair of upset losses occur within this group stage, the Top-35 side Iran and closely following Morocco won’t have much of a chance due to all the star power on the opposition. Nevertheless, the Portugal vs. Spain match should provide a must-watch competition for all fans alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Group C: France, Peru, Denmark, Australia</strong></p>\n<p><em>A Battle for Positioning</em></p>\n<p>At a quick glance, one may make the mistake to simply jump to the conclusion that France has this one in the bag. Think again. Ranked at No. 9 overall, France barely holds a lead in the standings when considering Peru is placed at 11th next to 12th place Denmark. Peru is hungry for a good group stage finish after not qualifying for the World Cup for 36 years, and Denmark is a source for quality talent amongst Europe’s elite clubs. Sure, we’ll cheer on the Australian underdogs, but it seems like France will have its work cut out when having to deal with a group that is capable of top-tier play.</p>\n<p><strong>Group D: Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p><em>Messi is No Group Stage Guarantee</em></p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right: “Messi is no group stage guarantee.” Why would we word the headline as such? Well, this Argentina team has played fairly average whenever Messi is absent from the roster. Is this a lack of performance from a side full of star power, or are they just simply missing the best player in world football? Regardless of the correct answer, this group is still very much competitive considering its circumstances. Croatia is home to some of the best football-playing athletes, and Iceland is truly living a Cinderella story of success. And, oh yeah, the 51st ranked Nigeria just came off a 4-2 thrashing over the No. 4 overall Argentina. We’ll still give it just barely to Argentina, followed by perhaps the most surprising of all the group stages’ victors: Nigeria.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/","id":3382,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3381,3380,3379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"X’s and O’s: Breaking Down the 2018 FIFA World Cup Groups (E-H)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lots of buzz in the sports world for this year is due to the 2018 FIFA World Cup beginning this summer in June.

They claimed the top of the CONMEBOL qualification league fairly easily in South America, and now they’ll be one of the favorites to take it all in Russia. That being said, Switzerland and Serbia are still both powerful European sides, although Costa Rica might jump ahead of them both, as they proved their side deserved global recognition following last year’s World Cup. In the end, there will be several great matches to watch here, and by several we only mean all three of Brazil’s games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Group F: Germany, Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Champions Draw the Group of Death</em></p>\n<p>The “Group of Death” is pretty self-explanatory as is, but for the sake of learning it is considered the most competitive and unpredictable group. Regardless, the German team has been the poster boy for elite football for several years now, especially after coming off winning the World Cup. As for Mexico and Sweden, it may very well come down to either of them as they’ll try to secure the second spot in this group. Although, the last time we underestimated South Korea, they somehow made it to the World Cup semifinal…and then were beat by Germany.</p>\n<p><strong>Group G: Belgium, England, Tunisia, Panama</strong></p>\n<p><em>England Just Might Get the Job Done</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a recurring meme that circulates around this time that pretty much revolves around the fact that England invented this sport, yet still sucks at it. However, after the group stage drawing, fans of England should rejoice. Tunisia and Panama aren’t near the Top 16 rankings of both England and Belgium, so there might just be a chance for England. “A chance” being the key phrase here, since Tunisia or Panama might very well join Belgium in advancing out of the group stage, and we wouldn’t even consider it an upset result.<br>\nWe’d apologize for this banter toward England, but banter would mean the exchange of teasing remarks. However, since the U.S. didn’t even qualify (yes, we’re still mad) over the likes of No. 53 Panama, we’ll just sit back and practice our cockney accents. Good luck to our friends from across the pond.</p>\n<p><strong>Group H: Poland, Colombia, Senegal, Japan</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Most Balanced of All</em></p>\n<p>Now that we’ve gotten the entertainment factor out in this article, it’s time to return to a very balanced and wholesome drawn group analysis. This might very well be the most wide open group out of all the competitors, and it might very well be the only group in which the first pot selection doesn’t advance. Japan is the lowest ranked here at 56th overall; however, Poland, Colombia and Senegal are all well within range of each other in the FIFA rankings. Therefore, don’t be surprised when any of these teams top their group.<br>\nIt’s still way too early to accurately and efficiently predict who will succeed come this next FIFA World Cup. Still, we’ll make the educated guess of having Brazil and Germany as the two favorites of the entire tourney. Stay tuned as more updates will come as the greatest stage in world football nears its arrival.<br>\nTo recap, here are the results of the drawing once again as well as our early Top-2 picks in asterisks:</p>\n<p><strong>Group A: *Russia, *Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group B: *Portugal, *Spain, Iran, Morocco</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group C: *France, *Peru, Denmark, Australia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group D: *Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, *Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group E: *Brazil, Switzerland, *Costa Rica, Serbia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group F: *Germany, *Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group G: *Belgium, *England, Tunisia, Panama</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group H: Poland, *Colombia, *Senegal, Japan</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80608\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80608\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/","id":3383,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3382,3381,3380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Joint Effort: Cannabis Club Hopes To Build a Community, Educate Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cannaclub-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cannaclub-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Cannaclub covers a broad spectrum of the cannabis world and opens the door for students interested in an industry that is oftentimes tricky to access while in college. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s green, expensive and grows plentiful on Santa Barbara farms.

Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is. I want people of all different majors. It doesn’t matter who you are or whatever you’re interested in,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a place for you.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3</em><em> of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
