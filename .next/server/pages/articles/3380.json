id=\"caption-attachment-92438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves. Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was founded by Kavitta Ghai ‘19 and Jordan Long, a third-year environmental science major who took a year off to launch the start-up to provide UCSB students with an alternative to Slack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack is an instant messaging platform generally used by large organizations for communication on the business level. Nectir, on the other hand, is a system based entirely on improving communication at the academic level between students and instructors. Nectir is actively being built into the GauchoSpace program as an add-on, giving teachers and students the option to use it in their class as a tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ghai, Slack is “a communication platform that’s made for enterprise,” meaning it is structured to support business at a corporate level, whereas the two envisioned Nectir as a structure for communication in an academic environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While the idea of Slack is great, there are a lot of problems that make it unusable at schools. They don’t have data privacy for students … [and] it’s insanely expensive,” Ghai noted, adding that there are “a lot of technical problems” with Slack.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Ghai and Long spent two years developing an alternative: Nectir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last two years, the team has met with university administrators, professors, teaching assistants and students. The purpose of these meetings was to understand what problems these people are seeing and facing every day on campus at a communicative level — allowing the team to create real solutions to real problems, Ghai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first classes at UCSB to use the Nectir program was a workshop class in the Instructional Development department led by one of their instructional consultants, Mindy Colin. By adapting her class to the program, Ghai and Long were given the opportunity to see how Nectir would function in reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir was designed specifically to create lines of communication throughout an entire school, not just for one class or within one major. In order for students to use the program, professors must create a channel for their class — similar to those in Slack — that will be embedded in their class GauchoSpace site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program had its soft launch in Fall Quarter 2019 and since then, Ghai and Long said that 15% of the people at UCSB have used or currently have access to a Nectir channel for a specific class. It is working so well that, according to Ghai, the team is in the process of signing a contract with the school for funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s goal is that “every single student on campus should have Nectir regardless of whether their TA or professor decides to use it,” Ghai said, by Spring Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose behind Nectir is to solve this “position of frustration” that students feel when they transition from a 30-person class in high school to a 500-person college course, Long explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes days to figure out things, and you’re often alone in the library banging your head against the wall trying to figure something out,” Long said. “We don’t know how to fix it, we don’t know how to create a new educational system… but what we can do is use technology to connect people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghai added that a bonus of the program is that it was created by students for students, as opposed to being created by tech companies who create academic tools without factoring in student perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual set-up of the Nectir program was designed in-house; Long manages all of the technical parts in-house and runs the servers himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long and Gh</span>ai have been able to manage a huge portion of the work by bringing their ideas to life themselves, allowing them to move very quickly through the developing process while not needing a significant amount of start-up money.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we’re starting to reach out to other schools, it will eventually be time to bring other people onto the team, but for right now, for everything we have done at UCSB, it has worked really well with just the two of us,” Ghai added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team plans to first completely integrate the system at UCSB before branching out and attempting to spread the program to other schools, such as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and other UC campuses.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [2/03/2020, 7:49 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jordan Long is a second-year student.

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The idea of Quokka Brew was initially ridiculed but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining. <em>Courtesy of Adam Chohan</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student-run coffee company, known as Quokka Brew, was created at UC Berkeley and is now expanding to other campuses across California. As president of the Quokka Brew Ambassador Program at UCSB, fourth-year chemical engineering major Adam Chohan said he is helping expand the brew to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chohan said he first heard about Quokka Brew from UC Berkeley students Ofek Arush and George Passantino, who realized they needed caffeine during finals week in 2018 but found that the anxious jitters and excessive sugar that come with coffee weren’t worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-founders then formulated the idea for an ideal brew that would be an effective energizer and healthier alternative to traditional brews. They soon after consulted with chemists and food scientists in the Bay Area to craft this into a reality, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five months later, Quokka Brew was being distributed in 4-ounce glass bottles around the Berkeley and San Francisco area — marked with a beaming quokka, a small marsupial similar in size to a cat. Containing 15 calories, 1 gram of sugar and almond milk, Quokka Brew is currently the healthiest non-black coffee on the market, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chohan, the science surrounding Quokka Brew’s effectiveness revolves around the circulatory system, where some coffee drinkers experience caffeine’s infamous jitters.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Caffeine normally restricts your veins, so less blood pumping through the circulatory system causes the heart to start pumping harder and counteract that, which is where the jitters and anxiety arise from,” Chohan explained. “The amino acids in [the Quokka] blend act as vasodilators which dilate the veins so blood flows through the circulatory system with the same caffeine intake.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of Quokka Brew — to provide the benefits of caffeine without its negative side effects — was initially ridiculed as an impossible feat but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining, Chohan said. The brew is sold in 10 stores across the Bay Area and is backed by a team of 46 students at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the company transitions into its second year of production, it continues to expand to college campuses across the state, including Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Sacramento State and now UCSB. Across each campus, the company tables, creates ambassador programs and works to get the product sold in nearby stores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps we are taking here are very similar to the steps that UC Berkeley took but they are happening a lot quicker because the response has been really awesome. I think mostly it is because people are very friendly here and students are eager to support student-run business models,” Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While popularity grows on campus, the company is looking forward to making some pivotal adjustments including using a fair-trade coffee roaster and transitioning to aluminum cans. The brew is currently only available at Sam’s To Go in I.V., but Chohan said they hope to soon sell Quokka Brew at the UCen, the Arbor and the Corner Store on campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buildings that have now fallen below UC standards are in a level VI category, which is labeled by the UCSB Design, Facilities &amp; Safety Services website as a high priority for correction. These buildings are the Chemistry and Biochemistry Building, Ellison Hall, Music Building, Phelps Hall, San Miguel Towers and San Nicolas Towers, according to the campus-wide email sent out by Garry Mac Pherson, vice chancellor for administrative administrative services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, 99 campus buildings or portions of those buildings have a rating of V, meaning they will require a “second, more thorough evaluation, and any confirmed seismic deficiencies will be addressed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Mac Pherson’s email, engineers have been reevaluating the UCSB campus since 2018 based on new guidelines. The retrofitting and upgrading of buildings is expected to be completed by 2030, according to the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As new science and technology become available, building codes are modified to incorporate advances in best practices and continually enhance building safety,” Mac Pherson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the 1970s, the University of California has been a leader both in seismic-structure research and in developing seismic policies and standards to address the risks that earthquakes pose,” Mac Pherson said in the email. “UC has set its standards for seismic safety higher than those associated with state and local building codes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with the extra precautions taken by the University of California, earthquakes still pose a risk. According to the California Earthquake Authority, there is a </span><a href=\"https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/California-Earthquake-Risk/Faults-By-County?c=santa-barbara\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% chance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of at least one earthquake occurring in Southern California with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus will begin undergoing building upgrades in summer 2021, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Campus leadership is actively working on developing the schedule and sequencing of our seismic retrofit program to align with UC seismic safety policy. Currently for our housing facilities, the goal is to schedule the seismic retrofit projects over the summer months, when they are least likely to impact our student residents and occupancy rates,” Estrada said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plans for the upgrades are not yet complete, so it is not known what aspects of UCSB life will be affected yet. Estrada also expressed that it is unclear what will need to be repaired in order to maintain the high building rating.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/","id":3379,"author":{"id":261,"name":"Megan Ramsey"},"related":[3378,3377,3376],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
