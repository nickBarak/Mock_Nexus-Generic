More easily forgotten by the hordes of transient students departing UCSB after a few years are the names, faces and duties of the hundreds of administrators who log their hours on campus for the sake of the university’s academic mission.</p>\n<p>That’s right — considering that most students only spend four years here, five tops — undergraduates are really just little fish in a large sea.</p>\n<p>What follows is a spotlight of the biggest fish on campus. Pay attention — most of these school officials have been working here since before the 2011 graduating class was born.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26799\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2050692356\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26799\" data-attachment-id=\"26799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/yang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1129889590\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"yang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yang-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"yang\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26799\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Henry T. Yang</p></div></span><strong>Henry T. Yang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A former dean of engineering and distinguished professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University, Chancellor Henry T. Yang is — quite literally — a rocket scientist.</p>\n<p>Since joining UCSB in 1994 as both chancellor and a professor of mechanical engineering, Yang has seen the university weather a heavy storm. While economic recession has made marks worldwide, its effects have been particularly brutal on state education.</p>\n<p>Despite substantial efforts to combat the devastating budget cuts, Yang said the end of the UC’s fiscal maelstrom is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>“Our challenge this year is to sustain the remarkable momentum of our progress while continuing to absorb the state budget cuts,” Yang said in an e-mail. “Despite these budget challenges, we remain absolutely unwavering in our commitment to providing our students with the quality education they deserve. After all, our students are the reason we are here.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of his most challenging tasks is communicating effectively with groups such as the UC Office of the President, alumni, donors, community members and representatives in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., to make sure that his decisions are well-informed and well-received.</p>\n<p>“It is important for all voices to be heard so that each person becomes a true partner in the process,” Yang said. “I think that’s what makes UC Santa Barbara so special — we are not just a university, we are also a community.”</p>\n<p>Yang is also well-known for demonstrating his commitment to the heart of the university: its student body. While some high-level administrators struggle to schedule time to spend with their student body, Yang said he thrives on it.</p>\n<p>“My wife, Dilling, and I are privileged to live on campus, near our residence halls and dining commons,” he said. “One of the most enjoyable parts of our daily campus life is getting to know our students — sharing dinner at the dining commons, cheering at student performances and athletic events, talking with students during our regular walks around campus and Isla Vista and working with our students on campus issues.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26804\" style=\"width: 191px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"903102166\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26804\" data-attachment-id=\"26804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/gene-lucas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"gene lucas\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Glenn (Gene) Lucas&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gene-lucas-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"gene lucas\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-26804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn (Gene) Lucas</p></div></span><strong>Glenn (“Gene”) Lucas</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Executive Vice Chancellor</strong></p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus himself, Gene Lucas went on to earn a Sc.D. degree at MIT before returning to UCSB in 1978 to teach at the College of Engineering.

His responsibilities — in consultation with the Santa Barbara Division of the Academic Senate — include overseeing academic planning and programming, developing and implementing academic policy as well as monitoring the academic personnel process.

In between then and now, the credit for the striking physical appearance of today’s university goes to the likes of Marc Fisher and his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Fisher oversees Design and Construction Services, Campus Planning and Design, Housing and Residential Services and Physical Facilities, just to name a few. As a licensed architect with a Master’s degree in the field, Fisher is the man with the plan — actually, quite a few of them. Over the last eight years, he and his colleagues have developed the 2010 Long Range Development Plan, Campus Plan, Campus Housing Study, Campus Sustainability Plan and Physical Design Framework.</p>\n<p>Fisher said he looks forward to seeing the extensive work turn into tangible — not to mention environmentally-friendly — results.</p>\n<p>“This is an exciting time for our campus,” Fisher said in an e-mail. “It will be a campus that takes full advantage of our physical setting, is rich in texture and yet orderly in form, with many new housing options for our students, faculty and staff. It will be a campus that relies more heavily upon bicycle and pedestrian circulation and will continue to push into new areas of sustainability.”</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing him to utilize his passion for architecture, Fisher said his role at the university has given him the opportunity to join a tight-knit community.</p>\n<p>“My job entails so much variety — it is truly never dull,” he said. “I get to work with great people and have direct access to a cross section of our campus community — students, faculty and staff — as well as our local community.  Along with all of that, we are building and serving a campus environment commensurate with the academic excellence of this university.”</p>\n<p><span></span><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1634231109\" data-slb-group=\"26796\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26800\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/young/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"566,779\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"young\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Michael Young&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=182%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young.jpg?fit=566%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/young-181x250.jpg?resize=181%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"young\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-26800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><strong>Michael Young</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</strong></p>\n<p>As UCSB students, we know that a university is defined by more than what goes on inside its classrooms. It would be safe to say that Michael Young is responsible for almost everything else.</p>\n<p>As the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Young oversees more than 20 departments, including admissions, counseling, Student Health and the MultiCultural Center. After 20 years on the job, Young said his favorite part has always been — and will continue to be — his connection with the student body.</p>\n<p>“I know this will sound corny, but I really love working with UCSB students,” Young said. “I feel that I lucked out and ended up in a great career, in a great place for students. I’ve also had some extraordinary colleagues here in Santa Barbara and it’s been an absolute joy working with these professionals, trying to do our best to serve students here.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student body is a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>“At times in my job, I have a responsibility for either life-or-death matters relative to students or I have to become involved in situations where the academic careers of certain students are at risk,” Young said. “I’ve found that, even after all these years — and I’m glad of this — it has not come easy. It’s pretty sobering. Every time I am engaged in one of those situations, I am reminded that each and every student is an individual with a life and with a family, with dreams and hopes.”</p>\n<p>Although the Division of Student Affairs has been suffering at least $1 million of cutbacks a year for the past seven consecutive years, Young said he is determined to shield students from the repercussions.</p>\n<p>“[My goal] is to find out the impacts and the implications of the budget situation and then respond to that so that we can find ways to live within our new financial realities and continue to provide high-quality services to students,” Young said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/campus/","id":3498,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3497,3496,3495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman","biography":"Not available","articles":[3126,3147,3155,3498],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Legacy of Thomas M.

After graduating at the age of 22, he returned to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Although he had no prior experience in journalism, Storke quickly became involved in the newspaper business. He started out as a cub reporter, feeling his way through the business, but became a newspaper owner within a few short years.</p>\n<p>“In 1900, Tom Storke, aged 24, borrowed $2,000 to buy the Daily Independent, weakest of the town’s three papers,” an October 13, 1971 New York Times article reads. “He sold it in 1909 and went back into the business in 1913 as owner of the Santa Barbara Daily News. Not long afterward he reacquired the Independent and published the combined paper as the Daily News and Independent.”</p>\n<p>In 1932, Storke took yet another paper under his wing.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Storke, editor and publisher of the Santa Barbara  Daily News, faced a dilemma that seems positively alien in 2004,” Matt Welch wrote in a Reason.com article. “Storke’s competition, the 58-year-old Santa Barbara Morning Press, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and it begged him to take over as owner.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the Santa Barbara News-Press was born.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Storke of All Trades</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to journalism, Storke pursued work  in a variety of other fields. In 1938, he stepped up  in the place of Senator William Gibbs McAddoo  and served as a California senator for two months.  He founded the AM radio station KTMS, was a  member of the California Crime Commission from  1951 to 1952 and served as a University of California  regent from 1955 to 1960. He wrote two autobiographies, including California Editor.</p>\n<p>Storke was also instrumental in establishing  the Santa Barbara Airport, the man-made Lake  Cachuma and UC Santa Barbara. Under the college  land grant program, Storke used his political ties to  secure 900 coastal acres of the land UCSB stands on  today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>California Editor</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1961, Storke published a series of exposés identifying the John Birch Society — founded in the late  1950s and still active today as right-wing political  advocacy group — as a totalitarian organization.</p>\n<p>“My grandfather was basically a very kind and  gentle man,” Thomas Storke Cox, Storke’s grandson,  said in an e-mail. “However, he did not suffer fools  gladly and  he could only be pushed so far  before  striking back. That is what happened in the case of  the John Birch Society. … Once the Birchers went  after his close friend … he decided to return the favor  and go after them.”</p>\n<p>According to a May 23, 2011 Santa Barbara  Independent article by Michael Redmon, the Society  started out with only 11 members during the Cold  War but, by the early 1960s, had a membership of  nearly 100,000.</p>\n<p>“The primary purpose of the organization in this  period was to expose and root out what members  perceived to be the pervasive and dangerous influences of communism in all aspects of American life,”  the article reads.</p>\n<p>Among those under attack by the Society were  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Storke’s  good friend and former Supreme Court Chief of  Justice Earl Warren, for whom the Earl Warren  Showgrounds are named.</p>\n<p>In response, the Santa Barbara News-Press  slammed the Society for its divisive attacks on  notable — and, in Storke’s opinion, undeserving —  political leaders.</p>\n<p>“During recent weeks, the News-Press has  sought to enlighten its readers about a semi-secret organization called the John Birch Society,” one of the editorials reads. “The News-Press condemns the destructive campaign of hate and vilification that the John Birch Society is waging against national leaders who deserve our respect and confidence. How can anyone follow a leader absurd enough to call former President Eisenhower ‘a dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy’?”</p>\n<p>In 1962, Storke was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in addition to the Lauterbach Award by the Nieman Foundation of Harvard and the Elijah Lovejoy Fellowship for courageous journalism.</p>\n<p>Newspapers were one of Storke’s great life passions and though he sold the NewsPress in 1964, Storke remained editor and publisher emeritus.</p>\n<p>In a speech at the Annual Dinner Meeting of the California Press Association, Storke said, “I still say that the first responsibility of editors and publishers is to their own community. But, when the job is done well, its byproducts can become greater than the first objective.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“These bells ring for freedom…”</strong></p>\n<p>In 1969, Storke spoke at the official dedication for his namesake, Storke Tower, which he helped fund.</p>\n<p>“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world,” Storke said. “Talented students are here. Brilliant faculty members are here. Working together, they can produce publications of national and international scope — for the enlightenment of civilized people everywhere.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus student newspaper, La Cumbre yearbook and KCSB radio station have worked out of the offices under the tower for years.</p>\n<p>The building’s original pamphlet notes that the landmark soars 175 feet above the campus’ main-level and is the tallest structure in the entire county. Within the tower lies a 61-bell carillon, the only five-octave chromatic bell system in existence.</p>\n<p>On October 12 of 1971, just two years after the Storke Tower dedication, Thomas More Storke died after suffering a stroke.  He was 94 years old.</p>\n<p>Storke was survived by 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. The Davidson Library’s Special Collections alone has over 200 condolence letters, cards and telegrams sent to his widow within two weeks after his passing.</p>\n<p>According to Cox, few of today’s journalists exhibit the same fearlessness as his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“The whole concept of an ‘independent journalist’ à la my grandfather has become almost an anachronism in these days of the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc.,” he said. “Even the concept of an ‘independent newspaper’ has become almost quaint since the way things are now going there may not be a lot of ‘newspapers’ left in the future, let alone ones whose editorial policies are set by one dedicated individual as was the case of the Santa Barbara NewsPress fifty years ago.”</p>\n<p>Storke’s memory is alive in the bells that chime every hour on the hour. As a placard on Storke Tower reads, “These bells ring for the freedom of the press and in tribute to Editor-Publisher Thomas More Storke, whose affection for the University made this building possible.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-31/legacy-thomas-storke/","id":3495,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3494,3493,3492],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: The League of Extraordinary Quarterbacks","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"[media-credit name=”Ian Sander” align=”alignleft” width=”250″][/media-credit]Lloyd Christmas: “I’m ready for commitment, Harry!

There has been some killer games and moments, plenty of action and surprises, as well as record-breaking performances.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the league’s quarterbacks — and some of their unstoppable offenses — have emphatically stolen the show through three games this season, carnivorously feasting on opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>In week one alone, Tom Brady and Chad Henne combined for 906 passing yards, an NFL single-game record, and quarterbacks combined for 7,842 yards, more than in any other week in NFL history. Even more astounding, 14 quarterbacks passed for 300 or more yards more than in any week, and there were five games, the most in history, with two 300-yard passers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, an unbelievable five QBs are on pace to break Dan Marino’s single season passing record of 5,084 yards. Matthew Stafford, who has his popular breakout candidate Detroit Lions at 3-0 for the first time in 31 years, is on pace to throw for 5,210 yards. Philip Rivers is on pace for 5,221. Rookie of the Year Cam Newton (can we just give him the trophy now?) is on pace for 5,397. Drew Brees is on pace for 5,648, and finally, his royalty — coming in at 34 years of age, standing at 6’4”, weighing in 225 lbs., with long, blonde flowing locks, a beautiful wife, and sporting UGG shoes — is Tom Brady, who, after passing for 940 for two games, 1,327 for three yards through three games, is on pace to throw for a godly 7,077 yards on the season.</p>\n<p>Those on the receiving end of this plethora of passing yards are also on their way to breaking records. Wes Welker, after last week’s insane line of 16 grabs for 217 yards and 2 TDs against the Bills, is one pace to grab 165 catches for 2,443 yards on the season — both would be NFL records. Additionally, Pittsburgh’s Mike Wallace and Carolina’s Steve Smith are on pace to beat Jerry Rice’s single season record of 1,848 receiving yards.</p>\n<p>Okay, okay. Calm down. I know, I know. It has only been three weeks. I know. Buuut stillllll. Pretty amazing. While it’s far too early to truly extrapolate and expect record-breaking performances, there is something to take away from this.</p>\n<p>The NFL — where traditionally you need to establish the run and feature a stingy defense to succeed — has become a full-blown quarterback league. It has been headed this way for a little while now, but we are now there. You absolutely NEED a star quarterback to compete. I would rather have Tom Brady than the entire Jets defense, because the old mantra of “defense wins championships” no longer holds true. You NEED an offense capable of scoring 30 points, and that starts with a star QB.</p>\n<p>It could be that new rule changes are protecting quarterbacks and wide receivers more than ever, and that, without pressure, the great quarterbacks of the league are able to pick apart secondaries like never before. Defenses are being effectively hindered by an increasing amount of restrictive rules. Also, offenses — with no-huddle sets and innovative formations starring empty backfields, three wide receiver sets, and pass-catching running backs and tight ends  — have become so evolved, and defenses have yet to catch up. The great quarterbacks are winning the chess battle, allowing their teams to effectively take advantage of the mismatches they create.</p>\n<p>The truly surprising part of this is that it is happening so early in the year. I mean, I thought that because of the lockout, offenses were supposed to struggle to find a rhythm and get in sync, and low scoring defensive affairs were sure to happen. Not so much. I mean, Brady came just 13 yards short of becoming the first QB to pass for 400 yards in three consecutive games. EVER. And he did it in the first three weeks, and after a lockout shortened off-season because it is an adjective training camp.</p>\n<p>Could it be that defenses — in particular secondaries — are the units that are out of sync? There has been an abundance of blown coverages and pass interference penalties. It does make sense that the missed training camp time would hurt defenses more; a secondary unit relies more on the unity and cohesiveness of the group more than an offense. Rather than running routes with set assignments as an offense does, a defense must not only adapt to the offense, but also to each other.</p>\n<p>Either way, the NFL does love these high-scoring affairs, as should you. So sit back, and enjoy them; unless of course you are inexcusably stuck watching a brutal 49ers/Bengals game (AKA the largest pillow fight in NFL football history).
