UC Davis regained its second place standing in the conference as a result of UCSB’s loss and with a 75-57 victory over Cal Poly. The Aggies will host Santa Barbara with records of 11-7 and 4-1 in Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Prior to the start of conference play, the Gauchos’ identity as a team was a questionable matter heading into the conference portion of the season.</p>\n<p>However, through six Big West games, UCSB’s identity continues to gradually build around its improvements on offense. Santa Barbara has nearly improved in every statistical category since the beginning of conference play. UCSB currently ranks third in the conference in field goal percentage at 45.8, fourth in points per game with an average of 68.0 and fifth in three-point percentage at 35.5.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara has improved offensively, its prowess on defense has turned into a source of scoring as the Gauchos’ average of 9.2 steals per game ranks second in the Big West. As UCSB has forced opponents to turn the ball over, it has influenced the flow of ball movement in UCSB’s offense and will be a vital asset in the Gauchos containing the Aggies.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes you just think execution is on the offensive end, but it’s on the defensive end as well,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Their [UC Davis] guards will try to post us because we’re a lot smaller. For us to try to pressure the post on a pass will be important for us.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB averages 16.0 assists per game, ranking third in the Big West. Leading UCSB’s passing attack has been junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She ranks second in assists per game, nearly doubling her average since the start of conference play improving from 3.9 to 6.7 per contest. She posted a career-high 10 assists in the first meeting versus the Aggies as she dished dimes to teammates like sophomore guard Makala Roper who scored a game-high 26 points in the victory.</p>\n<p>“As a point guard, you’re always kind of held at a different level and Coach Bonnie has made that clear,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s been pushing me and every time she pushes me I get better. My teammates help me of course, without them knocking down the shots, I don’t get the assists.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s defense has been a disruption in the passing lanes for opponents, the Gauchos’ quick hands will not always make up for their size disadvantage. It is a drawback that has affected their performance when rebounding the ball, landing UCSB with a conference low average of 30.3 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Although Davis grabbed just seven more rebounds than UCSB in the first meeting, outrebounding the Gauchos 40-33, the Aggies’ ability to rebound the ball is essential to capitalizing on their size.</p>\n<p>Davis’ length provides a versatile element which goes beyond it being a threat in the paint. It is also the reason the Aggies have been such a lethal team when shooting the ball from beyond the arc in being able to rebound the ball and make the passes to set up perimeter shots.</p>\n<p>Their 39.5 three-point field goal percentage leads the Big West as senior forward Celia Marfone and sophomore forward Pele Gianotti are the Aggies’ top sharpshooters from long range. Both rank in the top five of the conference in three-point field goal percentage with Marfone owning a Big West leading 49 percent and Gianotti in second at 40.7 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gianotti registered her first career double-double in Davis’ loss to UCSB, tallying 19 points and 10 rebounds. Her dual-threat ability to shoot from behind the perimeter and score in the post in the ideal complement to redshirt freshman forward Morgan Bertsch.</p>\n<p>Bertsch is the Aggies’ leading scorer averaging 13.1 ppg in addition to her conference leading 58.1 field goal percentage which ranks 12<sup>th</sup> in the nation. As a team, Davis holds national rankings in field goal percentage (43.9 percent) and field goal percentage defense (36.3 percent), ranking 41<sup>st</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> in the country along with ranking second in the conference in both statistical categories, respectively.</p>\n<p>UCD held UCSB to just seven points in the first quarter of last week’s contest. Yet, both teams registered first half field goal percentages below 30 percent in the initial meeting.</p>\n<p>“We always say don’t have amnesia,” Henrickson said. “The rules on offense are: drive it, shoot it, but don’t hold it. When things work, keep doing it and when things don’t work, quit doing it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tipoff at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 30 in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-basketball-preview/","id":363,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[362,361,360],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Cold Shooting Start Allows UCD to Prevail for 80-51 Rout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-8-of-13-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-12 shooting performance in the first quarter by the UCSB women's basketball team resulted in the Gauchos falling behind 22-8 and eventually ended in a 80-51 victory for UC Davis as the Aggies shot...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While the UCSB women’s basketball team managed to defeat UC Davis 66-59 last Thursday despite a 12.5 field goal percentage in the first quarter, the Gauchos’ 3-12 shooting performance in the first period of Saturday’s contest resulted in them being outscored 22-8.

Completing the Aggies’ consistent shooting performance was their success from behind the three-point line, finishing 9-17 from long range.</p>\n<p>Attempting 10 of Davis’ 17 shots from beyond the arc were two of the Big West’s top three-point shooters in forwards senior Pele Gianotti and sophomore Celia Marfone.</p>\n<p>After earning her first career double-double against the Gauchos earlier this season, Gianotti provided another solid performance tallying a game-high 18 points on 7-10 shooting from the field, 4-7 from three-point range in addition to five rebounds, three assists and three steals. Marfone finished with 17 points on 7-12 shooting while going 2-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Supporting Davis’ assertive scoring start was its effort on defense as it held the Gauchos to eight points in the first quarter, nearly repeating its allowance of seven points to UCSB in the first period of last Thursday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ off shooting performance affected their leading scorer in sophomore guard Makala Roper as she went 4-14 from the field to conclude Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds and five assists. Yet, providing UCSB with scoring was backcourt leader Onome Jemerigbe. After a career-high 16 points at UC Riverside, the junior point guard followed up with a team-high 15 points as the Gauchos attempted to overcome their out of sync shooting.</p>\n<p>But, the Aggies sustained their lead with Marfone at the forefront of their 24-12 outscoring of UCSB in the second quarter. Her 12-point scoring outburst in the quarter helped guide UCD to its 46-20 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s shooting slump was most evident from the insufficient 14 minutes of play that senior guard Jasmine Ware displayed while on the court. After a career-high 23 points at UCR, her nine-game streak of double-figures in points came to an end as she went scoreless on a 0-3 overall and 0-2 three-point shooting effort while committing four turnovers, adding to the Gauchos’ total of 17.</p>\n<p>There was a more even exchange of points in the second half as the Aggies narrowly outscored UCSB 34-31 in the final two quarters. Still, it wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB shot over 40 percent from the field (42.9 percent) but could not supersede the Aggies’ 50 percent shooting in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara’s best shooting stretch occurred in the fourth quarter, the Gauchos already faced a 18-point deficit entering the period and were eventually defeated 80-51.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return home to face Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday and Hawaii on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since then, the losing woes have continued for Fullerton as it is 2-19 overall, 0-7 in the Big West and recently matched its school single-season record of 19 consecutive losses in a 79-52 loss at CSUN.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are not in the predicament of a must-win game this Wednesday, it is a matchup that could help them regain some momentum entering the middle portion of their conference schedule.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off its worst field goal percentage (31.1 percent) and lowest point total (51) in a conference game this season, it can be assured that UCSB is looking to recoup on the offensive end of the court.</p>\n<p>Prior to its recent losses, the Gauchos were on a three-game winning streak, shooting 43 percent from the field and averaged 65.3 points per game. While these aren’t groundbreaking statistics, UCSB’s decrease in turnovers helped it to establish a rhythmic flow on offense. It had recorded less turnovers than its opponents on three-straight occasions.</p>\n<p>Yet, a slow upward trend in turnovers has affected the Gauchos in their two losses. UCSB hadn’t registered over 14 turnovers since its first meeting at UCR, ending this streak with 16 at UCR and 17 at UCD.</p>\n<p>The rise in turnovers can be viewed as a warning signal for a team that once averaged 20 turnovers per game during its non-conference schedule. While the Gauchos have improved in their protection of the ball since the start of Big West play, UCSB’s battle with turnovers begins in its backcourt.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore guard Makala Roper both rank top 10 in the Big West in turnovers per game with overall averages of 3.3 and 4.2. However, the Gauchos’ average of 15.1 assists per game ranks third in the Big West in addition to them being second in steals per game with 8.9 per contest.</p>\n<p>In spite of the turnovers, Roper has been the driving force for the Gauchos’ scoring this season as she leads UCSB with a 12.5 points per game average. She also holds a fifth place ranking in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.3 percent while her total of 41 three-pointers made this season is just five away from the conference lead. Freshman Coco Miller is just seven threes away from the conference lead of 46 with a total of 39 made perimeter shots on the year.</p>\n<p>Not known much as a scorer but rather as a floor general for the Gauchos’ offense, Jemerigbe has emerged with back-to-back games of double-figures in points despite the team’s pair of losses. She notched a career-high 16 points at UCR and had 15 points in the team’s loss at UCD.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage in its first matchup against the Titans. It was the Gauchos’ defense that influenced their offense as they scored 20 points off 15 Fullerton turnovers.</p>\n<p>CSUF will be hoping for an improved performance by forward Michelle Berry after a 6-23 shooting night in the team’s first game against the Gauchos. Though the first-year player concluded the game with a double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds, Berry was responsible for seven of the Titans’ turnovers.</p>\n<p>The latest addition of junior center Dhanyel Johnson to its starting lineup may help reduce the team’s dependence on Berry for the remainder of the season. After a zero-point outing in 15 minutes of play in her first start of the season at Hawaii, Johnson took advantage of her 37 minutes this past Saturday at CSUN achieving her first career double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Junior center Je Zhe Newton scored a season-high 15 points in the Gauchos’ first bout against Fullerton, but had missed the last two of UCSB’s three games recently making a return at UCD in which she recorded seven points and five rebounds in 16 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton is set for Wednesday, Feb. 3 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/ucsb-seeking-to-restore-offensive-edge-host-csuf-wednesday/","id":365,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[364,363,362],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
