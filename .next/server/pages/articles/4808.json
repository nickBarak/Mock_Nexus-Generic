During the march, over 100 demonstrators walked from Little Acorn Park to Del Playa, then proceeded to walk up and down Del Playa chanting “End rape culture!” and “Consent is an enthusiastic yes!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment. – Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund said Bhavnani, who is also Chair of the Academic Senate, prompted her students to organize an event that addressed what they felt were the most prevalent issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Immediately, rape culture surfaced as the biggest issue for all of us. Professor Bhavnani prompted us a little and we decided to do something about it,” said Westerlund. “The rest is history.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger, event participants felt that Friday’s demonstration was vital in order to bring attention to what many students see as an increase of sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was rewarding to be able to say publicly that there are actually people who care about this problem [and] so many people who know it’s unacceptable,” Ballinger said. “In a community where rape happens all the time, we don’t get a chances to say that enough.”</p>\n<p>Westerlund said the event helped shed light on issues regarding safety for women in I.V. and that turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations by amassing twice predicted amount of attendees.</p>\n<p>“I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment,” Westerlund said. “The fact that this happens in Isla Vista makes this event really relevant to our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59842\" data-attachment-id=\"59842\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59842 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Participants walked the one-mile stretch while holding posters and passing out flyers that read “No excuse for rape. End rape culture.” According to Westerlund, event organizers intentionally staged the march on Del Playa in order to bring attention to sexual assault in an area that has historically typified what many students see as the party culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We planned the walk for DP on a Friday night in order to reach the target audience,” Westerlund said. “DP is always filled with students, often intoxicated, looking or headed towards a party. This group is especially at risk of rape, sexual assault or harassment. We wanted to bring the problem to light in its own arena.”</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, many students and I.V. residents cheered and clapped from their Del Playa balconies, high-fived participants or took videos of the passing crowd.</p>\n<p>Organizers invited students to participate in the demonstration via Facebook in order to facilitate discussion on rape culture in I.V., third-year sociology major and event coordinator Zoe Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>“This is an interactive event to help make known that there does exist in Isla Vista a rape culture and this we hope will provide a space where students can comfortably confront rape culture,” Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.]. To end the, ‘Well what was she wearing?’ and ‘Was she drunk?’ questions, and to end the society that makes these questions okay. – Third-year global studies major Claire Breen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Patrice Trowbridge said gender roles in I.V. play a large part in shaping the presence of rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“To me rape culture is every person that feels entitled to sex and every person that feels obligated to give it. And that’s so pervasive in I.V. The way we look at gender leads to rape but people don’t see that,” Trowbridge said. “Hopefully if we make it hard to ignore it will start some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Jonathan Gonzalez, a fourth-year political science major and Vice President of Sigma Lambda Beta fraternity’s local chapter, rape is just as much a male issue as it is a female issue and should be addressed equally by both sexes.</p>\n<p>“Instead of teaching girls to be careful and to watch their backs, we should be teaching the boys to not rape. Our current generation is the next generation of parents so it’s up to us to get educated and educate our boys and girls,” said Gonzalez. “Boys and girls were stopping their normal weekend partying to cheer and chant with us.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity member Carlos Maldonado said rape culture is a topic that needs to be given immediate attention, especially within organizations that face controversy regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a fraternity member, it is essential to be present at these important events so that we may raise awareness and establish accountability within our own organizations so that we do not perpetuate this culture,” said Maldonado.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59843\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59843\" data-attachment-id=\"59843\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59843\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=253%2C168\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major Claire Breen, event attendees marched in order to empower others to participate in the local and nationwide movement toward ending rape culture.</p>\n<p>“I think that rape culture is horrifically prevalent not only in Isla Vista, but on all college campuses in the United States,” said Breen. “I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.].

Parking costs at the lot were expected to bring in about $10,000 a year, with the funds being used to repair broken fences and restore bathrooms at Anisq’Oyo’ Park. While skaters were able to persuade trustees to keep the lot open, board members are still debating the construction of a skate park due to budgetary constraints.</p>\n<p>At the helm of the movement to salvage the land for a permanent skate park is the two-year-old Goleta Skateboard Movement (GSM). According to GSM co-president Elliott Rebuck, GSM’s three main objectives are advocacy for the skateboarding community, education and outreach and supporting and constructing skate spots.</p>\n<p>Despite being around for only two years, the GSM is comprised of volunteers who all collaborate to work toward an enhancement of the Goleta Valley skateboarding heritage through recreational opportunities offered to the community and its youth, according to Rebuck.</p>\n<p>“The volunteers are lifelong skaters who first got involved with skate park advocacy, design and construction well over a decade ago,” Rebuck said.</p>\n<p>Rebuck said city officials do not often take into account the community’s significant demand for a skate park and oftentimes overlook the health, safety and economic advantages a successful skate park can have. For example, the park can act as a community gathering center, attract tourists, promote healthy and active lifestyles and maintain skater safety by providing a smooth space to train instead of forcing skaters to practice over irregular surfaces.</p>\n<p>“Once a skate park is constructed, it will provide a low-cost recreational alternative to organized sports, encourage athleticism, fitness and confidence-building amongst its users, while simultaneously breaking down barriers of race, gender, age, religion, economic status or language spoken,” Rebuck said.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, a skate park would be a good addition to Isla Vista for its socio-cultural benefits similar to those described by Rebuck. However, Gould said such benefits would only apply if the skate park is kept safe, well-maintained and drug- and alcohol-free.</p>\n<p>“It’s an activity that crosses all age, economic and racial barriers,” Gould said. “I see it as a way to narrow cultural divides and open doors to interaction and understanding between the different factions of the community.”</p>\n<p>Gould said making progress on implementing a skate park and other types of projects may oftentimes be difficult due to the short-term length of the Parks and Recreation District positions.</p>\n<p>“One of the major challenges for the District has been the turnover of board members and management,” Gould said. “If you include short-term interim GMs, I am the thirteenth General Manager in as many years. Board members also tend to come and go quickly, largely due to graduating students. With the rapid turnover, it’s hard to keep momentum going.”</p>\n<p>However, the most daunting problem facing the completion of a skate park is funding, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>“The District operates on a fixed income that gets only a small adjustment annually,” Gould said. “The adjustment is only enough to cover daily operations and doesn’t leave money for major capital projects … The last thing we want is an awesome skate park that falls into disrepair due to lack of money.”</p>\n<p>Rebuck said while he understands the pressure within money constraints, he feels that more grassroots organizing efforts are necessary in order to convince the city of a skate park’s importance.</p>\n<p>“So far the community hasn’t made building one a priority,” Rebuck said. “Our next step is to recruit more advocates within Isla Vista’s skate community, gain support from non-skateboarding residents and business owners, then collaborate with the IVRPD and city to develop a shared vision that will meet the demand.”</p>\n<p>Currently, the GSM is also working with several other potential skate park spots along the Hollister corridor and is promoting and attending design workshops for these sites.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-07/sk8-or-die-group-makes-headway-on-skate-park/","id":4806,"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr"},"related":[4805,4804,4803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The park is now mid-project, and access to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road remains limited.</p>\n<p>According to Liz Buda, vice chair of the IVRPD, the organization initiated the project late last month.</p>\n<p>“We had our general meeting on February 23, and that was when we decided to spend the money, so [construction began] probably around the end of the month,” Buda said.</p>\n<p>Buda said the organization is funding the project with revenue from state grants for the Anisq’Oyo’ Bridge renovation.</p>\n<p>“Basically our general manager really understands the permit process, so we ended up with more money for projects besides the bridge,” Buda said. “One is to expand the Frisbee golf course to regulation size, as well as [add] some new benches.”</p>\n<p>Buda said the project is scheduled for completion at the end of the month, in compliance with state funding guidelines.</p>\n<p>“The construction will be done at the end of March.
