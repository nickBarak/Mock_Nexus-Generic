Through these trials, favorites emerge and division dynasties are formed. Teams like the Yankees, Braves, Cardinals, Phillies and Rangers are used to looking forward to October as the time when their games really matter.</p>\n<p>However, when that time comes, anything can happen. One injury, one hot streak, one fluky month can change the entire complexion of the MLB postseason. Nine different teams have won the World Series in the last 12 years.  Ten different teams have lost the World Series in that time. The Dodgers, A’s and Indians are in a position to inflate those numbers. And this year, the Pittsburg Pirates are in the playoffs for the first time in my lifetime. The best part: They’re legit.</p>\n<p>In a wild baseball year when there are three single-game elimination rounds before the Division Series even begin, the 2013 World Series title is as open as ever. However, there is a formula for success that can be traced back over the last decade. Pitching wins championships, and this year, a few teams are loaded.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to the numbers, the Dodgers have two of the top five pitchers in baseball. In addition to Co-Aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, L.A. sports two solid number threes in Hyun-jin Ryu and Ricky Nolasco. But the Dodgers are dealing with injuries to star outfielders Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier, causing them to sputter down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Whether L.A. faltered due to injuries, resting their starters or losing their momentum, they better hope their pitchers rebound to the elite level that they were at during the Dodgers’ historic hot streak. If not, St. Louis, Atlanta and Pittsburg are waiting in the wings.</p>\n<p>The Pirates can match the Dodgers’ pitching on any given day, even if they don’t have the payroll and the star power. AJ Burnett is looking like a revelation after being an injured shell of his former self in recent years. Francisco Liriano had the Cy Young season that people have been predicting since he was co-lead of a Minnesota Twins rotation with Johan Santana.</p>\n<p>While they haven’t had the headlines this season, the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves continue their persistent excellence by way of the “next-man-up” philosophy. Longtime Atlanta number one Tim Hudson went down with an injury, but next up is Kris Medlen who takes over the ace mantle after a September in which he went 4-0 with a 1.00 ERA. In year 2 PA [post-Albert], the Cardinals feature two first basemen with .300 averages in Allen Craig and Matt Adams.</p>\n<p>The National League is stacked, but on the American League side of things, the Red Sox, A’s and Rays are playing to prove that they’re for real, again. All three teams have enjoyed sustained success, but the lack of star power causes critics to doubt their legitimacy.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox, who scored more runs than anyone in the game, just won the toughest division in baseball on way to the best record of all 30 teams. Yet they’re not even considered the favorites in the American League, a distinction that belongs to the Tigers, led by Miguel Cabrera. I guess people can’t believe that the Red Sox are for real after trading Adrian Gonzalez and blowing up their team last year. But with Mike Napoli filling the void admirably, David Ortiz having a career year, and the rest of the lineup getting on base and hitting with runners in scoring position, the Red Sox could surprise everyone. Well, everyone who didn’t pay attention to the numbers.</p>\n<p>And for the second year in a row, Oakland surprised everyone and took the AL West. The legend of Josh Donaldson continues in the bay to ease the pain of the Giants fall from grace, and it seems like they have about a dozen quality pitchers waiting in the wings. If Oakland can turn Bartolo Colon into an ace at age 75 and Coco Crisp into a power hitter, I’m sold that the A’s have something supernatural going on.</p>\n<p>But the question remains: can these teams compete with the Tigers? Max Scherzer should win the Cy Young, Miguel Cabrera should be awarded “Best Hitter Of A Generation” distinctions, and Justin Verlander can still throw 101 MPH in the 9th inning of a game in October.</p>\n<p>Underdogs can heat up at any given moment as well. Just ask the Giants. San Francisco will testify that in can happen two out of three years in fact. It all comes down to health, nerves and preparation. A star-studded team like the Dodgers can choke after a cold streak down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Or they could blanket the Cardinals with dominant starting pitching that allows the bullpen to rest until the NLCS. Miguel Cabrera could hit .700 with half a dozen home runs in three games to bomb the Tigers over the A’s. Hell, he could hit like that but the rest of the lineup could freeze in the face of no-name Oakland pitchers who find their groove and hit their spots. And Josh Donaldson might hit .800 and will his team to victory.</p>\n<p>Ok that last one might be a bit of a stretch, but with the parity in baseball this year, we should be in for a postseason for the ages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of forcivilminds.org</em></p><div

ongoing investigations into these labor practices by the UC. They’ve been trying to wash their hands of them, and soon it’s going to catch up to them,” said Erick Ceballos, a third-year political science major and student intern for AFSCME. “They can’t let it go without a fight.”</p>\n<p>University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE), a worker’s union for professional and technical UC employees, joined AFSCME in protesting against the UC. UPTE represents more than 13,000 employees, while AFSCME Local 3299 represents more than 24,000 employees across the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>According to Jarrod Coldron, a former UCSB student, present-day groundskeeper and Member Action Team (M.A.T.) leader for AFSCME, UC allegedly employed intimidation tactics against workers at the most recent solidarity strike with UPTE.</p>\n<p>“For example, we had some bosses that were threatening retaliation against workers who went on strikes. Unfortunately, we actually had some violence on the strike lines at Berkeley and Davis campuses, and as far as I know, that hasn’t been denounced by the UC yet,” Coldron said.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\">altercation</a> between a UC Davis managerial worker and strikers arose when a truck drove close to the picket lines during the three-day strike last fall. A UC Berkeley employee was also tackled to the ground and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/01/uc-berkeley-worker-detained-ucpd-uc-worker-rally/\">arrested</a> in a protest in February of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just out here to affirm that we have a right to speak and that even if we’re being intimidated, we’re going to make sure that our voices are heard.”</p>\n<p>More than 100 members came out to support AFSCME during the strike today, according to Serafin Zamora, UCSB groundskeeper and executive board member for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>Strikers rallied and marched from Storke Tower to Henley Gate, chanting phrases such as “Whose UC? Our UC!” and held signs that said “Standing Together for a Better UC” and “Where’s Yang?”</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, a fourth-year chemistry major at UCSB, explained that flyers with a FAQ were used to intimidate workers before the May strike. The flyers, sent out by UC, contained questions such as, “Can I be fired for striking?” answered by, “Yes, if it is not a legal strike.”</p>\n<p>“There’s more that they can do to support workers, and they’re not doing it.

UCSB Advisory Committee, UCSB, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was authored by Letters and Science Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno and was student sponsored by Dylan Kupsh and Fatima Abdel-Gwad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early morning vote came down to 10 yeses, 14 noes and 0 abstentions; the decision to hold a secret ballot came at the end of a 10 and a half hour Senate meeting once the senators moved into a formal discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, senators vote with verbal or hand signals. A secret ballot allows each senator to anonymously write their vote down on a slip of paper. The slips of paper are then counted by the Internal Vice President (IVP) and A.S. staffers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I respect the vote,” Uribe said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after the meeting ended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of the Wednesday night, Thursday morning meeting was composed of public forum, during which approximately 90 audience members spoke to their opinions about divestment. Throughout the meeting, the audience was relatively split between pro- and anti- divestment stances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first time the Senate has utilized a secret ballot to vote on divestment since 2015. Both senators and their constituents expressed concern about students being doxxed before they chose to vote with the secret ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to divest was originally </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed back in 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when it failed 12-11-1.

Attorney General Ali Suebert disagreed on whether the resolution was directional or positional, throwing the Senate into a debate that ended with</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 12 senators walking out and never returning.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution later termed out at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">68th Senate’s last meeting.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, current A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi spoke midway through public forum about how, after combing through this year’s resolution specifically, her office concluded that it was directional, meaning that it only needed 50% + 1 votes. If it was considered a positional resolution, it would have required a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also clarified the rules regarding abstention votes, and said that senators who abstained would have their votes counted in the majority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution’s student sponsors emphasized that this year’s resolution was not affiliated with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, this was a point of contention with several senators at the table, who noted that the resolution referenced BDS resolutions that had passed at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators – including On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian and proxy Noah Fleishman – left the vote crying. Both had spoken at length during the discussion about their personal experiences with anti-Semitism and how they feel unsafe on campus, noting several anti-Semitic incidents that have occurred in recent weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian and Fleishman both spoke several times through the meeting against the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I firmly believe this resolution provides a platform for hate,” Toubian said around 4 a.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fleishman echoed similar sentiments: “If we go to a secret ballot, understand the safety of the Jewish community is in your hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators and public forum speakers called the resolution inherently anti-Semitic and asked what tangible change it would provide for Palestinian students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas emphasized throughout the meeting that A.S. UCSB had money invested in the companies listed, and public forum speakers and the student sponsors said that they did not want their tuition money to “fund the oppression of Palestinian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call to divest from A.S. UCSB investments was also the reason why Safadi argued that this year’s resolution was directional, in comparison to previous years, which did not have this specific call to action.</span></p>\n<p>Further coverage can be viewed below:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote to pass the divestment resolution failed 10-14-0. <a href=\"https://t.co/SPIkjvOkVi\">pic.twitter.com/SPIkjvOkVi</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1116309213926395905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez and Katherine Swartz contributed reporting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>Updated [12:33 p.m.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office has yet to release an exact breakdown of the data gathered by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) and the University of California Police Department (UCPD), but the preliminary report, released on April 8, shows that there were 94 citations, 38 arrests and 19 medical transports — all alcohol and/or drug related — given out this past Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both locals and out-of-towners were featured on the list of this year’s citations and arrests, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 10 days into April 2019, this month has seen more arrests than any month over the past six — a fact undeniably due to Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was very pleased to see that the number of medical hospitalizations was far lower than last year, proportionate to the size of the event,” Isla Vista Community Service District (I.V. CSD) President Spencer Brandt said in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Brandt noted the arrest log “clearly demonstrates” that there is still a problem with out-of-towners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be moving towards a deltopia that is organized by the community, and has a festival-like atmosphere. The reactive approach that UCSB, the County, the CSD, and other stakeholders have taken over the past 5 years has only taken us so far. It’s time for proactive solutions that transform Deltopia from an unsanctioned into an organized, fun, and safe festival,” Brandt said in a Facebook message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendance for Deltopia, an event that evolved nearly 10 years ago following the shutdown of Floatopia, steadily grew in its initial years; however, following the 2014 Deltopia riots, which ended in tear gas and rubber bullets as previously reported by the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, attendance dramatically dropped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, attendance appears to be rising again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 12,000 to 15,000 partygoers filled the streets of I.V. this year, slightly up from the 10,000 that the SBSO recorded in 2018, but still significantly less than the crowd of 20,000 to 25,000 that attended Deltopia in 2014, according to the report.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87309\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/deltopia-2019_siavash-ghadiri_online-4/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87309\" data-attachment-id=\"87309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/deltopia-2019_siavash-ghadiri_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia 2019_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Deltopia-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCIV volunteers handed out water to partygoers. <em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought Deltopia was very respectful. Everything went smoothly from my end and we were able to deploy UCIV shifts which was very successful,” Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs Jeike Meijer said in a message to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many people came up for water and were very grateful. The estimated number of people who came was higher than we expected but everything remained calm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that this year, several people told her Deltopia felt like a “community event.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one attended our extra office hours on monday which hopefully meant there were no pressing concerns to address with the EVPLA office, but if there are of course people can always still reach out to us. but overall, deltopia went smoothly and people seemed to be respecting each other and the space,” Meijer said in a Facebook message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The press release consistently references Deltopia statistics from five years ago, noting that in spite of the increase in arrests since 2018, “citations and medical transports are still all less than half of what they were in 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the alcohol and/or drug related incidents requiring medical transports were two cases where people fell. One young woman fell and hit her head on a rock, and another young woman fell from a cliff located in the 6800 block of Del Playa “during a domestic dispute.” Neither sustained fatal injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol, as seen in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ arrest map. A few other individuals were arrested for assault, vandalism or petty theft, and one individual was arrested for sodomy by force/violence/fear, use of force with great bodily injury and violation of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Deltopia attendees were also arrested in I.V. late Sunday night for armed robbery, among other charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of direct police intervention, the authorities also stopped and arrested 18-year-old De’shon Wilson, an Oregon native, for allegedly knocking a young man unconscious in the 6500 block of Del Playa, according to the report. Wilson was subsequently kept at Santa Barbara County Jail on assault charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputies from SBSO and the UCPD also reportedly shut down around 10 parties that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia finally drew to a close in the evening as, per the report, the 6 p.m. noise ordinance kicked in and thousands of students emptied out of I.V. and flocked to The Warm Up concert hosted by UCSB at the Thunderdome. The concert, featuring TroyBoi and JPEGMAFIA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ran from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. </span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the Warm Up and Deltopia can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/in-photos-the-warmup-with-jpegmafia-troyboi/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/in-photos-deltopia-2019/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/","id":3223,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3222,3221,3220],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
