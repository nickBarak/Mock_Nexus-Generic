Groups that received partially requested funding included the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), Mu Delta, Pilipino Cultural Night and Hong Kong Student Association while one group was not funded.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cheer Team was reallocated $945 out of $1,540 for a cheer competition in Atlanta, GA, that they can no longer attend in order to put that $945 toward going to Cheer Sport, an international cheer competition in Ontario, Canada, in March. The direct remainder of around $600 was allocated toward attending sporting events other than the USA Nationals in Anaheim, which they are still competing in.</p>\n<p>According to Cheer co-Captain Nick Gorton-Bufano, the team reallocated funds to the Ontario trip due to injuries sustained by team members that prevented them from attending the Atlanta competition.</p>\n<p>“We lost six people to injury and personal family matters, so we could not go, so we would like to take the money that we would have used for hotels and put it towards a competition on March 7,” said Gorton-Bufano.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60442\" style=\"width: 374px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60442\" data-attachment-id=\"60442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-entertains-funding-requests/finance-board_will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=3475%2C2306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3475,2306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422899329\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60442\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=364%2C241\" alt=\"Will Tran/Daily Nexus\" width=\"364\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>EAP received $250; the Cotillion Dance Club received $1,175 to fund three dancing events at the Hub; the Film Studio received $750 for catering and snacks for an event on Feb. 20 in Pollock Theater and the Iranian Graduate Student Association received $1,300 for food for their New Year’s celebration, typically held on March 21.</p>\n<p>According to a speaker for the Iranian Graduate Student Association, the club had to change their event due to the week falling on the same dates as finals week leading into spring break.</p>\n<p>“We are also offering a culture show which includes dancing and like different traditional music performances also from our culture, so that is where our other money is going.

Judges examined the separate projects and decided winners based on work ethic and teamwork, not necessarily on the quality of the final product. Major companies represented at the event included Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Citrix and others.</p>\n<p>SB Hacks also held a series of educational tech talks this past Saturday, the second day of the three-day Hackathon weekend, to introduce participants to new topics in computer science and to assist hackers with project challenges that had arisen over the course of the competition.</p>\n<p>The talks covered a wide range of topics including discussion on game design and workshops for platforms such as Cydia, eSports and Angular, and for teaching Swift, an iOS programming language used to design applications. During the workshops, programmers of all levels also had an opportunity to write online versions of the best-selling mobile game Flappy Bird.</p>\n<p>The event also featured special amenities for participants including free meals, Nerf gun competitions, meditation sessions and formal video game tournaments for console games such as Super Smash Bros and Halo.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60364\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60364\" data-attachment-id=\"60364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Several video game tournaments were held in a tent just outside the Corwin Pavilion.

He also introduced his program Cydia, an alternative to the Apple app store, and focused on its ability to customize devices with specific features not available in Apple’s app store.</p>\n<p>“Not everything is an app that could go in the app store in the first place … Cydia instead is about extensions and modifications,” Freeman said, “Cydia is a place where you can get custom looks for your phone, you can go and get new features … you can also make modifications inside of apps.”</p>\n<p>Third-year computer science major Andrew Dutcher said his team created a smartphone app allowing music from different playlists or tracks to start playing once you enter a designated geographical area.</p>\n<p>“You have a map on an Android phone, you make a circle, step into the circle in the real, physical world and music will play from one playlist,” Dutcher said. “Step out of the circle and music will play from another playlist. Step back in, it will play from the first playlist again.”</p>\n<p>According to Dutcher, the application his team created was inspired by video game programming.</p>\n<p>“The impetus for this problem is a 3D programmer in videogames. If you go from area A to area B, there will be a pop up and the music changes,” Dutcher said. “So you have theme music for areas. This is obviously useful to have music for different areas or for self-guided tours. Augmenting reality with geographical based theme music is really satisfying!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60368\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60368\" data-attachment-id=\"60368\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-8.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Hacksrs presenting their hacks at the first rouhd of the exposition.

If we had more time, we’d be able to graph it and you’d see some oscillations that would reflect the rate of oxygen consumption in your blood.”</p>\n<p>West College electrical engineering major Robin Morales, one of Anderson’s teammates, and said he hopes the device can be made smaller, more portable and more practical for everyday use.</p>\n<p>“We did this so you can take it with you,” Morales said. “You don’t need to be in a hospital room or have a huge clunky device at home. … It interfaces with a computer; you can enjoy your hike and see how you did instead of constantly checking. …The components will get smaller and cheaper and then can get integrated with smart phones or even fitness watches.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the team’s project transcended winning a prize and that their creation and development of the app was what team members were most proud of.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t finished the software yet, so you know, we might win something,” Anderson said. “But we didn’t come here to win, we came here to learn something.”</p>\n<p>UCLA computer science major Dee Chen said his team created a portable paper piano that allows users a more affordable and accessible alternative to learning and playing the piano.</p>\n<p>“It’s sensing capacitants. Your body acts as a natural capacitant. So when you touch it, it sends a signal and we can measure that signal and then can play a sound off of that. It’s sort of like the touch screen on an iPhone,” Chen said. “There’s different notes, which activate from pressing your finger on the wires.”</p>\n<p>According to Chen, the piano costs less than $30 and will allow individuals who are unable to afford pianos to learn and play at an affordable price.</p>\n<p>“The second part of this is that let’s say you want some piano lessons without actually paying the price for them,” Chen said. “Well, if you press this one wire, it will send a signal to a computer to a different piano. So you could essentially teach someone how to play piano with only two of these paper pianos — you don’t need a real one.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60369\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60369\" data-attachment-id=\"60369\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Live music accompanied the hackathon as students wait and rest.

Out of the six plays produced at UCSB in the 2013-2014 school year, four of the plays were written by female playwrights.</p>\n<p>Department of Theater and Dance Chair Risa Brainin said she is honored that the university is a recipient of the ICWP award.</p>\n<p>“We are very proud to be part of this international movement to create a gender parity across the world,” Brainin said.</p>\n<p>According to Brainin, the Season Selection Committee is an organization that goes over and chooses plays to be produced at UCSB. In 2014, the Season Selection Committee made a conscious effort to produce plays written by women, Brainin said. </p>\n<p>Third-year theater major Charles Grant said the 50/50 Applause Award is a demonstration of the Theater and Dance’s program to provide a wide array of perspectives, particularly from “the female voice” which, according to Grant, “isn’t often heard.”</p>\n<p>“It is also great that our department decided to choose many productions that were written by females because it gives power and voice to the female perspective,” Grant said. “It also gives the opportunity for females cast in those productions to be able to tell those stories that need to be told.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her involvement with the Department of Theater and Dance, Brainin was also named presidet of the National Theater Conference this year, a national non-profit dedicated to support for and advocacy of American theater. According to Brainin, there is a Women Playwright Initiative within the National Theater Conference, which she hopes will influence the department on campus. </p>\n<p>Kris Bauske, Applause Award co-chair and ICWP board member, said the award marks a progressive change in theater, placing the Theater and Dance program at “the vanguard of social change.”</p>\n<p>“The organizations that received the award step out of that comfort zones and say that they are going to challenge the audience to become in tune with the voices of female playwrights and help them to progress along so that they are as interested in plays written by women as they are written by men,” Bauske said. </p>\n<p>However, Bauske also said there is still room for improvement, even within organizations that have received the award.</p>\n<p>“We are pretty much evenly sliced. We are about 50 percent men and 50 percent women. And yet the majority of plays being produced are written by men,” Bauske said. “That tells us that society is putting a lot more importance on stories about men by men for men, or that women are just not having the opportunity to have their voices heard.”</p>\n<p>According to Bauske, consumers of art should be more cognizant to producing stories that women will be likely to value.</p>\n<p>“Typically, the storytellers that I have heard are women,” Bauske said. “It’s not that women are incapable of creating the same art that men are. It’s just that people need to become more attuned with the stories that women find important.”</p>\n<p>Brainin said the Department of Theater and Dance will continue to progress and to produce plays that are written by a diverse groups of people. </p>\n<p>“This year we focused more on writers of color. We want to have a diversity of voices,” Brainin said. “We are focusing on playwrights from different countries, from different ethnic backgrounds. We are trying to reach out to all kinds of communities.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/dept-of-theater-and-dance-named-2014-5050-applause-award-recipient/","id":2902,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[2901,2900,2899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Distinguished Guests For Opening of Confucius Institute","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s Confucius Institute, an international establishment to promote the study of Chinese language, culture, history, science, politics and economics, held its opening ceremony Monday in McCune Hal...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB’s Confucius Institute, an international establishment to promote the study of Chinese language, culture, history, science, politics and economics, held its opening ceremony Monday in McCune Hall.</p>\n<p>The Confucius Institute, one of about 400 installments located around the world, will operate out of HSSB 2220 in partnership with Shandong University in China. Representatives from the university, Shandong University, the City of Santa Barbara and the Consulate General of the Peoples Republic of China in Los Angeles were all present at the ceremony. The Institute is funded by the Office of Hanban, located in Beijing, China, with UCSB matching funds.</p>\n<p>Religious Studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang said she began the process of starting the Confucius Institute in 2010.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy to see that everything is finally in place,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the Confucius Institute would aid graduate students and faculty whose research involves Chinese Studies.</p>\n<p>“Our Confucius Institute will place a special emphasis not only on language teaching, but on research,” Yang said. “We will put a lot of the Confucius Institute’s energies and funds into promoting China Studies on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, more than half of the university’s international students come from China, and the new Confucius Institute will facilitate interaction between Chinese and American students.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to increase the synergy between International Students Studying at UCSB and our own students who have an interest in China,” Yang said. “We will try to hold social activities and scholarly lectures where we bring these two constituencies together.”</p>\n<p>Yang said collaboration between countries like China and the United States is necessary in order to take on global issues such as climate change, terrorism and economic inequality.</p>\n<p>“We have so many global problems that no country can solve,” said Yang. “We all have to come together and deal with our differences — graciously, politely, but persistently — and at the same time try to make stronger bridges so that we can understand each other better and ultimately work together to address these global issues.”</p>\n<p>Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Jian Liu said the Confucius Institute will teach students Chinese languages in order to facilitate communication between China and the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Language is a bridge connecting different countries and peoples,” Liu said. “Confucius Institute has become this for promoting the beautiful Chinese language.”</p>\n<p>Yang also spoke at the ceremony and said the Confucius Institute illustrates the university’s dedication to a global education.</p>\n<p>“Today as we watch the Confucius Institute on campus, we are creating another opportunity for UC Santa Barbara to facilitate cultural exchange, expand our commitment to global education, and extend new learning and research options to our students,” Yang said. “We feel very, very honored to be able to sign this agreement with Shandong University.”</p>\n<p>Chairman of the University Council for Shandong University Shouxin Li said the Confucius Institute on campus is distinct from others in the U.S. due to its academic collaboration with Shandong University in China.</p>\n<p>“Although there are many Confucius Institutes located around the United States, I can assure you that the University of California, Santa Barbara Confucius Institute is unique because it is established through the cooperation between UCSB and Shandong University — a University near the hometown of Confucius,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said he takes pride in the university’s strengths “in Chinese Language, history, living art, culture and society.”</p>\n<p>“We really hope in partnership with Hanban and our distinguished colleagues at Shandong University to build on these strengths and advance study, education and research in these areas for many years to come,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor pro tempore Gregg Hart said Santa Barbara has honored its Spanish history and is happy to see that it is now focusing on the knowledge of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to say that we’ve come to a place where we’re going to respect both historical traditions,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Matt Share, who is in his second year of studying Chinese, said he hopes the Confucius Institute will mean more Chinese language classes will be offered at the university.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the intro Chinese language courses are offered in a one-year sequence, so if you want to take Chinese and you’re at a certain level, but you miss that course because of a course conflict, you have to wait a whole year,” said Share.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chinese international student majoring in economics Xiaoke Ma performed at the ceremony on a Hulusi, a traditional instrument of the Yunnan province in southern China. She said the Confucius Institute would give her the opportunity to share her culture the campus community.</p>\n<p>“I could let my foreign friends know what the Confucius Institute is and I could show them some of my music, like what I did today,” Ma said. “The way I speak, the way I think — it’s really different from what you guys [American students] think.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Dean of the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University and editor-in-chief of China’s <em>Journal of Literature, History and Philosophy</em>, Professor Xuedian Wang said the institute is representative of “a great opportunity to make a commitment” to cultural enrichment.</p>\n<p>“I believe there is huge potential for our inter-cooperation,” Wang said, “So let’s work together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/","id":2903,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2902,2901,2900],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
