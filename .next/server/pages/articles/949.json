Curry racked up an amazing double-double, scoring a game-high 31 points and 14 rebounds, while Holt had a well-rounded 5 rebounds and 5 assists to go along with her 21-point performance.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another dominating double-double night, draining a team-high 27 points, and grabbing 14 boards, which was tied with Riverside’s Curry for the most in the game.</p>\n<p>With just under 9 minutes left to play in regulation, UCSB trailed by 11, the score sitting at 53-42 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter began to heat up for the Gauchos, as Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar combined for an explosive 25 of the team’s 32 points in the last quarter. Despite their valiant effort, though, the home team still trailed by six, the score 68-62 with only 41 seconds left to play.</p>\n<p>Sahar scored a clutch three-pointer from beyond the arc, and after the opponents scored, Sahar attempted to drain another shot from downtown, but was fouled and knocked down all three free throw attempts, to bring the game to 69-68, UCSB behind by just 1 point.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders were fouled and scored just one of their two free throws, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter passed the ball to Edelman who had a good look and shot the ball in to tie the game up at 70, with just 8 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Curry attempted a shot to take the game for UCR, but the shot fell out of bounds, possession then belonging to the home team.</p>\n<p>It looked as if the Gauchos would be set up to play their first overtime game since the 2014-2015 season, but that turned out to not be the case.</p>\n<p>While regulation seemingly ended with the score tied up at 70-70, the officials put 1.5 seconds back on the game clock after review.</p>\n<p>That last second and a half was sufficient enough for the home team to get the walk off win.</p>\n<p>Toler inbounded the pass to freshman guard Sarah Bates who was fouled and forced to leave the game after being injured on the play.</p>\n<p>Coming in to complete the play by shooting her free throws, Bates knocked in both attempts, allowing UCSB to win the game without extra OT minutes.</p>\n<p>It was a special night in the Thunderdome, as the 27 points for Edelman are tied for her career-high, with this being her sixth double-double in the last seven games. Toler had 10 dimes, which is also tied for her career-high in assists, and her second straight home game dishing out double digits assists. Sahar ended the game with a season-high 21 points, and just two points away from her career-high.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot at 46.3 percent on 25-for-54 shooting, while UCR scored at a slightly higher 49.1 percent on 27-for-55 shooting. Both teams were aggressive offensively, the home team just showing more assertiveness late down the stretch.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are geared to play their last game of the regular season on the road against Hawai’i on Thursday, Mar. 1 at 9:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-24/ucsb-comes-from-behind-in-exciting-senior-day-victory/","id":949,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[948,947,946],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[131,204,215,657,663,711,766,844,881,895,896,942,943,948,949,974,1877,3388,3400],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Dismantle Irvine by 28 points for Third-Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's two-game home stand ended with the Gauchos crushing UC Irvine for their third consecutive win.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81150\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1668358900\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81163\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81150\" data-attachment-id=\"81150\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/sarah-porter-heads-for-the-hoop-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sarah Porter heads for the hoop.

The Gauchos came to play Saturday night, demonstrating confidence and a new sense of direction during their blowout of the second-place Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t stop attacking,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We stayed aggressive and we buckled down and still defended when we couldn’t score. Those two things we haven’t been consistent with but we were pretty good tonight.

Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman tallied another double-double with apparent ease as she recorded 12 points and 15 rebounds. It was Edelman’s fourht double-double finish in the team’s last five games.</p>\n<p>Fellow redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler joined Edelman with a double-double of her own that featured 10 points and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper’s game-high 15 points combined with Sarah Bates’ 11 and Sarah Porter’s 12 put the game out of reach for Irvine.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter, both teams got into foul trouble early, as Bates picked up two fouls and Irvine’s star junior guard Morgan Green got called for her third foul around the five minute mark.</p>\n<p>An odd display of foul calls paired with back and forth scoring resulted in Santa Barbara and Irvine being tied at 12 following a jumper by Roper with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A minute later, Irvine took the lead via freshman forward Jordan Sanders’ mid-range jumper. Unfortunately for Irvine, Sanders’ shot would be the Anteaters’ last field goal until 4:22 remained in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Down 14-12, the Gauchos flipped the script on Irvine in a huge way. Sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez sunk a three to start the scoring-frenzy for Santa Barbara, which featured two more threes from Roper, an Edelman layup and a Tal Sahar buzzer-beating corner three to close out the quarter up 26-15.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the second quarter on a 9-0 run as part of its 23-1 run carried over from the end of the first.</p>\n<p>Edelman scored six-straight herself and another Sahar three-ball made it 35-15 in favor of the Gauchos. Down 20, Irvine finally got a shot to fall junior guard when Andee Ritter knocked down a jumper.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters made just 3 of their 13 shot attempts in the quarter but avoided the 20-point deficit at halftime, as they trailed 40-24. Irvine’s struggle to scoring nine points in the quarter was due much credit to UCSB’s defensive prowess during the game as the Anteaters had reached triple digits in scoring twice in their last three games.</p>\n<p>After sitting out for the entirety of the second quarter with two fouls, Bates knocked down a three to start the second half and followed it up with a jumper for five-straight points.</p>\n<p>The freshman guard Bates continues to impress this season, as she scored 7 of her 12 points in the third to maintain the Gauchos comfortable lead.</p>\n<p>Haleigh Talbert knocked down a jumper for Irvine just over the 6-minute mark and a 9-6 run by Irvine put the Anteaters within 18 to start the fourth.</p>\n<p>The final quarter opened with yet another bucket from beyond the arc via Roper, extending UCSB’s lead to 21. Sophomore center Natalia Bruening gave the Gauchos good production off the bench, as she scored five points in the fourth and allowed Henrickson to rest Edelman when needed.</p>\n<p>Bruening’s layup and then another Roper three-pointer gave UCSB a 24-point lead with still over 8 minutes remaining. A short burst of scoring from Irvine placed the Anteaters within 16 at the 6-minute mark, but their Hack-a-Shaq strategy of fouling Drea Toler everytime she got the ball didn’t play out well for them.</p>\n<p>UCSB made 13-of-22 free throws in the fourth quarter to secure the win down the stretch. Toler herself was 8-14 from the line and had 10 points as part of UCSB’s 29-point quarter. Despite managing a 20-point quarter as a team, Irvine simply couldn’t catch up to the hot-handed Gauchos, falling 82-55.</p>\n<p>Morgan Green, who came into the game averaging 24.5 points per game, got locked down by UCSB. The Gauchos switched on screens to contain Green and forced her into 9 turnovers on 0-8 shooting from three.</p>\n<p>“Morgan Green, who’s so explosive and such a good one-on-one player, obviously between Drea and [Akilah Jennings] they did a really good job,”Henrickson said.“We did a really good job of not fouling her, we were much more disciplined.”</p>\n<p>Green led her team with 13 points on a less-than efficient night finding the net. Irvine shot 29.9 percent from the field and only 10.5 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outrebounded Irvine 51-37 and outscored the Anteaters in the paint 24-18, but it was UCSB’s capitalization off turnovers that separated the two teams. While UCSB committed 22 turnovers, Irvine turned those turnovers into only 13 points whereas the Gauchos converted Irvine’s 19 turnovers into 31 points.</p>\n<p>On a three-game winning streak and tied with Cal Poly for third in the Big West, the Blue-Green rivalry this coming week will have high stakes for each team seeking to make a run in the standings as conference play nears its end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/","id":946,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[945,944,943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho-Mania: MBB Carries 7-Game Streak Into LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Holding on to first place in the Big West is one of the main priorities for the UCSB men's basketball team.

Unsurprisingly, the senior is key to Long Beach success, and is a common focal point for defenses.</p>\n<p>Opposing defenses can afford to focus on Levin because his supporting cast hasn’t done much to make them pay for doing so.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have four players – Max Heidegger, Jalen Canty, Leland King II and Gabe Vincent – between Levin and his next closest teammate in conference scoring.</p>\n<p>Part of that is due to junior transfer guard Bryan Alberts’s nine-game absence due to injury, but the Gonzaga transfer has been slow to readjust since returning to the lineup four games ago.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Temidayo Yussuf has stepped up to give the 49ers another low post threat, and put up a 17 point, 11 rebound double-double in his most recent game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host the Gauchos on Thursday, which plays to a major advantage for a Long Beach State team that is 7-4 at the Walter Pyramid and just 5-8 in away games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be able road warriors with a 7-5 away record, including a major win in Davis over the Aggies most recently.</p>\n<p>That win last Thursday is what propelled UCSB to their solitary perch atop the standings, but it’s unlikely to be a comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Even if the Gauchos are able to fight off the 49ers on Thursday, they’ll then have to take on the Aggies once more on Saturday, this time in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>With a home winning streak of 11 games to start the season, the longest such run in school history, the Gauchos have reason to feel confident even against such formidable and motivated guests as the Aggies.</p>\n<p>In the first matchup, UCSB controlled much of the game, aside from a strong stretch run by UC Davis to make things close late in the game. Junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, receiving extra minutes in the absence of Canty, was instrumental late in the game with eight points, all in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to overcome Canty’s absence due to a suspension for violating team rules, but the team has made no announcements on the timetable for his return. Barring a change in status before Thursday, UCSB will likely have to adapt once again.</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos were able to do so thanks to a balanced team offensive effort. Four players finished in double-digits, with Leland King II leading the way with 19 points and 15 rebounds, his fifth double-double of Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t be the only team dealing with a mysterious and impactful suspension on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCD’s star forward, Chima Moneke, has missed the team’s last three games after being sent home prior to the team’s Feb. 3 game against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are 2-0 without their suspended forward, the Aggies have struggled a bit more, going 1-2 while sliding down from first place in the Big West to a tie for third.</p>\n<p>The reasons and timetable for Moneke’s return are still up in the air, so it’s quite possible both teams will once again be shorthanded on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Junior guard TJ Shorts II has stepped up in Moneke’s absence with almost 27 points per game in the last three games. Junior Siler Schneider has also taken on an expanded role, but the Aggies haven’t been able to fully replicate Moneke’s production.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a tough midterms week ahead of them, with two games against teams with a combined conference record of 14-8.</p>\n<p>A successful week however, would cement the team’s status as the one to best in Big West play, and push UCSB past 20 wins for the first time since 2009-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Long Beach State on Thursday in Long Beach at 7 p.m. The ’Chos then host UC Davis in the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 15 of the Feb. 15</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/","id":947,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[946,945,944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Puts 3-Game Win Streak on the Line Against Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following three straight conference wins, UCSB will hope to take out its bitter green rival Cal Poly and take control of third place in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81172\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"256722274\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81190\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81172\" data-attachment-id=\"81172\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/drea-toler-slides-around-the-defense-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drea Toler slides around the defense.

Dishing out 10 dimes and scoring a commanding 10 points, Toler was on fire.</p>\n<p>Following the win, the Gauchos are currently 11-14 overall and 8-5 in the Big West. They are also winners of three straight games. The outcome of the game places UCSB one game closer to second-seeded UC Irvine in the standings.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, Santa Barbara is in third place in the Big West, tied with Cal Poly, their next opponent.</p>\n<p>This upcoming game has serious conference contentions, as it gives either team the opportunity to be the lone third seed and to inch closer to the two-seed spot.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be hosting Santa Barbara as they come off a loss from Cal State Northridge, where they fell 86-66, but not from a lack of effort.</p>\n<p>There are some dangerous players on the Mustangs, and UCSB will need to be on high alert for their balanced attack.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Dynn Leaupepe scored a monster 29 points in the last game for Cal Poly and averages 25.5 points per game during conference play on 46 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Her offensive approach is a potent one and is something the Gauchos will have to guard against if they want to contain their opponent.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch out for is senior guard Lynn Leaupepe. Grabbing seven rebounds in the last game versus Cal State Northridge, L. Leaupepe has over 30 offensive rebounds and 50 defensive rebounds in recent conference games, averaging six rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Boxing out and grabbing boards is going to have a major impact on Cal Poly’s game versus USCB, so it will be interesting to see how the Gauchos match Cal Poly’s intensity under the basket. In their last game, Cal Poly shot 41.2 percent from the field on 28-for-68 shooting.</p>\n<p>Their offense fell flat in the third quarter, which is where CSUN began to run away. If the Mustangs keep their foot on the gas with their normal scoring attack, they will be a tough opponent to beat.</p>\n<p>Averaging 65 points per game on 40.6 percent shooting, the Gauchos will face a worthy opponent in the Mustangs, who average 70 points per game on 39.8 percent shooting. Two equally matched opponents with a lot to play for.</p>\n<p>Look out for the bench play on both teams. Santa Barbara usually has a superior bench in comparison to their opponents, their reserves often making worthy contributions to the game.</p>\n<p>Not to be dismissed, though, is the bench play of Cal Poly. The home team also has a great bench, which was evident in their last bout, where the reserves put 37 points on the board.</p>\n<p>Both benches match up nicely, and their head-to-head battle will be a big influence on the outcome of the game. This will be a Blue-Green Rivalry game to remember, as both teams have serious consquences on the line.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 21, at the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":948,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[947,946,945],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
