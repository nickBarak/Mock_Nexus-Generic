Director Jeanne Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Merchant, the demands played an integral role in her decision to work at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was inspired by the agency and activism of students to ask for what they need and to use their voices and resources to get their needs met.  I would not have left LA … if it had not been for the opportunity to respond to the call of Black students who were feeling unsupported, underrepresented, and invisible,” Merchant said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant, who grew up in Los Angeles but spent “15 summers in a row in Chicago where my parents were born,” said her parents moved to California to provide her with more opportunities than they believed she would have in Chicago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They instilled pride in being Black, demanded that I speak up for myself, and regularly told me that I could do anything that I put my mind to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a psychologist was a natural choice for Merchant, who said she has always been the person that friends confided in and looked to for advice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I chose to go to graduate school with the thought, ‘Everyone tells me their deepest darkest secrets and talks to be about anything, why not get paid to be me?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant’s areas of focus are women’s health, academic success, overall student wellness and “empowering and supporting students who may feel marginalized and specifically students from the African Diaspora,” according to the C.A.P.S. website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have always worked in settings in which I advocated for underrepresented populations and helped give voice to the voiceless,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant cited her own personal experiences as the reason she cares so much about helping others find solutions to their problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My personal reproductive trauma, having a daughter (Nailah Asha) that died the day before her first birthday in 2006, led to me learning the statistic that Black college educated women are twice as likely to have an infant die than a white woman who drops of out high school,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My loss and this data, fueled my passion for being part of the solution that reduces levels of stress of people who look like me (and anyone else I come in contact with) because too many babies and mothers are dying unnecessarily due to the structural and institutional racism across the life span, lived and passed on through generations, and it needs to stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant hopes to help Black students find peace and a sense of belonging and safety through counseling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At predominantly white serving institutions, more often than not, many students of color, and especially Black students find themselves fighting against being treated as inferior and as if they don’t belong before they even step into a classroom,” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students of color, particularly Black students, may not feel as comfortable asking for help as others for a variety of reasons, Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s a lack of trust in institutions, but there are also cultural stigmas for students of color who might be shamed for talking about their family’s private business or who worry about being called crazy, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is much easier to seek help if one feels as if someone understands their struggle and reduces the burden that students have felt to teach the counselor about the struggle to be Black at a white serving institution before they can get the help they need.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her time so far at UCSB, Merchant’s proudest accomplishment is establishing for Black students that she is there to support them and that she truly sees them. Since her and Barfield’s time at UCSB, Black students have utilized C.A.P.S. in larger numbers, Merchant said, and lately the program has been working to reach out to students more as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as she works to support Black students on campus, Merchant faces her own struggle on a predominantly white campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been lonely and overwhelming as the only Black female psychologist in CAPS,” she said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a Black staff member at UCSB mirrors the Black student experience in many ways and having community is essential and important for me too” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BSU Demands Team recently released a set of demands in early February, addressing the need for more Black student advocacy on campus, both institutionally and one-on-one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant believes the completion of these demands, particularly the construction of a building named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development,” would increase Black student retention and graduation in a significant way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that it would be very supportive, empowering, and meaningful for Black students to have a place that they can call their own, where they feel a sense of belonging, and are encouraged, in word and action, to be their best selves.  Where they are guaranteed to see people who look like them and to trust that their needs are important and their existence is validated,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a freestanding building for Black students was one written into the first demands released in 1968. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need to take more responsibility for our role in improving the mental health of all students.  This is not just the responsibility of psychologists in the counseling center but it is everyone’s responsibility,” Merchant wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, with respect to Black students who I believe make up the second smallest ethnic group on campus, greater efforts need to be made to create, sustain, and enrich the experiences and environment for Black students,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are people working independently on initiatives to improve Black student admission, retention and graduation rates, Merchant believes that centralizing those operations is key to being accessible to Black students who need help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also believes that while Student Affairs has prioritized diversity, inclusion and equity, individual professors and academic departments need to be held accountable for creating classrooms where Black students are not made to feel out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many Black students and other students of marginalized populations enter classrooms on the defense due to how they are treated by classmates as well as professors,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many professors are not held accountable for their complicit behavior and students suffer.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:12 a.m.]:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Merchant’s first name is Meridith, not Meredith.

She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/","id":3174,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3173,3172,3171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Black History Month Book Pop-ups Come to UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/no-idea-who-this-is_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/no-idea-who-this-is_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For Solomon, the idea behind the pop-up goes back to one of the fundamental underpinnings of the university: the value of diversity.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many people, figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Frederick Douglass are household names; their work and efforts to better the lives of Black people in America are studied and revered in books, movies and other media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Zion Solomon, second-year history of public policy major, these narratives are far from the complete story of Black history.

400;\">revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seeking the liberation of all oppressed peoples by toppling capitalism, according to their former Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was known for its radical approach to organizing and meeting the material needs of Black and other oppressed groups with free breakfast and groceries programs, free clinics, political education and armed protection from police abuse according to </span><a href=\"https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/longmoreinstitute/bundles/230640\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former chairwoman of the Party Elaine Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexandra Gessesse, UCSB’s Black Student Union financial director, introduced Huggins that night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ericka Huggins taught herself to meditate as a means to survive incarceration … since then she incorporated spiritual practice into her community work and as a speaker and facilitator, teaching it as a tool for change,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins started off her lecture on the topic of having an “attitude of gratitude,” which over the years helped ease the pain of incarceration and being subjected to solitary confinement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you feel like a speck of pepper in a sea of rice, remember gratitude,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also served as her first of many motions for audience participation, asking those in attendance to reflect briefly on someone or something they are grateful for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins prefaced her later remarks on identity, activism and change by describing what it means to be aware of humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most all the isms — sexism, racism [and] classism — all of them are really not based in hatred. They look like they’re hateful, but they’re based in fear. Which is an irrational emotion for any of us to have.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins further posited that said “isms” aren’t to be attributed to individuals but to the institutions that manufacture and reproduce them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s structural … Remember that no one man or woman or group of men and women is responsible. It was here before they got here and before the ones before them,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins then segued into identity from these statements, pointing out the significance of coinciding identities existing in one body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we say my identity is human, which it is for all of us, there are other identities folded in … all in this one body,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are a man and a gay man, those are coinciding identities. If you are a man and you are heterosexual, [those are] coinciding identities. When the two men meet there could be some learning there … if our socialization didn’t get in the way of the two men talking, and that socialization teaches us to be fearful of what we don’t know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins transitioned into discussing activism, first by explaining what it meant to embody the essence of activism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Activism is what you do, how you participate in creating the transformation you want to see in this world. In other words it’s the dues you pay for taking up space on the planet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not a monolithic thing … [but] it needs to be a little bit beyond Facebook, okay,” said Huggins, joking with the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins, in between her humor, didn’t leave out the somber reality that can accompany activism, particularly of people like herself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe you think that an activist has to live the kind of life that I lived. You don’t want my life. I assure you. It’s not romantic. It’s not pretty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins spoke about change and transformation, noting her time in Upstate New York, learning from children who were researching the life cycle of a butterfly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t just change. They transform,” Huggins said a boy exclaimed to her at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins connected this anecdote to her and the Black Panther Party’s struggle for a transformation of society beyond the previous change achieved in the 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A change would be civil rights, which are the rights you are due by law … human rights, if they’re honored, would be the rights you are due by your very birth. That is transformation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins laced the concepts of identity, activism and change together by advising the audience to step outside of the boxes built up around them and rejecting those imposed upon others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whatever you were told about yourself and about others, if it doesn’t hold them up as fully human, you can let go of it … The universe won’t dissolve into the cosmos if we let go of some old, tired, whatever it is, but it’s important that we begin because freedom, is an inside job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few students after the lecture offered their thoughts on which passages resonated most with them, and discussed the connection to the current political climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish the talk was longer because every time I thought I knew something, her views on life told me different,” Aryn Jackson, a third-year communication major said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson related to Huggins’ belief that no one identity can fully explain the qualities of a person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nashelle Brown, a third-year film and media studies major, related the lecture to political polarization in the U.S. She pointed out that immense tension can impede change as well as the transformation that Huggins defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s favorite quote encapsulates Huggins’ lasting message of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of these privileges are anyone’s fault; it’s how we use it.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.
