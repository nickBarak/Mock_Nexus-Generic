Approves Shorter Meetings","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last night’s weekly Associated Students Senate meeting saw the proposal for a resolution that would effectively limit the duration of meetings, launching student senators and executive officers into...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last night’s weekly Associated Students Senate meeting saw the proposal for a resolution that would effectively limit the duration of meetings, launching student senators and executive officers into a lengthy debate on the benefits and drawbacks of cutting meeting times for greater “productivity.”</p>\n<p>Penned by on-campus senator Mac Kennedy and off- campus senator Tuquan Harrison, a bill entitled “Resolution to Maximize Senate Meeting” was presented as an effort to provide what it called increased productivity by requiring meeting times to end by 9:45 p.m. and limiting the duration of executive officer reports and senate discussions.</p>\n<p>While some senators asserted that meetings exceeding five hours in length detract from the overall efficiency and well- being of the Senate, other students — including all executive officers — argued that longer meetings are sometimes neces- sary, despite occasionally imposing unpleasant infringements on the schedules and personal health of A.S. members.</p>\n<p>The bill cites a lack of Senate efficiency and enthusiasm as the main reason meetings should end earlier and potentially push unfinished tasks into later weeks.</p>\n<p>“The consistently inordinate length of weekly Senate meetings drastically hinders Senate productivity, passion for the job and our ability to be excellent student leaders,” the bill states.</p>\n<p>In defense of his proposal, Kennedy argued that the bill could result in other changes more agreeable to the needs of Senate members. He added that the resignations of eightsenators during Fall quarter were likely due to the extensive length of meetings, which end anytime between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. with last night’s meeting coming to a close at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We figured we needed to change the culture of the Senate,” Kennedy said, referring to himself and Harrison. “I don’t think this bill is an end-all but I think it’s a really good start.”</p>\n<p>Despite the support of several senators, the bill faced adamant opposition from executive officers and some Public Forum speakers. A.S. President Sophia Armen voiced con- cerns about A.S. members’ dedication and accountability, stating that Senate should not be treated as an easy job and senators should willingly listen to the input of all public forum speakers.</p>\n<p>“This job is hard. You should have all known that going in,” Armen said. “In my opinion, the most people we should be listening to are the people who walk in here … If any of you are resigning because of this — that is unacceptable…The reality is, it’s not about enjoying.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segoviap said in her past meetings with A.S. organizations of other schools, there were noticeably fewer resignations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, on-campus senator Kevin Rudolph voiced his support by claiming that other schools had similar time limits, adding that long meetings cause him to question his own dedication to the group.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, to come here, I love what I’m doing but this meeting is most of the time a burden and it’s very unproduc- tive,” Rudolph said. “I know that other schools have time limits or things like that. I would like to see this [bill] passed.”</p>\n<p>In response to such claims, Armen said students should maintain better focus or initiate more efficient practices in meetings instead of simply slashing meeting times.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that half of the discussion going on in this room isn’t even the projects,” Armen said. “Instead of having 25 minutes of discussion on productivity, why not actually be productive?”</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, who acts as the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the A.S. Office of the President, rec- ognized the importance of reducing stress for senators but agreed that longer meetings can be necessary to ensure that all business is finished.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize that there is a need to retain senators and make the job easier,” Lakhani said. “But sometimes a four- and-a-half hour meeting isn’t long enough for Senate business … Your meetings take time and your discussions are tough because that’s the nature of what comes to you.”</p>\n<p>Senators resolved to table — essentially postpone — the bill indefinitely. However, there was agreement that A.S. members would spend time at future meetings brainstorming and discussing new methods of increasing productivity and decreasing meeting length.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 10, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/","id":3104,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3103,3102,3101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Each brigade disperses medical supplies to a village until replaced by the next brigade the following month.</p>\n<p>This year’s UCSB dispatch will take place June 17 to 27 and focus on two different communities in Ghana’s Abuakwa region.</p>\n<p>UCSB GMB Treasurer Paola Cardenas, a fourth-year biology major, said $2,000 of the student funds would supply malaria medication and the rest would finance other medication including painkillers, antibiotics and vitamins, while participants would personally cover all other travel costs.</p>\n<p>“Everything comes out of our own pockets including airfare … this is a complete volunteer trip,” Cardenas said. “It’s not just a group of kids going on a vacation … It’s a group of kids going to help people [and] to make lives better.”</p>\n<p>The 10-day trip includes medication distribution, patient consultation, door-to-door greetings and a public health day educating local communities about water filtration systems and the importance of sanitation.</p>\n<p>GMB Vice President of Fundraising Steven Tilem, a fourth-year microbiology major, said the local chapter is being given the honor of representing the U.S. as one of the first groups involved in the new Ghana program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is one of the lucky few United States programs that has the opportunity to be a foundation for this new community,” Tilem said. “It is a great opportunity, and it is all based on the fact that we have a great reputation not only with excellent funding and support from our school and community, but because of the dedication of students and UCSB in general.”</p>\n<p>GMB President Jamie Miller, a fourth-year biology major, said the club ultimately seeks to better the living standards in the Ghanaian communities.</p>\n<p>“Our primary goal is to go to these communities that do not have adequate access to health care,” Miller said. “In Ghana, we will organize medications to distribute and go door-to-door to identify problems so that we can [ultimately] prevent them.”</p>\n<p>The board fully funded the group in the amount of $4,625 with the stipulation that it host an A.S. awareness event.</p>\n<p>According to Cardenas, all students can apply to participate in UCSB’s Global Medical Brigades. Last fall, 40 students were selected to go on the Ghana trip.</p>\n<p>In addition, 15 local healthcare professionals traveled to Ghana, including UCSB faculty member and alumnus Dr. Jason Prystowsky.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-28/funds-aid-humanitarian-efforts/","id":3101,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3100,3099,3098],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Discuss Hurricane Relief, I.V.

The Senate also accepted Off-Campus Senator Cory Wheeler’s resignation and decided who would be responsible for finding his replacement.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Andrew Soriano proposed post-Hurricane Sandy clean-up efforts, emphasizing the gravity of the disastrous situation and citing similar fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>“The hurricane pretty much devastated the East Coast,” Soriano said. “I know in the past we have organized efforts with things like Hurricane Katrina.”</p>\n<p>Soriano’s idea was met with support and enthusiasm. Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia suggested a blood drive to help aide shortages in areas heavily affected by the storm.</p>\n<p>“There has been a blood shortage because of so many people being wounded … blood banks have been affected as well,” Segovia said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Segovia also encouraged a partnership with Red Cross to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Miya Sommers said the United States was not the only country to take a beating from Sandy, reminding the Senate that some other affected countries do not have the infrastructure to bounce back quickly after such a storm.</p>\n<p>Another proposed project dealt with Isla Vista’s lack of appropriate lighting. Off-Campus Senators Alex Choate and Kaitlyn Christianson are working on a resolution to make I.V. brighter, which they defended at the meeting. Christianson said the resolution, which entails filing a work order for each defunct bulb in I.V., is a simple solution to a pressing issue.</p>\n<p>“[This is] something that we’ve needed for years and it [has] not [been] able to get done because of funding,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Senators discussed Proposition 30 and the consequences that would accompany its failure, as they have at every meeting for the past few weeks. There will be continued efforts to advocate Proposition 30’s significance to the student body before Tuesday’s election.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/","id":3102,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3101,3100,3099],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Students can then use these lists to find contact information for books they need.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the student-run textbook marketplace is a kickoff for what the A.S. Office of the President hopes will eventually become an institutionalized series of regular student-run buy-back events at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a process, but still, it’s something we’re going to start now,” Armen said. “Buying books is expensive, and we have no control over return for books. There’s pressure with costs everywhere, so this way students can make profits instead of having to go through a middleman or to the university.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board are also engineering a student-run textbook website structured similarly to the textbook advertising hosted on many Facebook group pages.</p>\n<p>“We’re tying to make a mechanism that is like Facebook, but student-run,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>UCen Bookstore employee and third-year biopsychology major Debbie Gee said the marketplace threatens to redirect students and revenue away from the campus’s main textbook retailer.</p>\n<p>“It might detract from the amount of traffic in the UCen,” Gee said. “When people buy textbooks they also buy other things, like pens, pencils and notebooks. So if they buy from somewhere else, sales in general could potentially go down, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the book buy-back will allow students to bypass bookstores and exchange reading material in a much more efficient manner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is, when we consistently go to the university or small companies, books can get expensive because you don’t have other options,” Armen said. “This came out of student organization. We’re creating innovative ideas when the university is putting a burden on our backs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Elizabeth Dang said the traditional process of buying and reselling schoolbooks is time-consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>“When I sought out the buying back process, I would find that buyback prices would be for only 20 percent of the book, which is practically nothing,” Dang said. “And textbook costs are ridiculous — especially since we only use it nine weeks, and in most of my classes we only read two chapters out of like 500 pages.”</p>\n<p>While the bookstore does offer the option to rent books for a cheaper price, Gee said a successful student-run textbook marketplace could end up being a worthy competitor to the university.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure how the prices at this thing will compare to bookstore prices, but lots of students are struggling with finances, and this could detract from sales if it ends up being cheap, efficient and well-run,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board hope the textbook marketplace fuels widespread questioning and analysis regarding the causes of high textbook prices and promotes further student organization to address shared financial issues.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we’re here: inspiring students, making [them a] part of the solution on campus and showing the impact of having things student-run,” Armen said. “We are a community sharing resources.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/","id":3103,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3102,3101,3100],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
