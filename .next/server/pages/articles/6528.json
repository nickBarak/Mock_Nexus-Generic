As for someone such as Jane Gottlieb,  a simple photograph will not suffice, seeing as she takes further steps in order to intensify the result. On Thursday evening, April 26, the walls of the AD&amp;A Museum at UCSB were wrapped in some of the glorious works crafted by the hands of Gottlieb as she stood amongst peers, family and students in preparation to give her lecture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the discussion many questions arose from those in attendance seeing as her work sparks much curiosity. Unlike many photographs, Gottlieb’s exemplifies some of the complexities of photo taking. Her art is saturated with illuminating colors which pop at first glance. The eccentricity of such radiant elements serve to be symbolic of the emotions which surge through the moments which she captures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fusion of colors which represent deep sentiments, Gottlieb pushes to draw more attention to them. Gottlieb further explained how one of her pieces is a manifestation of these concepts. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist said to the crowd, “This is me trying to recreate the energy which you get when looking down from the Eiffel Tower, which isn’t there, positive energy really.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such an idea can come across as being very unusual but Gottlieb does well in proving through her work how the intricacy of adding her unique modifications polish the vision which she has.

When asked how many copies she had of a specific project she responded, “probably around 40.” Despite there being several emulations of one original piece she clarified that each one remains unique. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82806\" style=\"width: 284px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"768796233\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82803\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82806\" data-attachment-id=\"82806\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/jane-gottliebs-colorful-world/download-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?fit=274%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"274,184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"download-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?fit=274%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82806\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?resize=274%2C184\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?w=274&amp;ssl=1 274w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/download-1.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jane Gottlieb</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process which Gottlieb goes through is unorthodox in and of itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As she puts it, “Materially they are photographs but contextually it’s a painting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most conventional step in her process is when Gottlieb captures the photo. She shared how for a long period of time she was originally interested in painting and then her passion strayed more towards photography. Her roots in painting are what elicited some of the first pieces Gottlieb created where she would use retouching dye on top of actual printed pieces. After some time she took to introduce introducing some digital elements which allow her to further develop her innovations, through doing so she has adapted an illustrious portfolio of intimate art pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon entering the building, booklets which showcase some of her many projects were handed out. The event was geared towards being an exhibition for her art which revolved around France.

A diverse crowd of teachers, students and adults packed the room, leaving very little space to encompass any further persons. A table and four microphones adorned the stage, patiently waiting for the presence of Black Panther members Emory Douglas and Akinsanya Kambon. Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Black Panthers, the revolutionaries spoke on how they employed art as a way to reflect the struggles and cultural history of African Americans and their rebellion to the oppression in their society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd anxiously awaited Douglas to take the stage as Professor Diane Fujino began the event. Introducing an atmosphere of solidarity and cross cultural support, a group of indigenous Chumash Indians took to the stage to thank and honor the speakers for their attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emory Douglas took to the stage, his presence so intense that the room echoed silence, and his first words rang powerfully through the ears of his listeners, “All power to the people!”; this was recited back to him with a fervor that matched those protesting the streets of IV. He introduced his position within the party, the Minister of Culture, as he played a video of the Panthers detailing his role. Douglas had constructed iconic images, that embodied the Black Panther Party’s persona of the militant and revolutionary poor, one that resonated with and began to define the insurgent minority. A powerpoint of his art plastered the vast screen behind him, allowing the audience to fully experience his art. Douglas spoke of a widely unknown narrative, one seldom affiliated with the panthers: the community work the Panthers engaged in and the role his art played in further inciting change. He used his artwork “to enlighten, to educate and to inform” the community through the BPP’s newspaper– he worked “to create a culture of resistance” in his community. His art flashed across the screen behind him, branding the social commentary into the minds of his viewers. The stark images, in very little color, told stories of the social and political climate of the time, some very similar to that of our contemporary world. It was art based on necessity, what was the most impactful, made with the resources they had. As Douglas finished, the audience erupted into swarm of cheers and clapping as he left the stage.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Devin Clark thought the event was awesome. “I didn’t know what to expect, but it was so enlightening.” When asked what was taken from the conversations, Clark replied “they played their part and now it’s our time and our responsibility to do our part”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd calmed down, Akinsanya Kambon walked up the to the stage and proclaimed “art must be used to uplift and educate humanity”.

His words, raw and unrestrained, were so powerful and inspiring, that his speech was continually interrupted by cheers from the audience. He spoke of the importance of culture and heritage and how that inspired his art. He spoke of how the BPP educated him, influencing the construction of his famous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Panther Coloring Book. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next part of the event was a “conversation with the artists”, Douglas and Kambon talked with Professors Diane Fujino and Felice Blake. They covered questions of how the BPP utilized and taught literacy, the influences of their art and the international reach of the Black Panther Party, comparing these to the issues today. The audience hung onto each word, dripping with eagerness to ask their own questions to the revolutionaries. Finally the questions were opened to all and a sea of hands sprang up; many were anxious with inquiry. Topics concerning Colin Kaepernick, imperialism and Donald Trump’s presidency arose, along with more broad questions of how to create political and social change, how to dismantle the oppressive systems and the purpose of protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The event was concluded as Emiliano Martinez, a representative of the American Indian Movement, played an honoring song to the Panther members, creating a lasting atmosphere of solidarity. UCSB student Kate Thorsland really enjoyed the event and was glad she came out. “It really resonated with me because of what is going on politically right now. Movements like this are deemed “radical” but are necessary. This event was definitely well timed for me as unfortunately the same issues are happening now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Multicultural Center then hosted a reception afterwards to honor the artwork created by both Douglas and Kambon. I was able to speak to Kambon and ask him what advice he would give to UCSB students looking to create change. “Organize and change the world,” he said, “don’t worry about politicians, they’re a part of the system that wants to keep the status quo. Change is up to you”.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/","id":6525,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6524,6523,6522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"MCA Project Brings Modern Art to Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Visual Art","publish_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Runaway” serves as a beacon for curious Isla Vista residents, bringing them together to appreciate art and to provoke discussion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Driving or walking along Camino Del Sur, you will probably notice an eye-catching pop of color against the flat, open field of Elings Park. Three structures, geometric mazes of criss-crossing metal, stand together in the middle of Isla Vista. They blend in with the eccentric creativity of the community with their vibrancy, yet they simultaneously create an atmosphere of mystery and wonder with their abstract shape. Those who venture closer will discover not only the intricacy of the sculptures, but also the unifying message that they convey.</p>\n<p>A simple wooden sign next to the structures reveals that the display is called “Runaway,” designed by Greg Corso and Molly Hunker. The piece is part of a project by the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara called takepart/makeart: arte para todos, in which artists Cruz Ortiz, Tanya Aguiñiga and desertArtLAB host artistic programs in various places around Santa Barbara. The project is a response to recent cuts made to arts programs in the state and in the rest of the country, seeking to unite artists and art-lovers alike.</p>\n<p>The project is made to be inclusive and bilingual with certain portions of the explanatory sign next to the structures in Spanish. According to the project description, the “Runaway” sculptures “serve as a central meeting point and information hub” and that “’Runaway’ becomes a beacon around which programming by artists … will take place.” The piece has been moved around the Santa Barbara and Isla Vista areas and will be standing in Elings Park until May 30.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>From far away, the sculptures look like elaborate jungle gyms, conveying a sense of fun and childishness. The bright pink, blue and yellow colors of the metal also contribute to this playful and bubbly atmosphere. The idea seems simple at first glance, but there is an unusual quality to the structures in that their sleek modernity and abstract geometric shape stands out sharply. This quality of the sculptures is meant to draw spectators in by contrasting with the traditional Spanish architecture so prevalent in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77570\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1043473325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77569\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77570\" data-attachment-id=\"77570\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/take-part-make-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"take part make art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77570\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/take-part-make-art.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77570\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara</p></div>\n<p>Once viewers get close to the structures, they can see the intricacy of the grids of metal inside and can explore the ways in which the structures change from different angles. The first two structures allow people to see through the grids in many places due to their rectangular shape and from different perspectives, they create an optical illusion that looks like they are blurring. The third structure is made of various triangle shapes that overlap slightly with an impressive grid of diagonal bars inside that creates complicated patterns.</p>\n<p>UCSB third-year and avid painter Diane Escobedo walked around the sculptures with me, bending down and tilting her head in different ways to admire the play on perspective of each structure.</p>\n<p>“With this piece, you have to get close to it in order to actually be able to see the work that went into it and to understand the complexity. You have to see it in person and interact with it,” Escobedo said.</p>\n<p>She related this quality and the shape of the sculptures to the place of art in our society today.</p>\n<p>“These sculptures make you realize that you can’t just dismiss art at first glance. If you face the sculpture at a certain angle, it looks small and narrow, in the way that many people see art with a narrow mindset. But if you step around to another side, you see that it’s much bigger and more impressive than you realized.”</p>\n<p>“Runaway” serves as a beacon for curious Isla Vista residents, bringing them together to appreciate art and to provoke discussion. It is a way for art to be accessible to all and a celebration of modern art in a time when its value is being questioned. Its simplicity inspires exploration and different ideas about its message. There are many angles, both literal and metaphorical, from which to view the project, allowing everyone and anyone to take part in the experience.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/mca-project-brings-modern-art-to-santa-barbara/","id":6526,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6525,6524,6523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Evan Tan: In Living Color","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Visual Art","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.27.12-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.27.12-AM.png?resize=803%2C605&ssl=1","description":"Rather than hiding in the darkness, Tan has a penchant for illuminating the world with saturated color.

Through the lens, Tan chronicles the compelling stories of people and artists of color within a fluorescent world. The dreamy content of the images are all credited to the 17-year-old Tan, who travels with his cameras to document the scenes he immerses himself in. In an era when many of the emerging talent are late 90s and 2000s babies, Evan Tan is moving toward the forefront of the spectrum, creating a world that chooses to illuminate flaws rather than mask them. Evan Tan spoke to Artsweek about his goal to display people of all shades, capturing the humanity in his subjects and how music shapes the way he engages with his camera.</p>\n<p>Tan’s first venture into the world of photography started with filmmaking.</p>\n<p>“I started off my artistic career in filmmaking,” he said. “I left high school and the country to work on a student-led documentary in Nepal as a cinematographer.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

In response to this thought, Tan said, “I believe everyone has interesting lives; I just capture moments of mine. Everything you see is my real honest life. I don’t think about planning much, I just live my life and whatever happens happens.”</p>\n<p>When we find ourselves in a pivotal moment of our lives, we often lack the comfort and talent to capture these grand times.  Tan is known to carry around four bags with him at all times, stating, “I usually have my camera within a few feet from me at all times, but I like to give her a break sometimes. I treat my camera like I’m in a relationship with it. Sometimes it won’t work and then we’ll both fight and not talk for a while, and then I’ll pick it up and we’ll get back to working together.”</p>\n<p>Embedding oneself into the world of capturing artists when they are off the stage on which they perform is a rarity, yet Tan has etched his place in the world of capturing iconic photos of his artist friends. The magic within his photos lies in his naturalistic approach, in that he aims to show facets of his subjects that other photographers would conceal.</p>\n<p>“I love blemishes. I love imperfections and things that make anyone different,” states Tan, “I want my art to be honest, and I believe that people are the most beautiful in their natural state.”</p>\n<p>“I look at my photography as if I live inside my own universe where I’m the only one with the ability to see. Colors, people, places and shapes are constantly being filtered through my mind, and I use those to create images.” Tan creates an atmosphere with his subjects that allows individuals to display their carefree elements.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76889\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1576600177\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76886\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76889\" data-attachment-id=\"76889\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/evan-tan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=1276%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1276,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"evan tan 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?fit=888%2C668&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76889 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2-250x188.jpg?resize=250%2C188\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-2.jpg?w=1276&amp;ssl=1 1276w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Evan Tan</p></div>\n<p>For example, Tan recently photographed his friend, singer-songwriter Steve Lacy of The Internet, on the set of his “Ryd/Dark Red” music video. On the topic of the spontaneity of capturing the unfiltered moments with Steve on film, Tan said, “I texted him and then he dropped a pin and I just showed up and hung out for, like, half an hour. I just shoot my friends, and a lot of them happen to be artists. I record people in moments in my life, and I allow everything to naturally fall into place; I don’t like planning much.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the most iconic photograph he has ever taken, Tan considered his work and said, “The most iconic moment I have ever shot would be this photo I have of Jaden Smith. He had his Super 8 with him and we hiked this mountain in Calabasas, and I took a photo of him shooting me. The sky is a perfect color and the full moon is visible just over his head; it’s a perfect photo.”</p>\n<p>The romantic essence of shooting on 35mm film provides valuable glimpses into scenarios one would want to escape to and relive.</p>\n<p>“I think shooting on film is the most romantic thing. It’s a relationship that exists between the photographer and the subject that none else in the world can have,” he said, adding, “When you’re shooting on film, every exposure costs something, so every moment is intense and is intertwined with each other.”</p>\n<p>Rather than hiding in the darkness, Tan has a penchant for illuminating the world with saturated color.</p>\n<p>“I love working with naturally found bright colors. I find this wide selection of colors in people and my everyday surroundings. I shot one roll of black-and-white film a while back, but I realized after developing that I would stick with color forever,” the photographer said.</p>\n<p>Music defines our individuality and existence, and the vessel of music in Tan’s life influences the physicality of his content. On the coexistence of music and his photography, he affirmed, “I listen to music every day almost at all times. Most of my friends are involved with music, too, so I’m surrounded by it constantly. I listen to different types of music when I want to feel different emotions and take photos with those feelings in mind.”</p>\n<p>Tan’s nonconformity allows him to relish in individuality. When asked about the differences between him and other photographers, Tan replied, “I think the difference between me and other photographers is that I do this one 100 percent because I enjoy doing this. I don’t make any money, I don’t have a job, I don’t plan things out; photography has become something I can use to express myself in infinite different ways.” He then said, in a moment of clarity, “A lot of people make art to make money or to be like someone else, but eventually, creatively, they will run dry.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76888\" style=\"width: 213px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"521014248\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76886\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76888\" data-attachment-id=\"76888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/evan-tan-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=750%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,925\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"evan tan 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?fit=750%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1-203x250.jpg?resize=203%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?resize=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/evan-tan-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Evan Tan</p></div>\n<p>As for Tan’s goals in the future, he said, “Thom Yorke is a dream of mine to shoot, but I really want to shoot Frank Ocean.” Many photographers’ mass goal is to gravitate attention to their photos to usurp more opportunities, but he when someone views Tan’s images, “I want [viewers] to fall in love with me.”His age should not discredit his self-made accomplishments; he holds remarkable wisdom about the art of photography. His varied subjects are given a medium to be visible so that their beauty shines through the lens. Tan captures not only the heartbeat of Los Angeles but also the heartbeat of people whose faces remain invisible in magazines.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76886\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76886\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/evan-tan-in-living-color/","id":6527,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6526,6525,6524],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
