Wiggins has since been released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first report of a residential burglary came in around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) Sergeant Daniel Calderon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the police arrived at the location, the woman who reported the burglary also “located items stolen from her home inside of a Dodge Ram truck that was parked in front of her residence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After approaching Wiggins, Scypino and Williams, who were near the truck, police arrested the three. Police then located more of the woman’s stolen property in the three suspects’ backpacks, along with additional property that had been stolen in a separate burglary earlier that morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victims of the early morning burglary “reported that they were at home asleep while that crime occured.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, police tied together four burglaries that happened in I.V. over the course of the weekend, according to SBSO Sergeant Jarom Kemp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When deputies started inventorying recovered property, they were able to link many of the burglaries together,” Kemp said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some cases, entry into the dwelling was forced. In others, they gained entry by knowing ‘friends of friends.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the items stolen were electronics, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of the burglaries raised concern about the chaos of move-out weekend in I.V., as many students tend to leave their doors unlocked during the process and out-of-town visitors are not uncommon due to graduation ceremonies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students took to the Facebook group Free &amp; For Sale to warn people about the burglaries, while others discussed the hectic nature that comes with UCSB’s graduation since many students’ leases in I.V. end around that same weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One I.V. landlord who runs </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/from-dp-rentals-to-playa-life-i-v-40-isla-vista-properties-under-new-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playa Life I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Erin Eliza, posted on Facebook about move-out weekend, calling it a “toxic environment” and “Christmas for Criminals.” She also called for UCSB to have more authority over move-in weekend, referencing the university’s restrictions during Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted in the comments on her post that “1⁄2 the homes we own have had their bikes etc stolen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stolen property collected by police from the three suspects is being held at the I.V.

It is typical for students to already be proficient piano players when they enter the course.</p>\n<p>Halsted has been working with Tao and two other students, Iris Xie, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, and David Hwang, a material sciences graduate student, since 2016.</p>\n<p>All three students will be graduating this spring.</p>\n<p>Tao and Xie will have the opportunity to play the carillon for approximately ten minutes each before joining their fellow graduates at their respective ceremonies, while Halsted is slated to play during the remaining thirty minutes.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] kinda nervous because there’s actually gonna be a ton of people listening. During the weekend, it’s pretty empty, so it’s less nerve-wracking, I guess,” Tao said. “I definitely have to practice.”</p>\n<p>Currently, the three students trade off playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. During the weekdays, there isn’t a suitable “window of time” where they can practice since classes run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Tao said.</p>\n<p>While most traditional carillon songs are “not really recognizable,” Tao still enjoys playing ones that are more up-tempo because the bells ring more distinctly.</p>\n<p>“[Students] play music written for carillon… arrangements of music for other instruments, their own compositions and arrangements and popular songs that UCSB students like to hear,” Halsted said in an email. “Everyone loves to hear music they already know.”</p>\n<p>“I know someone played the Harry Potter theme, some people played the Pokémon theme song. We, once, last year I think, played the Rick Roll song during April Fools,” Tao said.</p>\n<p>Tao said she decided to audition for Halsted’s class her freshman year after a friend recommended it to her.</p>\n<p>“I thought it would be really cool to be a part of this huge landmark of our school,” Tao said. Before playing the carillon for the first time, Halsted’s students start off on a piano and then transition to a practice keyboard that is similar in structure to the carillon.</p>\n<p>Tao’s 15 years of piano playing translated smoothly to playing the carillon, despite the added component of playing with one’s feet in addition to their hands. The carillon is also played with fists rather than fingers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83469\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83469\" data-attachment-id=\"83469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/bong-bong-bong-the-hands-behind-the-carillon-bells/img_3476/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3476\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83469 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3476.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The carillon differs from the piano in that players use their fists rather then their fingers. They also play some notes with their feet. <em>Sanya Kamidi/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As she’s worked with Halsted over the years, Tao said she believes she has become more intuitive with her sight reading as well as understanding what works for the carillon and what does not.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes certain music is written for the instrument, so it’s easier to play, and then sometimes we take piano music… so sometimes we have to rearrange it,’” Tao said. “Figuring that out… has gotten easier and just figuring out the mechanics of it, too.”</p>\n<p>Tao, Xie and Hwang all went through a certification process to join the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America as Associate Carillonneurs. Over the course of a year, the students worked on submitting both video and audio recordings of their playing, receiving feedback from the judges and using that feedback to improve and resubmit their applications.</p>\n<p>While the students had the ease of working at their own pace throughout this process, Tao recalled how long it took and how eager she was to be certified. She began preparing for the certification during the Winter Quarter of her junior year and was recently certified at the beginning of Winter Quarter this year.</p>\n<p>Halsted’s students were able to travel to UC Berkeley and UC Riverside to play their carillons as well as host UC Berkeley’s Guild for a recital on campus, Tao said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to see them talk about all this… like the history, the people who’ve played it, the music,” Tao said. “There’s actually so much [history] behind it and even so much history behind the people who make the bells.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83467\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83467\" data-attachment-id=\"83467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/bong-bong-bong-the-hands-behind-the-carillon-bells/img_3461/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3461\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83467 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_3461.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three students alternate playing the bells on weekend mornings from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. <em>Sanya Kamidi/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tao reached out to a former carillon student of Halsted’s who now plays at Trinity Cathedral in San Jose, California, Tao’s hometown, and hopes to be able to continue to play the instrument there.</p>\n<p>“I’m just really happy that I had this experience, and it’s something that I’ve done a really long time,” Tao said. “It’s one of the defining activities and memories I have of UCSB.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.6 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Zaveeni Khan-Marcus, who has been the director for the MultiCultural Center (MCC) since its founding, is the “heart and soul” of the center, according to Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life.</p>\n<p>Armistead works with the center in an administrative capacity and has known Khan-Marcus since they were both undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), when the center was first introduced.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of history with Zaveeni and I and with me watching the center grow,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>The MCC was a small room on the other side of campus when it was first founded in 1987 after students of color protested their lack of inclusion within the university. When the University Center expansion was commissioned in 1994, the organization’s current space by Ortega Dining Commons was created.</p>\n<p>Now the center holds a theater, a meeting room and lounge. While the MCC has suffered from limited funding, it has been able to maintain its 24-25 programs each quarter while also increasing the scale on which it operates.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter, we had Kimberle Crenshaw who gave a talk at Campbell Hall, and even though Campbell Hall holds only about 800 seats, we had 1,200 people who showed up for that event,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>She sees this as tangible proof there is demand, and an expectation, for the MCC to continue to host speakers or put on events that create a “platform for conversation about race, class, social justice [and] equality.”</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also works with faculty to create awareness on campus; some faculty members even offer extra credit to students who attend these events.</p>\n<p>The spaces within the MCC are also open to cultural organizations affiliated with the center, which often host meetings or events there.</p>\n<p>“We provide opportunities for UCSB students [to immerse themselves in] other cultural experiences. MCC is definitely the best place to provide such international and cultural communications,” said Takafumi Igarashi, director of social activities for the International Student Association.</p>\n<p>Beyond its existence as an event space, the MCC is focused on giving voice to students.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our 30-year existence currently, centralizing the students is one of the most important things we do,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>The MCC is led by a board of students, staff and faculty. Student representatives come from various cultural organizations that are affiliated with the center.</p>\n<p>“They come together and they have conversations, inform us about what their needs are, but also represent to the campus the needs of … the marginalized students,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>These students are able to have challenging conversations and come together to support each other and advance student activism during a difficult campus climate, according to Armistead.</p>\n<p>While the MCC is typically known as a home away from home for students of color, the center has also opened itself up to transgender students on campus with its Trans* Initiative.</p>\n<p>“In the last couple of years, transgender students have felt comfortable with this space … so that’s saying a lot – it’s a huge statement that they feel comfortable within the walls of this center,” said Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing resources and working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to make UCSB a more inclusive campus, the MCC hosts weekly meetings for “all trans folks and supportive allies,” according to its website.</p>\n<p>However, while the MCC is entering its 30th year of existence, this center is not the norm nationwide.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge statement, that UCSB has had a MultiCultural Center for 30 years. A lot of my colleagues from other campuses feel strongly that this MultiCultural Center is a very important, transformative space,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Other universities trying to follow in UCSB’s footsteps might face pushback from administration or minimal funding and staffing because multicultural centers are identity-based spaces, but Khan-Marcus advises them to continuously advocate for their students.</p>\n<p>“Social justice work is challenging, because it’s not easy work, but it’s absolutely needed at every campus. Even in this day and age, if you go and talk to some students of color, they will share with you that at times that they feel invisible at UCSB,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Lily Pham, Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) co-president, it is heartening to know that there’s someone out there who cares about centers like the MCC.</p>\n<p>“There’s some statistic that if you look it up, it’ll say we’re pretty up there in diversity. But that’s not always prevalent when you’re just walking around and seeing, at a face value, what the campus is,” Pham said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
