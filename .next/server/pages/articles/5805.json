This is not just a new chapter for all of you, but for UCSB and Isla Vista as a whole. This community has changed dramatically in my four years here. Restaurants have come and gone, there are two banks with actual tellers and not just ATMs, and about 1,000 new pizza places. But that’s just I.V.: it’s always changing.</p>\n<p>It’s the ever-shifting nature of Isla Vista that makes us so unique and wonderful to be around, but it is also our biggest weakness. I.V. has an extremely short memory. Things happen here and then we move on as if they never did. I don’t want that to happen. Not anymore.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The final three weeks of my time as a student at UCSB were marred by the tragic events of May 23. As my friends, classmates and I were preparing for finals and graduation; the happiness, stress and anticipation that comes with it all vanished overnight. They were replaced by sadness, pain and confusion. Places I walked by every day to get to class went from familiar and welcoming to strange and distant. I have a heavy heart whenever I walk down Pardall for some food. I hold back tears as I turn onto Seville and pass by the Capri Apartments on my way to get groceries from the Food Co-op. I stare at the candle wax-stained sidewalks where our memorials once lay. It’s been over four months and I.V. has recovered, but not healed.</p>\n<p>All of you new Gauchos are entering into a family that is still in mourning and still broken, as we always will be. There is no mending the wounds we were dealt, or erasing the sadness that overcame us. For you new Gauchos, May 23, 2014 is an abstract date, connected to events you know about but ones you didn’t experience. It’s easier for you to see this day from a distance, but for those of us that were here, it isn’t. I will never forget the panicked texts I got while I was at work. I will never find such relief in seeing a friend post on Facebook, because that proves they’re alive. I will never forget the silence that overcame I.V. on May 24, when I walked with my community through the streets of I.V. — a silence that Hannah-Beth Jackson requested to never hear again as we gathered to mourn. I will always remember the love I felt in each hug that I gave and was given in the days and weeks after. I will always feel the unity that I.V. had. I will always accept the challenge given to us by Richard Martinez: Not One More.</p>\n<p>That is why I am writing this letter to you. Not one more is a mantra that cannot be forgotten or limited to gun violence. UCSB and Isla Vista need to integrate it into all aspects of life. Not one more member of our community should be senselessly gunned down. Not one more member of our community should be sexually assaulted. Not one more time will UCSB be in the news for anything but our accomplishments.</p>\n<p>That’s up to each and every one of you. New and returning. Create the campus and community that reaps greatness. Go out and have fun! Enjoy your time in paradise. But remember to respect one another. Remember that you are not entitled to anything or anyone. We all deserve to be treated as equals. That’s what it means to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p><em>Isaac Villa graduated from UCSB in 2014</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Similar comments littered local message boards in the immediate aftermath of Judge Colleen Sterne’s decision to strike down the Santa Barbara gang injunction — a proposed mandate that would have curtailed the activities of those labeled as gang affiliates. </p>\n<p>It has been two months since Judge Sterne’s ruling and so far none of these predications have been fulfilled. </p>\n<p>Instead, police have identified and apprehended numerous perpetrators of gang crime by doing their jobs: investigating and attending to crime and crime reports. Just this past week, one of the principal leaders of the Sureños gang in Santa Barbara County, Raymond Macias, was sentenced to life without the opportunity for parole based on the combined investigative work of Santa Barbara, Lompoc and Santa Maria police departments. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It is just as easy, in hindsight, to laud a decision that has so far worked out as it is impossible to predict what the outcome will be when a decision must be made. And in the case of organized violence, fear certainly pushes the legislative inclination towards safety at any cost.</p>\n<p>The injunction trial featured examples of public intimidation worthy of a Ray Chandler novel, featuring the cryptically-labeled informant “Mister X,” who claimed the Mexican Mafia, La Eme, was laying low until the gang injunction was struck down. His implication: if the injunction was denied, all hell would break loose.<br>\nTo many, an increased police presence and additional sanctions sounds secure, the idea of “public defenders” guarding their constituents from harm seems like the right measure for those in danger. To protect the innocent, increase the guards and their punishing power. </p>\n<p>Except unlike opposing armies, the common threats to public safety dress like and are embedded in the social life of those who would be protected. Issuing restrictions against appearance and association fails to address any markers of criminality beyond the superficial, thereby creating appearance-based stereotypes that can contribute to unjustified profiling of innocent people. </p>\n<p>As was pointed out multiple times during the injunction trial, police have the tools to defend, and more importantly, work with a specific community. It is sweeping mandates like gang injunctions that help transition that role into the offensive, and into expectations of the police primarily as controllers instead of responders. The response seems reasonable in an area of constant, concentrated violence, but impractical and rife with collateral damage in a community like downtown SB. </p>\n<p>And neither of these roles, controller nor responder, fully meets the challenges posed by a human threat. Police are not robots for a reason. They have the proven capacity to build a dialogue with at-risk individuals, and work over time in an assigned area to prevent a potential threat from escalating into violence.<br>\nRecently, the group PODER (People Organized for the Defense and Equal Rights of SB Youth) has challenged police to respond to allegations of discrimination, and stated that some accused accept long jail sentences or unfair plea deals to avoid antagonizing police. </p>\n<p>Whether or not individual cases are the product of discrimination, the perception and dynamic of distrust do exist, have very real consequences and must be overcome. For many people, the reality is that they would rather forgo disputing convictions or avoid reporting a crime than challenge a system that can do just as much harm as it can good.</p>\n<p>In his closing remarks during the injunction trial, Deputy Public Defender Michael Hanley offered an apt opinion on the philosophy of the public defender, to protect with accountability and full, individualized attention, not to gloss over the rights of civilians and bend the scientific basis upon which injunctions must be crafted just to create the appearance of order. As Hanley stated, unnecessary requirements of police can result in “an iatrogenic effect, where the cure is worse than the disease itself.” </p>\n<p>Santa Barbara does harbor gang violence, it does contain belligerent college-age residents and, as I’ve learned in my commute on the 101, it contains a dangerous population of sports car owners who will risk all of our lives to swerve through commuters like a high-speed obstacle course. The individual policeman carries a burden of continuous adaptability and much of their training is uncompromising — take no chances, take every opportunity to stop crime before it happens.<br>\nBut I think what will be most beneficial for our communities, from the streets of Isla Vista to parks of the Eastside and Westside, is when individual police develop a stronger relationship with individual residents so that prevention takes its most useful form. The success of halting any kind of crime in its tracks largely depends on tips from the community, and a trust in police first as individuals. </p>\n<p>Efforts are already being made, and deserve more attention and participation from residents. Police Officer Adrian Gutierrez will soon begin a one-year local pilot of Gang Resistance Education and Training, G.R.E.A.T, a Department of Defense program effective since 1992.  A June 2012 analysis, supported by a grant from the National Institute of Justice and carried out by the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, reported a 39 percent reduction in odds of gang-joining among students who participated in the G.R.E.A.T. program compared to those who did not, and an average of 24 percent reduction in odds of gang-joining across four years after the program. </p>\n<p>I’ve had extensive experience working with children, including local kids at I.V. Elementary, and I know that kids are open to ideas and that they learn quickly from what they are taught. If they experience positive, diverse methods of support, such as those being championed by PODER downtown, and work with police to understand why people with a gold badge and gun deserve authority over their friends and neighbors who may also have guns, the lives of both police and community members will become gradually safer. </p>\n<p>This lesson carries over to the streets of Isla Vista, where violent assaults have been increasing in recent years. While no one can predict when a machete wielder will turn up in their house or a violent stranger will attack in the dark, increased dialogue between police and the people they serve would go a long way to relieving tensions on both sides. </p>\n<p>Police conferences such as Coffee with a Cop can provide the opportunity for residents to express their concerns and offer invaluable information on the activities police monitor. People who trust individual policemen would feel more comfortable going to report a violent assault or crime, hopefully decreasing the reliance on school intermediaries with an insufficient, or at least rather limited, understanding of the legal system and rights of victims. And when police understand the lives of those they serve, individual officers become better listeners, better responders and better informed about the very unique happenings of their local areas. </p>\n<p>Without the injunction, police are working on specific responses to various known gang activity, and are developing specific solutions to engage the children of these communities. Hopefully, this trend will increase in the coming year and community organizers and public defenders will be able to organize together to educate and learn from one another. </p>\n<p>Violence lurks around every corner, but the increase in the number and type of community events and in the activism of those who would like to see their surroundings change are better investments than sweeping one-sided responses. </p>\n<p>If I had not attended portions of the gang injunction trial and spoken to members of PODER and individual lawyers, I, too, might have thought of the rejected injunction as a lost opportunity.  I can’t stress enough the value of speaking with these different constituents of the complex communities we live in. While I believe many civilians do fear abuse of the law, too few are taking the opportunity to engage with their local law enforcement, many of whom are open to listen. </p>\n<p><em>Suzanne Becker is all about engagement — she’s engaging people left and right.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/","id":5802,"author":{"id":429,"name":"Suzanne Becker"},"related":[5801,5800,5799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Tale of Two Cultures: Harassment Abroad and at Home","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Risa Weber describes the differences between her experiences of harassment in Buenos Aires and in Isla Vista. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Don’t fight the culture. The culture will always win.” These words stuck with me after my on-site orientation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At my pre-departure meeting back in the U.S., past travelers reminded us about safety and cultural differences. Women specifically were advised to avoid smiling or making eye contact with men in the street, as these acts might be interpreted as sexual interest. I was forewarned by many a guidebook and travel blog to ignore the onslaught of catcalls I would hear, which are blamed on machismo culture.</p>\n<p>Since I have been known to accidentally smile at strangers in airports as well sassily snap retorts at people shouting at my group of friends on Del Playa Drive, I took a series of deep breaths and prepared myself for a challenge.</p>\n<p>I’ve now spent four weeks here in Buenos Aires and the catcalling does not disappoint. It’s as if the men on the street feel it’s rude not to comment on girls as they pass by. As my housemate and I moved through a busy crowd near a bus stop, every single one of the men in a long line of workers made a comment as they squeezed past us, carrying boxes of supplies above the crowd. They were practically bored afterthoughts, comments out of habit made mandatory since opting out would have thrown off the rhythm of the group.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I had prepared myself to deflect these catcalls with indifference and avoid stubbornly speaking out about microaggressions that women face every day. But once I was here in this culture that was supposed to surprise me with its objectification, I suddenly didn’t feel the need to give anyone a dirty look for yelling at me the way I did back at home.</p>\n<p>Late to class one day, I walked as fast as I could across the widest avenue in Buenos Aires with a stack of papers and a determined expression when I heard <em>“hola, diosa”</em> from a man nearby. I couldn’t help but think that if I were doing the same thing at night back in I.V., I wouldn’t have gotten a “hello, goddess” but something like, “Why you walking so fast, bitch?”</p>\n<p>While alone in I.V., I’ve been asked by a large group of men if I was scared to walk next to them as I crossed to the other side of the street. (Of course I was.) Take a stroll down DP on Saturday night and you’ll hear, “Why are you walking so fast?” plenty of times, and see more than a few guys insistent on following girls to parties to the point of physically blocking their path.</p>\n<p>This has always frustrated me, but it took a trip to the southern hemisphere to realize it isn’t normal, not even in a society where catcalling is widely accepted.</p>\n<p>Any catcall is unwanted sexual attention, but something about the catcalls in Buenos Aires makes me feel a little more respected than the ones at home — which is an absurd thing to say about a catcall. When someone whispers <em>“che bella”</em> in my ear, it’s creepy, but not inherently threatening.</p>\n<p>The difference between these two kinds of outbursts is that one is objectifying you but leaving you alone, while the other is objectifying, threatening and expecting to get something out of it. The latter is more sinister because it’s a reminder that the person yelling thinks you owe them something whether it’s a smile, a conversation or a sexual act. This is not lighthearted flirting. This is harassment, and it is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>I could try to fight our culture, but I wouldn’t win. We are too strong to be fought singlehandedly. We are a community that perseveres and thrives, that loves and stays with its residents long after they leave. But we can change and we do change. And I believe that we can become a community that respects everyone’s right to live without being intimidated or receiving unwanted sexual attention, advances or assaults.</p>\n<p>It starts with the realization that, when someone hears a catcall, in the back of their mind they are hoping it won’t be followed by violence. It starts with the realization that women are subjected to this fear routinely. It starts with the realization that to be an ally to women it’s not enough to respect your friends who are girls.</p>\n<p>I know that you love your sister or your girlfriend or your mother or your female housemates. I know that you hope they get home okay. I know you’d want them to feel safe walking down their street. But that’s not enough. Until you can treat women you don’t know with respect and encourage others to do so as well, nothing will change.</p>\n<p><em>Risa Weber thinks a healthy dose of respect is the best medicine.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/a-tale-of-two-cultures-harassment-abroad-and-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/a-tale-of-two-cultures-harassment-abroad-and-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/a-tale-of-two-cultures-harassment-abroad-and-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/a-tale-of-two-cultures-harassment-abroad-and-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/a-tale-of-two-cultures-harassment-abroad-and-at-home/","id":5803,"author":{"id":464,"name":"Risa Weber"},"related":[5802,5801,5800],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dysfunctional Districts","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Matthew Meyer explains the major problems with the process of drawing up congressional districts.

They respond most directly to the needs of the people who elect them. This divided focus begins to explain the ridiculous gap between the aforementioned polls. But the mere existence of districts is not the only institutional factor at play. In the case of the House, partisan manipulation of district boundaries also largely contributes to this discrepancy.</p>\n<p>The House of Representatives is elected by congressional districts, which are subdivisions of the states they represent. Looking at a map divided by these districts is reminiscent of cloud gazing — the subdivisions take a wide variety of shapes. Illinois’ fourth district looks like a pair of earmuffs. Maryland’s third is a Rorschach splotch or a pinwheel, depending on who you ask.</p>\n<p>The districts don’t contort themselves in such bizarre ways because the officials who draw them have a sense of humor. Sometimes the congressional subdivisions are deformed to accommodate geographical realities. More often, they are drawn to create voter blocs with specific attributes. The creation of these ideological pockets is called “gerrymandering,” and these blocs are used to give a party or individual the advantage in gaining representation in that region.</p>\n<p>Gerrymandering is particularly effective in countries with non-proportional representation, featuring only two dominant parties. Sound like anyone we know? In America’s non-proportional system, only the candidate who wins a plurality of a race’s votes gains representation.  Using this “first-past-the-post” format, elections for individual state legislatures result in either Republican or Democratic dominance.</p>\n<p>What do state elections have to do with gerrymandering? Their legislatures, dominated by a single party, are in charge of drawing and re-drawing district boundaries in most states. That’s what you call a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>While they must fit certain guidelines, district parameters allow plenty of room for a state’s dominant faction to create a partisan advantage. The “earmuffs” of Illinois, for example, were designed by Democrats to create a Hispanic supermajority for Representative Luis Gutierrez. Since 1993, Gutierrez has dominated elections, never gaining less than 75 percent of his district’s votes.<br>\nGerrymandering is utilized for more than the creation of favorable districts for a party’s incumbents. Two of the most common forms of the technique actually involve creating districts for a party’s opponent.</p>\n<p>“Packing” is a strategy by which parties concentrate many voters of one type into a single district. Thus, for one seat, the bloc’s support is overwhelming, but the group ultimately impacts significantly fewer House races. Legislators would rather forfeit a single region than risk the bloc’s opposition in multiple districts.</p>\n<p>“Cracking” is another form of gerrymandering that achieves the same effect by similarly manipulative means. Rather than forcing all of an opposing faction into one district, cracking attempts to split a powerful voter bloc into as many districts as possible. Taking advantage of the “wasted vote effect,” the party creates divisions that do not give the faction enough voters in any one district to gain a plurality. Even if this population is large and impassioned, America’s non-proportional system will leave them unrepresented unless they can dominate individual districts.</p>\n<p>Some states, including California, are beginning to combat these strategies by taking the power of re-districting away from politicians. After passing laws that delegated the task to an external committee instead, California’s representatives saw a significant turnover in 2012. Other states have passed similar reforms, but an overwhelming majority still allow politicians to control the creation of their districts.</p>\n<p>Gerrymandering allows the House of Representatives to choose its voters — not the other way around. This is problematic for obvious reasons. While Americans are clearly disenchanted with the actions of Congress, they fail to hold their own district’s representative accountable. In 2012, <em>OpenSecrets.org</em> reported a 90 percent incumbent re-election rate for the House. For over 50 years this number has never dropped below 85 percent. This November, that is unlikely to change.</p>\n<p>For congressional incumbents, re-election is already a breeze. To help overcome a challenger, the legislators have an insurmountable advantage in campaign funding, wide name recognition and the right friends in Washington. When handed a cookie-cutter district filled with constituents of the same ideology, the congressman or woman needs only to pander to their region’s needs for assured re-election.</p>\n<p>This brings us to where we stand today. Congress is filled with career politicians responsive only to the desires of their party and their specific district. Particularly in the House, the divided focus of representatives slows national-scale decisions to a crawl.</p>\n<p>The casualty is the American voter. The politicians we elect abuse our non-proportional system to waste our votes. Large, impassioned groups that deserve widespread influence are reduced to a single representative. Even worse, these groups are sometimes divided to the point that they gain no representation at all. The rest of the population remains blissfully unaware — constantly re-electing their district’s representative who suits their needs just fine.</p>\n<p>States who delegate re-districting to external committees have taken a step in the right direction. However, many of these reforms are weak and grant state legislature appointment and oversight privileges. The focus should now turn to further reducing politician’s access to these commissions. For the rest of the country it is time to wrest control from their state’s legislators and hand it to officials who do not have a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p><em>Matthew Meyer says no to cracking, packing, stacking and macking and you should, too.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the 10/2/14 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.
