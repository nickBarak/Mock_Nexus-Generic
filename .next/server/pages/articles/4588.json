The Tenants’ Association is calling upon the university, Residential Services and the Office of the President (UCOP) to end all future rent increases.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, Director of Business and Financial Planning at H&amp;RS, said family student housing rent increases three percent each year, according to the department’s long-term rent plan. These increases correspond to operating costs such as labor costs and utilities, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker said the Tenants’ Association initially requested, in March 2014, that the university freeze rent for West Campus during the two-year construction of the Sierra Madre apartments. He said the university and the Tenants’ Association both agreed to this proposal, with a stipulation that the rates raise to fit the long-term plan at the end of the two-year period.</p>\n<p>Now that construction for Sierra Madre apartments is complete, the proposed 9.2 percent rent increase for West Campus Family Student Housing makes up for the two years of frozen rent, according to H&amp;RS officials. Combined with the annual three percent increase, this will amount to a 12.2 percent increase.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parfrey, Tenants’ Association Board president and a West Campus resident, said the Tenants’ Association’s goal is to encourage the housing department to improve the living quality at family student housing, not to “shame” the university.</p>\n<p>“There’s all this investment going on around us and no significant money being put into our living conditions, other than getting things up to code, which in my opinion is not an improvement to the amenities,” said Parfrey, third-year environmental studies and biological anthropology double major.</p>\n<p>“The three percent is standard … it happens not just in family housing; it happens in all of our residential units,” said Jessica Fougere, placement service manager of housing and residential services. “So there’s always a percentage increase; because everything goes up in cost each year, the cost of anybody living anywhere goes up.”</p>\n<p>Residents of university-owned housing have voiced concern over the rent increase and explained that issues such as unsanitary living conditions, outdated plumbing and inadequate kitchenware should invalidate higher costs for student families.</p>\n<p>“It infuriates me to think us students who come here with our families . . . have to live in these conditions, whether we like it or not, because it’s all that’s available to us in the affordable housing shortage of [Isla Vista] and larger Santa Barbara area,” said Jessica Foster, a fifth-year environmental studies major and West Campus resident, in an email.</p>\n<p>“West Campus is a half-dilapidated, subpar housing complex for student families,” said Brian Griffith, a graduate student who lives on West Campus. “We have lead-based paint in our homes. We have dirty water . . . We have, and have had, construction all around us for several years … If anything, these deteriorating living conditions deserve a rent decrease. So the least housing can do is freeze our rental rates as they are.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A featured image initially showed West Campus Faculty Housing, it now shows West Campus Family Housing.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pescadero Lofts, built in 2014 at 761 Camino Pescadero for nearly $10 million, brought 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the street. Managers are planning to house several more this year. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A new count and survey shows a slight increase in the number of homeless in Isla Vista from last year but a decrease of nearly 50 percent since 2013.</p>\n<p>The survey by the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness (C3H) was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Pescadero Lofts, a nearly $10 million complex that opened in 2014 to bring 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the streets.</p>\n<p>Volunteers, many of whom were UC Santa Barbara students, counted 19 homeless people in I.V. this April using a smartphone app to determine their “vulnerability score” based on questions about income, health, substance abuse and duration of homelessness.</p>\n<p>This year’s count is up slightly from 13 in January 2015 — a month after the lofts opened — but is a significant decrease from 34 in 2013.</p>\n<p>One reason the number of homeless may have increased from last year is that all of the previous year’s surveys (2011, 2013, 2015) were conducted in January when it is colder, while this year’s survey took place in April.</p>\n<p>The most recent survey, however, was conducted over a smaller area than in past years, spanning from UCSB to the Devereux Lagoon and from El Colegio Road to the beach, omitting the Ellwood area in Goleta for the first time.</p>\n<p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, volunteers were instructed to approach people they believed were homeless, report the person’s current location and ask where they had slept the previous night. People who said they slept outside of I.V. were not counted in the survey.</p>\n<p>“For us to really be able to help people, we need to know who they are, where they are and what they need,” said Luke Barrett, the regional coordinator for C3H in South Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>C3H will select up to 10 of I.V.’s most vulnerable homeless and move them into permanent housing, either in the Pescadero Lofts or at other locations such as Friendship Manor or veteran housing.</p>\n<p>Chuck Flacks, executive editor of C3H, said I.V. poses unique obstacles to organizations helping the homeless because some people come to I.V. with little more than the clothes on their back.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has historically been a community of openness — almost an experimental community,” Flacks said. “Since the ‘60s and before, I.V. was a kind of utopian place. There are plenty of people who kind of come to Isla Vista to just be in this utopian environment.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Ferraez, on-site resident manager for the Pescadero Lofts, said that I.V. has a “unique chronic homeless population,” noting that I.V. is 15 miles from the nearest shelter despite the fact that I.V.’s homeless are more likely to have mental health issues than those in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There are people living [in the lofts] or on the waiting list who truly don’t want to live downtown and don’t feel supported downtown,” Ferraez said. “They are isolated from all supportive services besides the I.V. Clinic.”</p>\n<p>Ferraez said there is an “overrepresentation of chronic alcoholism” in I.V.’s homeless population, something she said may be due to the “high accessibility of alcohol in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The smartphone survey allows C3H to help I.V.’s unique homeless population by quantifying the vulnerability of each homeless person in I.V. Barrett said this “evidence-based” approach gives the homeless “leverage against the system and the bureaucratic nightmare of low-income housing.”</p>\n<p>Many of the initial 35 people placed in the lofts in 2014 were chronic drug users, Barrett said, and are now doing “tremendously better.” He attributes this to the housing itself, but also the access to food, social care, health care and mental health services that the lofts provide.</p>\n<p>Barrett said the fact that the homeless population is still far below its 2013 level is evidence against the idea that if you build services like the Pescadero Lofts, homeless people will come to the area. However, Barrett said there is still much to be done to make sure all homeless people in I.V. have access to the services they need.</p>\n<p>“We know there are some people out there for sure and we have got to figure out how to help them,” Barrett said. “We need to know their names, to know what they look like, to know their needs.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kaitlyn Tang contributed reporting</em></strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/","id":4585,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[4584,4583,4582],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Adopt-A-Block Volunteers Clean up I.V.

in recent years, resulting in a less devastating aftermath of pollution in the small, oceanside area. This year, an approximate 250 volunteers assembled at 11 a.m. to clean up I.V. — a considerably smaller group than the 349 volunteers in 2015 and 367 in 2014, but just as successful as in previous years.</p>\n<p>Most volunteers tend to be I.V. residents who want to keep their neighborhood clean, according to Adam Portè, Adopt-A-Block supervisor. “Unfortunately, a lot of the times the people that were partying here on Saturday night are gone by Sunday morning,” said Portè, who was pleased to see the work completed in two hours after posting pictures online of the 66 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69346\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69346\" data-attachment-id=\"69346\"

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Businesses are worried that they will be negatively impacted by power outages due to their forced closures. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista business owners and managers shared their experiences with the Nexus this week regarding the recent power outages amidst stormy weather in the Goleta area.</p>\n<p>Many local businesses have reported losing all electricity with the onset of El Niño storms. On Jan. 5, for example, strong winds damaged infrastructure and caused a power outage throughout I.V.’s downtown business district that lasted several hours, and smaller power outages have followed. In such circumstances, many businesses report having to close stores until power is restored.</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen said the co-op lost at least half of its sales on Jan. 5 as the result of a power outage that rendered the store closed for five hours. According to Cohen, the store averages about $10,000 a day in sales, but it only made about $5,000 on Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>“It’s very hard to have to sit at the entrance of your business and say, ‘Sorry there’s no power,’” Cohen said. “That was stressful and our sales that day really suffered.”</p>\n<p>Otaco manager and third-year sociology student Richard Kim said the restaurant loses money during power outages, especially when the blackouts occur at night.</p>\n<p>“It does affect our numbers because we sell beer and beer sells better at night,” Kim said. “It hurts financially.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Drip owner Tom Leu, however, the power outage saved his restaurant money because business was already slow during recent storms and the loss of power allowed him to send employees home.</p>\n<p>“That was a perfect time for a power outage,” Leu said.</p>\n<p>Aladdin Café employee Steven Abdulhai, whose family owns the restaurant, said his family will usually check in with their neighboring restaurant Woodstock’s Pizza to determine whether or not to close during power outages.</p>\n<p>“We like to keep ourselves updated with Woodstock’s — we’re cool with the employees there,” Abdulhai said. “If it’s not too serious for them to be closing, then we’ll probably stay open.”</p>\n<p>Buddha Bowls owner Daniel Dunietz said the “real issue” with power outages is maintaining food temperatures. According to Dunietz, the loss of power shuts down refrigeration, which can cause food to spoil over a certain period of time.</p>\n<p>“There is a fair amount of built-in insulation, but we still watch those temperatures slowly rise,” Dunietz said. “Once it gets past a certain point, [the food] becomes dangerous, and if it stays at that point for some time, you have to throw out everything.”</p>\n<p>Dunietz said he instructs his employees to keep the coolers closed to preserve the cool air inside in case of outages.</p>\n<p>“We have a protocol where you just don’t open the cooler, because it is insulated so it can keep that temperature cool for almost six to eight hours,” Dunietz said.</p>\n<p>Dunietz said Southern California Edison has usually had a quick response time to damaged infrastructure during storms.</p>\n<p>“The guys at Edison have been really awesome, so I’ve been giving them coupons and stuff,” Dunietz said. “They bust their ass.”</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, power outages have some positive results.</p>\n<p>“The beauty of those power outage days is that celebration when the power goes back on,” Cohen said. “We can invite our people back into our store.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/recent-power-outages-impact-local-eateries/","id":4587,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4586,4585,4584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
