UCSB also shot 6-12 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did a pretty good job of shot selection and getting ourselves to the rim,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[Cal Poly] had an uncharacteristically bad shooting night from three and that gave us some separation in the game. We didn’t live at the three point line, we had some patience about getting the better shot and that’s when I think we’re a better team.”</p>\n<p>Never trailing at any point in Saturday’s game, it was the Gauchos’ fifth time in the last six games in which they led from start to finish. Santa Barbara has also held its opponents to a 35.8 shooting percentage during its eight-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward John Green had arguably his best performance of the season. Leading the Gauchos’ second unit, Green finished his final home game in dramatic fashion tallying in his first double-double of the year with a team-high 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Being able to bring John off the bench has been an unbelievable benefit to this team,” Williams said. “How efficient John has been the last two weeks takes us to a whole other level. People have to guard everywhere on the floor.”</p>\n<p>An uphill battle for last year’s Honorable Mention, Green missed all but four games his first three years under Coach Williams. Battling a series of foot, wrist and knee injuries, the redshirt senior has worked his way back to health and emerged as a major vocal point off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I look at my [injuries] as a learning experience,” Green said. “I just want to be a living testament for people and let him know that if you really love something don’t quit on it.”</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.7 points per game in the last three games, all of which he has led or come second on the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe had a strong senior night performance as well. The two combined for 17 of UCSB’s 20 points in the paint along with six rebounds apiece. After a few stagnant possessions on offense, Beeler beat his man down the lane and connected on a go-ahead dunk from freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak giving the Gauchos a 53-42 lead. This provided UCSB with much needed momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun playing especially when [me and Mitch] are productive,” Beeler said. “We work against each other every day so it’s great to see that work pay off for the both of us.”</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor and Dajuan Smith played some quality minutes and made an effect around the perimeter. Smith also contributed five points of his own, including a three-point shot from the top of the key with 11:59 to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly made a late push with 5:23 to go off a made three-pointer by guard Taylor Sutlive. The Gauchos quickly responded however, as Green dished a no-look pass to Brewe for a layup to give UCSB a seven-point advantage. From then on, Santa Barbara went 5-6 from the free throw line to finish out the game.</p>\n<p>Gabe Vincent helped seal the deal for the Gauchos. With just 34 seconds left in regulation, the sophomore guard pulled up from the top of the key rising over Minnesota-transfer Josh Martin and drained a shot from beyond the arc. Vincent tied Green’s performance registering 14 points as well.</p>\n<p>Senior David Nwaba led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a team-high 15 points while going 9-13 at the free-throw line along with grabbing nine rebounds. Nwaba was Cal Poly’s primary offensive target the first time these two teams faced, scoring 16 points in the Mustangs’ 76-73 loss at home on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>In addition to their regular season sweep of their Blue-Green rival, the Gauchos clinched the fourth seed in the Big West Conference Tournament. UCSB will face UC Davis in the Quarterfinal round. Tip-off will take place at 12 p.m. on March 10 at the Honda Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether Hawaii will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West media preseason polls. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>The 2016-17 campaign has not been off to an ideal start for the UCSB men’s basketball team, which currently sits at 2-11 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a blowout loss at UC Davis last Wednesday 73-47. However, one could only hope that now that conference play is in full effect, the Gauchos can look to turn around their tough start to the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara has two big pieces that could help change the fortune of the season in guards Eric Childress and Gabe Vincent. Vincent, a junior, is currently second in the Big West in points per game with 15.8, while Childress, the team’s only senior, ranks third in the conference in assists 3.7.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they have lost two of their best big men down low in forwards Ami Lakoju and Jalen Canty. Canty, a junior transfer, was supposed to be a big force on the rebounding side of things, and he was ranking first on the team, grabbing seven boards per game, but he has been ruled out indefinitely due to academics. The same goes for Lakoju, who was leading the team in field goal percentage with a solid 61.2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m. in what could be a turnaround game for it as a squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>What stood as a promising yet empty-handed conclusion last season for Long Beach State, experiencing a narrow 107-102 loss to Washington in the first round of the NIT, has only added fuel to the fire and makes for a hungrier 49er squad.</p>\n<p>With nine returners possessing much experience, Head Coach Dan Monson looks to build on his team’s 20-15 record and heartbreaking 64-60 Big West Championship loss to UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>After a rigorous non-conference schedule, facing off against three of the top-10 AP ranked teams, the Beach stands at 6-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Similar to last year, the 49ers’ rough preseason schedule will likely be beneficial for them in their journey to the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>An even more jam-packed schedule this year compared to last could enable his team to get over the hump and make it to its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2012.</p>\n<p>The trio of junior forward Gabe Levin, junior guard Evan Payne, and junior guard Justin Bibbins have been the focal points for the 49ers’ offense.</p>\n<p>As two Preseason All-Conference selections this year, Bibbins and Levin have taken over the reins of former senior and scoring standout Nick Faust, combining for 22.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>Payne, a redshirt transfer from Loyola Marymount, has blossomed into his starting role starting 12 of the last 15 games for the Beach and averaging a team-high 14.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will face off against UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 4 p.m. The game will be aired live on ESPN3.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Will Bodendorfer</strong></p>\n<p>UC Irvine men’s basketball team and Head Coach Russell Turner, who is in his seventh year at the helm, are coming off an impressive 2016 season in which the team won a school record 28 games.</p>\n<p>The team returned just one starter from last season in senior guard Luke Nelson. Among the four starters to leave was 7’6” phenomenon center Mamadou N’Diaye whose tough defensive presence has been hard to replace.</p>\n<p>After opening the season ranked second in the Big West preseason poll, UC Irvine ended with a disappointing 5-9 non-conference record.</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start, the Anteaters have recently been able to right the ship, winning their last four games and boasting a perfect 2-0 conference record. UCI’s most recent victory came in a commanding 84-56 drudging of defending Big West Champions Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Jaron Martin has been the team’s standout player thus far, leading the team in both scoring (14.0 PPG) and assists (3.2 APG). After coming off the bench last year, Martin has solidified himself as a starter in Turner’s lineup during the 2017 campaign.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s next game will be a Big West conference matchup at UC Santa Barbara tonight, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to conference play, CSUN was at a subpar 4-9 by the end of its non-conference schedule. However, the Matadors now stand at 6-9 after their 2-0 start to Big West play as they are in a three-team tie for first place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Led by Head Coach Reggie Theus, the former NBA All-Star, and NCAA All-American is now in his fourth year at the head position. He and the Matadors will look to continue their winning ways as the regular season progresses.</p>\n<p>Northridge is powered by four Matadors who rank as some of the top individual offensive leaders in the conference.</p>\n<p>Ranking third in points per game in the Big West (15.5) is redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith. Complementing Smith is junior forward Tavrion Dawson. The Matadors’ big man ranks fourth in field goal percentage, boasting an impressive 56.8 percentage.</p>\n<p>Lastly, two Matadors top the three-point percentage rankings. At first place is junior guard Michael Warren with a 51.9 percentage. Meanwhile, redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson barely trails at a 50.0 percentage. Both sit comfortably as the only two Big West athletes that average a 50 or above percentage.</p>\n<p>It is evident that the experienced juniors are leading this team through their current streak. It will depend on their aptitude and willingness to get their younger teammates involved in order for the basketball program to continue thriving as it has been throughout the early stages of conference play.</p>\n<p>CSUN will be away from home once again this week, as it will look to extend its streak against Long Beach State this Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis men’s basketball team came away from its nonconference schedule with the most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ending nonconference play with at 8-7, the Aggies’ record includes an undefeated 5-0 record at home. UC Davis also ranks third in the conference in RPI – a stat that measures a team’s strength of schedule and how they perform against that schedule.</p>\n<p>The Aggies are an experienced bunch-backed by standout junior forward Chima Moneke and senior guard Brynton Lemar, who are both top 10 in points per game among Big West players, each averaging 14 per contest. Moneke ranks first in both double-doubles and rebounds per game among Big West players.</p>\n<p>The last time the Aggies had a winning record going into conference play, they won the Big West regular-season title in 2015. The preseason media poll had the Aggies finishing in fifth place in the conference, but based on their performance thus far, they look like they are ready to possibly prove the polls wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – DJ Ruvalcava</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team posted a 7 – 8 record in non-conference play and currently has a 1-1 record in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Tre’ Coggins is averaging a Big West-leading 18.6 points per game and is accounting for almost 25 percent of the team’s offense. The Titans are relying on him and his supporting cast to propel them through the rest of their tough Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>With four seniors, four juniors and a large freshman class consisting of seven first-year players, the Titans are relying heavily on their mixture of youth and experience this conference season.</p>\n<p>By having preseason all-conference guards Coggins and sophomore guard Khalil Ahmad, the Titans look to finish conference play with a much better record than their dismal 2015-16 season in which they went 3-13 in conference and underperformed expectations.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Dedrique Taylor and his team hope to improve on a recent surge, during which they won three out of their last four games before eventually falling to Cal State Northridge Saturday in a close finish of 70-65.</p>\n<p>Despite their 7 -8- record, the Titans are hopeful of their chances in conference play as they boast a 7-2 home record with eight of their last 14 games being played in Titan Gym.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton looks to build on their recent success against Cal Poly at Mott Athletics Center this Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>UC Riverside dropped eight of its final nine games to end the 2015-16 season, and the Highlanders appear to have been unable to overcome their slump in the 2016-17 campaign, where they now stand at 2-11 overall and 0-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCR began its season with two wins in four games by a combined 82 points, suggesting that a bright future was on the horizon for the belabored squad. Instead, the Highlanders have now lost nine of 10 and sit at the bottom of the Big West standings as one of four teams without a conference win.</p>\n<p>Forced to rely heavily on its young talent with just three seniors on its roster, Riverside’s trio of senior forward Secean Johnson, redshirt junior guard Chance Murray, and senior guard Gentrey Thomas has been the biggest positive.</p>\n<p>The three combine for 32.3 points per game, with each individual averaging double-digit points per contest, while also being the Highlanders’ three most prolific rebounders.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been woefully bad on the road this season, going winless in nine games. With four of the next six games at home, however, there is hope UC Riverside will be able to end its drought and mount a competitive comeback in the conference season.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Despite winning both the Big West regular season title and the Big West Conference Tournament crown just last year, the Hawaii men’s basketball team is expected to finish in eighth place in the Big West this season in the annual media preseason poll due to the loss of four perennial starters.</p>\n<p>Last year was a big year for the Rainbow Warriors, finishing the year 28-6 overall. However, part of the reason for the lack of excitement surrounding this years’ team is due to the fact that even their one returning starter, senior forward Mike Thomas, is redshirting this year after having to undergo wrist surgery this offseason.</p>\n<p>Because of Thomas’s absence, Hawaii is only returning a total production of just 66 points, 41 rebounds and 22 assists from last year’s team and has been a huge factor in the team being only 6-9 overall and 0-2 in the Big West to this point.</p>\n<p>While this year might turn out to be a wash, the Rainbow Warriors still have a bright future after adding five high school recruits and four CC transfers this offseason. In fact, junior transfer forward Gibson Johnson has already made an impact for Hawaii this season, averaging 10.8 points per game, a team-high and 4.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii will most likely not be able to defend both its regular season and conference tournament crown from a year ago, the pieces are in place to make a much more successful run in the 2017-18 season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s men’s basketball team began the season on the right foot, establishing itself as a well-organized unit heading into Big West play. However, the Mustangs have struggled through the toughest part of their schedule and sit at 5-10 overall and 0-1 in the Big West after a close loss in their first conference matchup at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Losses to key players at a crucial time in the season seem to be, unfortunately, following one after another due to injuries and transfers. True sophomore guard Jaylen Shead — who recently decided to leave Poly at the end of the fall quarter — the team’s assist leader with 5.2 per game, is going to be a hard loss to deal with as league play continues. Shead started all nine games he played before transferring, and the promising guard is yet to declare his next school after leading the Big West in helpers.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/JaylenShead/status/811288013225558019</p>\n<p>Junior forward Josh Martin, who was second for the ’Stangs with 10.4 points per game — behind redshirt senior guard Kyle Toth who leads the squad with 11.4 PPG — has experienced the biggest loss since his injury five games into the new season. Still, he has been at work on the boards with 8.4 RPG, nearly double the second-highest on the team.</p>\n<p>In the annual Big West media preseason poll, Cal Poly was projected to finish in last place in the conference standings at seasons end, and due to some unfortunate setbacks, the projection will most likely come to fruition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Riverside, who has dropped three of its last four games since facing UCSB on Feb. 18, dropped to 14-17 overall and 5-10 in the Big West. The Highlanders are in a three-way tie for fifth-place between UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara converted on three of its first four possessions, opening the game with a 6-0 run. Riverside Head Coach Dennis Cutts quickly called a timeout, benching his starting lineup for a fresh five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on the Highlander’s second-man rotation, jumping out to a 14-4 lead. Freshman forward Jarriesse Blackmon scored five of his career-high nine points in the first five minutes of the game, taking a pass from guard Gabe Vincent and connecting from three with 17:29 to go.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous [taking the starting job], but I also understand that I have to be ready when my name is called,” said Blackmon. “I was fortunate enough to have it called in the beginning of the game and bring that same type of energy I had starting the season.”</p>\n<p>Blackmon has started three-straight games for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following a 14-4 run dealt by the Gauchos, Riverside battled its way back. Freshman center Menno Dijkstra made his presence known in the paint. The 7’0” footer tallied in all 10 of his points in the first half going a perfect 5-5 from the floor.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gentrey Thomas also scored all 10 of his points in the first period including a nifty finger roll which put the score at 35-38 with 1:39 remaining prior to halftime.</p>\n<p>After an even first half, the Gauchos came out with a sense of urgency moving out to a 21-3 run. Michael Bryson took control scoring 11 of his game-high 19 points in the second half. Bryson was 4-4 from the floor in the second, including a go-ahead alley-oop from teammate T.J. Taylor which put the score at 65-45 with 8:39 to play.</p>\n<p>“It was a great pass,” said Bryson. “Watching [T.J.] throw it in the air, I thought it was going to be bad but I was able to go up and get it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had other weapons in support of Bryson’s performance. Seniors Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green all played their part in yesterday’s win scoring 26 of Santa Barbara’s bench points. Gabe Vincent had an effective night as well adding 11 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to match up with us right now because we’re so deep,” Bryson said. “Everybody that comes in is contributing something. It’s a tough road for anyone who meets us in March.”</p>\n<p>Green was the main catalyst off the bench scoring 14 points in 21 minutes as well as hitting a season-high four three pointers. Prior to Thursday’s match, Green came off a season-high 19-point performance in Santa Barbara’s win against Cal State Fullerton Feb. 27.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to focus on making shots when my opportunity comes, so during the game I can put them up, follow through, and make sure it goes in,” Green said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 29-55 for the game as well as shooting 50 percent, 12-24, from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara’s offense hit its stride, its defensive presence helped to set it apart in the second half. After allowing a 46.7 shooting percentage in the first period, UCSB held the Highlanders to a 21.4 field goal percentage in the second half. They shot 6-28 from the field, including 2-14 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“The difference [in the game] was we were really good defensively in the second half,” Williams said. “Our effort night in and night out has been better. Our activity level has to stay high on the defensive end in order to be where we want to be.”</p>\n<p>Michael Bryson, Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green will play their final home game this Saturday, March 5 as UCSB takes on rival Cal Poly. This stands as an opportunity for the seniors to leave their final imprints in a blue and gold uniform.</p>\n<p>“[This moment] will be bittersweet,” said Green. “Senior night will be a big day for us. I just want to make sure the six seniors including myself build a legacy here and create history for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently on a four-game winning streak against Cal Poly.
