Firestone and Akuamoah-Boateng pitched Ugig to a group of other students at the competition, where they met fourth-year political science major Cole Parker, who now acts as the marketing section of their team, and UCSB alumnus Justin Hemphill, who later joined the team to focus on software development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project earned third place and $5,000 to continue developing the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two co-founders were also invited to continue development of the application through the UCSB Office of Research at the Mosher Alumni House and plan to launch a beta version in the fall with both a web and mobile interface, Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are extremely grateful for the Office of Research at UCSB. They have been really gracious and willing to work with and believe in us. We could not think of a better university to start a company at,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair chose the name “Ugig” for several reasons; the ‘u’ represents both the university and the individual by providing a platform for people to profit from sharing personal data. The ‘gig’ part of the name refers to a job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Firestone’s experience as a researcher over the summer, the majority of his time was spent recruiting people for their research studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Opportunities are not widely available for the general public to know about or participate in. So that’s really the first problem that we are trying to address with our app,” Firestone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will Ugig benefit UCSB researchers, but it can grant students an opportunity to find, participate and profit from studies on a straightforward platform, according to Hemphill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parker said that the university system for getting participants is flawed in its effectiveness, but also tarnishes the quality of research produced. The main method for participation is through unpaid course credit completed by students who are often taking multiple classes in that field, which is not representative of the general population, Akuamoah-Boateng explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After interviewing professors and researchers at multiple universities, the Ugig team found it was a common issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a university setting, recruitment is really decentralized, and they are often recruiting primarily from their own department, but they are running studies meant to assess the general population. So our platform is meant to get anyone who wants to contribute to research in the local area,” Parker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig is unique in that it is the first company focused on recruiting sample sizes that better represent the general population, Firestone said. While many departments at UCSB already utilize software for managing research studies, namely Sona Systems, the team has heard from various professors that recruitment is still a challenge, especially outside of each department, according to Firestone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sona does also connect [researchers and participants]. The problem you see with Sona is that they’re not actually actively recruiting. For us, we think it is important to involve and market to the student body, the research that takes place at UCSB,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In reality, we are changing the model, and while disrupting the current technology, are working in such an underserved space,” Firestone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugig will be starting small with beta testing before releasing it to the public. The team has the goal of getting almost every study at UCSB on their interface by the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year, Hemphill said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe this app has greater implications for research as a whole. Our mission goes past the university scale,” Akuamoah-Boateng said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div

Not only is it the most exciting and highly anticipated weekend of the year for many football fans, but it’s also the most difficult to predict. Most teams haven’t had any real competitive action since the previous calendar year, and many have  since dramatically revamped their starting lineups. But with Week 1 now in the books, let’s take a look at some of the top storylines we’ve witnessed at this early point.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1801475155\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/pats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64682 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=222%2C222\" alt=\"Pats\" width=\"222\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pats.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Cheater or not, Brady’s still going to beat you</strong><br>\nThis lesson has been learned time and time again when it comes to the Patriots. It doesn’t matter who is surrounding Tom Brady, more times than not, he’s going to win. Whether he’s throwing to Deion Branch and Troy Brown, Randy Moss and Wes Welker, or Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, the result is usually the same. With the climax of Deflate-Gate finally having passed and Brady’s four-game suspension being nullified, the two-time NFL MVP happily accepted his fourth Super Bowl ring before walking all over the Pittsburgh Steelers to the tune of a 25-32, 288 yard, four TD passing night. Maybe the Patriots’ history of getting caught cheating made it easy to silence all the noise surrounding them? Whatever the case, Brady showed us last Thursday that another tally in the old age category hasn’t slowed him down at all.

The following year, he kicked off the greatest offensive campaign in NFL history by throwing an NFL record-tying seven TDs in a 49-27 demolition of the defending champion Ravens. Last year, more of the same against his old Colts, throwing no picks for the third straight opener to go along with three six-pointers and a 31-24 win.</p>\n<p>This past Sunday against Baltmore, well, Peyton didn’t look quite like Peyton. He missed open receivers down the field on more than one occasion and the only touchdown he threw was to Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith. I’m not saying that we’re going to be seeing a drop in production of Kobe Bryant proportions from Manning this season, but I am saying that this is definitely not the same guy who I did my “Make a Puppet of your Favorite Hero Project” on in sixth grade, let alone the guy who broke every single-season offensive record in the book just TWO seasons ago. If his defense can keep playing this way though, I’m still picking the orange-haired horses to win the AFC West. #vinoclub</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1609167954\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=136%2C129\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"136\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Dez Bryant out 4-6 weeks</strong><br>\nDez may or may not have “caught the ball” (yeah, he caught it) against the Green Bay Packers in last year’s NFC Championship game, but this past weekend he did indeed catch a broken foot to go along with his five receptions.

Give the man the ball, he’s hungry!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1342066757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64687\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/bills/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bills\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64687 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=67%2C67\" alt=\"Bills\" width=\"67\" height=\"67\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bills.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 67px) 100vw, 67px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Defense, Defense, Defense</strong><br>\nDespite new starting runningback LeSean “Shady” McCoy carrying 17 times for only 41 yards, Head Coach Rex Ryan’s debut goes well as the Buffalo Bills open up a 21-0 lead over Andrew Luck and the Colts on their way to an impressive season-opening win.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"488584061\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64666\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64677\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/chargers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=369%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"369,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chargers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?fit=369%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright wp-image-64677\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?resize=170%2C92\" alt=\"Chargers\" width=\"170\" height=\"92\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?w=369&amp;ssl=1 369w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chargers.png?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Bolts overcome huge deficit at home</strong><br>\nAfter going down 21-3 to the Detroit Lions, Philip Rivers and co. put up 30 straight points on their way to a 33-28 win.

Manning is now 14-1 in his career against KC, and joined Hall of Famer Brett Favre as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for more than 70,000 career passing yards. It was an exceptional night from Peyton as he completed 26 of 45 pass attempts, threw for 256 yards, 3 touchdowns, and one pick. However, while Peyton had a milestone night, the Broncos’ defense carried Denver to its victory as they forced three fumbles and had one interception. As if running backs couldn’t receive any more scrutiny after what took place in Seattle and the Meadowlands in Week 1, the shenanigans continued with the Chiefs’ Jamaal Charles. Despite gaining 21 rushing attempts, 125 yards, and one TD, Charles fumbled twice. As we all expected OT, Charles’ hands thought otherwise as he coughed it up with 36 seconds left in regulation which led to the go-ahead scoop and score for the Broncos’ 31-24 win. Sorry Chiefs’ fans, but beating Peyton just might not be meant to be.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Mr. Brady definitely took note of that as he torched Buffalo throwing for 466 yards and three TD’s, the most passing yards allowed in a single-game in Bills history, to lead his team to its 40-32 victory. Apparently the Bills’ needed “King Kong” like Ryan mentioned because the Patriots’ clinic didn’t stop there as “Gronkmania” (yes I just made that up), could not be stopped. Gronkowski had seven receptions to go along with 113 yards and a touchdown. It was a great comeback effort by the Bills, but when your quarterback throws three interceptions against a team, who in my opinion has the best QB in the league, chances are you are going to lose. It’s quite simple: Turnovers = more time for Brady on the field = TD’s for Brady and the Pats.</p>\n<p><strong>Cowboys’ Win, but lose Romo</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"489146748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/cowboys/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=2000%2C1903&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1903\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cowboys\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?fit=888%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64678 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=158%2C150\" alt=\"Cowboys\" width=\"158\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=250%2C238&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?resize=1024%2C974&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cowboys.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Entering this season, many had Head Coach Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles as the favorites to win the NFC East. But with the Eagles’ sitting at 0-2 after a 20-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, it leaves the door wide open for a 2-0 Dallas team that is eagerly hoping to make a deeper playoff run after nearly making the NFC Championship game last year. It was a fundamental win for the Cowboys as they dominated the time of possession battle, having the ball for 40:30 in comparison to the Eagles’ insufficient time of 19:30. As if things couldn’t get any worse for the Cowboys’ after losing Dez Bryant to a broken foot, the injury troubles continue as quarterback Tony Romo suffered a fractured left collarbone in the third quarter of Sunday’s game. It’s fortunate that Romo doesn’t need surgery to heal the break, but the Cowboys’ Super Bowl chances are definitely slimmer with his absence as he is expected to miss the next eight weeks. Don’t count them out though as Brandon Weeden went seven for seven for 73 yards and a TD, then again, the Cowboys’ did already have a 13-3 lead so we’ll just have to wait and see what he can do in a game’s entirety.</p>\n<p><strong>Winston wins in the Bayou</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1849514025\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64761\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/bucs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bucs\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64765 alignright\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=170%2C170\" alt=\"bucs\" width=\"170\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bucs.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Despite a horrendous debut versus the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, No. 1 draft pick Jameis Winston redeemed himself on the road against the New Orleans Saints, helping lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their 26-19 win, and earning his first career victory.

Throwing for 172 yards and two touchdowns off of an 8 for 15 passing night, Manziel played well after a subpar game in Week 1. It seems like he may have found his favorite receiving target in Travis Benjamin, who had three receptions for 115 yards and two TD’s.

As usual, Aaron Rodgers came ready to play as he connected on 25 of his 33 pass attempts for 249 yards and two TD’s to guide the Pack to its 27-17 win. Reaping the benefits of Rodgers performance was the multi-talented Randall Cobb, who snagged eight receptions for 116 yards. The “bad blood” between these two teams became a bit more vicious as Rodgers would go on and mock Russell Wilson in his postgame interview.

With the offseason acquisitions of Frank Gore, Andre Johnson, and more, it’s surprising to see the team that many predicted to play in Santa Clara next February off to another slow start. Unfortunately for Indianapolis, Andrew Luck has yet to play like the “elite” QB he’s labeled to be. He was responsible for four of the team’s five turnovers as he threw three interceptions and lost one fumble. But, recognition must be given to the New York Jets’ defense as it shutout the Colts’ in the first half, and currently lead the NFL in takeaways with 10.  The Jets’ receiving duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker flamed the Colts’ secondary for a combined total of 15 receptions, 198 yards, and two touchdowns. Of course the blame can’t only be n Luck, especially after a costly fumble by Gore at the two-yard line and Indianapolis’ inconsistent play on defense, but as the leader of this franchise Luck must improve his performance on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64761\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64761\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/","id":3290,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3289,3288,3287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Quick Tour of UCSB Sports","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Our sports editors provide a brief outlook on the upcoming year for UCSB sports","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Men’s Basketball</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64547\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1729478728\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64547\" data-attachment-id=\"64547\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/sports-arenas-for-print_by-lorenzo-basilio-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1440590244\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daily Nexus/ Lorenzo Basilio-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64547\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=323%2C216\" alt=\"Known for its energetic fans, and home to UCSB basketball and women's volleyball, is the Thunderdome.

They’ll also be recharged with a recruiting class that was ranked No. 15 in the nation.</p>\n<p><strong>SW –</strong> The past few seasons have been an ascending slope for UCSB men’s tennis. Dominating the Big West Conference, the Gauchos have been crowned Big West champions in two of the last three years. The team’s progression is not coming to a halt any time soon. It ended this offseason with the No. 15 recruiting class in the nation as it welcomed four new recruits and concluded this past season with a No. 52 national ranking at a 15-10 overall record, 3-2 Big West co-record, and NCAA Tournament visit. Much credit must be given to long-time Head Coach Marty Davis who has helped guide UCSB’s tennis program to win a total of nine conference titles. The Gauchos are set to open the 2015 season with ITA Men’s All-American Championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 3rd through the 4th, the team’s opponents are to be announced.</p>\n<p>First Game: 10/3 ITA All-American</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64543\" style=\"width: 309px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2073736532\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64543\" data-attachment-id=\"64543\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/sports-arenas-for-print_by-lorenzo-basilio-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1440588449\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daily Nexus/Lorenzo Basilio-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64543\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=299%2C200\" alt=\"UCSB men's tennis became the first team in school history to achieve an undefeated home record at 9-0 in 2014.

In spite of a 14-16 overall record and 3-4 conference record, the No. 13 Gauchos managed to claim fifth-place in the Big West Tournament with its win against No. 15 Long Beach State. Finishing during late-game situations is the key improvement to look out for when watching this team this year as it has struggled in the past. Expect players such as Samantha Murphy, Bryn Hudson, Camila Schafer, who all received All-Big West honors, and Orange County’s Female Player of the Year freshman Sarah Kreiser to carry the load for UCSB.</p>\n<p>First Game: 10/2 Triton Invitational</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Men’s Volleyball</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64545\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"657321405\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64545\" data-attachment-id=\"64545\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/sports-arenas-for-print_by-lorenzo-basilio-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1440589371\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Daily Nexus/Lorenzo Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64545\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sports-Arenas-for-Print_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?resize=278%2C186\" alt=\"Men's volleyball benefited from its home-field advantage in games with an 11-4 record in Robertson Gym last season.

A memorable 3-1 upset road win over a No. 3 Pepperdine side that had been undefeated at home was the highlight of the season for the Gauchos, but they failed to repeat their success by losing to Pepperdine 3-0 in the playoffs. Two-time All-American setter Jonah Seif will look to go out with a bang as he leads UCSB in his final year.</p>\n<p><strong>SW –</strong> Arguably one of the most slept-on sports programs at UCSB, men’s volleyball has quietly made a reputation for itself as a top team in the nation. Despite losing to No. 7 Pepperdine in the MPSF Tournament Quarterfinals, the Gauchos finished last season with a No. 13 national ranking along with a 17-10 overall record and 13-9 conference record. Led by Head Coach Rick McLaughlin, the Gauchos set Robertson Gym ablaze with its fiery offensive attack. In 14 of the team’s 27 games played, UCSB won in straight sets, sweeping its opponents each time. Although the Gauchos lost seniors Weston Nielson, Kevin Donohue and Jake Staahl, UCSB has enough talent in hopes of making it to a NCAA National Championship like it did in 2011.</p>\n<p>First Game: January 2016</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Women’s Volleyball</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach: Nicole Lantagne Welch<br>\nRecord: 13-14 Overall, 8-8 Conf</p>\n<p>One season after finishing in first place in the Big West, a young Gaucho team found itself in the middle of the standings in 2014. Another year of experience should be huge for UCSB as it looks to challenge for the Big West Title once again.</p>\n<p>First Game: 8/28 vs. Utah Valley St. – Pepperdine Asics Classic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Women’s Basketball</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach: Bonnie Henrickson<br>\nRecord: 2-27 overall, 2-14 Conference<br>\nHead Coach: Bonnie Henrickson<br>\nKey Players/Stats: Onome Jemerigbe, 4 apg (6th in conf) and 41.1 FG% (second on team)<br>\nTeam Stats: 7.1 steals (4th in conference)</p>\n<p>Last season was rough for UCSB, but a brand new coaching staff led by Bonnie Henrickson is prime and ready to turn things around this season. Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe will be the heart of the team as she looks to keep control of the offense, while fiery senior Jasmine Ware has a chance to be the team’s top offensive threat. Defense and rebounding will be the key for the Gauchos to make some noise in the Big West this time around.</p>\n<p>First Game: 11/8 vs. Cal St. Dominguez Hills</p>\n<p><strong>Cross Country<br>\n</strong><br>\nHead Coach: Pete Dolan<br>\nTeam Stats: Men’s- Big West cross country champions/ Women’s- 3rd place finish at Big West Championships</p>\n<p>For nearly 30 years, Head Coach Pete Dolan has been building UCSB’s men’s and women’s cross country into one of the Big West’s most elite programs. His work has not gone unnoticed as he was rewarded with the Big West Men’s Cross Country Coach of the Year award this past season. While Dolan is the mastermind behind the Gauchos’ gameplan heading into races, having a stud athlete like senior Bryan Guijarro is very rewarding. He is the first Gaucho to win the Big West Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Year since 2005, and is expected to have an outstanding season after helping lead UCSB to its school record low score of 21 in the conference championships. Representing UCSB’s women’s team is senior distance runner Victoria Tsolis. After earning a NCAA first round bid last season, her final year is another opportunity for her to continue to climb up the UCSB record books.</p>\n<p>First Meet: 9/5 vs. Cal Poly</p>\n<p><strong>Track &amp; Field</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach: Pete Dolan<br>\nTeam Stats: A total of three Gauchos participated in the NCAA Championships this past season</p>\n<p>Along with cross country, UCSB’s men’s and women’s track and field teams made progressive strides during the 2014 season. While the talents of former Gauchos Jessica Johnson, Albert Hughes and Thomas Gore-Schreck will be missed, UCSB made sure it had a productive offseason with a total of 22 signees. After a second place finish by the men’s and a fourth place ranking by the women’s in the Big West Championships, UCSB is on the brink of having a breakout year.</p>\n<p>First Meet: February 2016</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/a-quick-tour-of-ucsb-sports/","id":3291,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3290,3289,3288],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
