And in over a century of on-screen depictions, not one has been as utterly human as Ian McKellen’s “Mr. Holmes.”</p>\n<p>In the titular film, Holmes is 93 years old, and has spent 35 of those years in self-imposed solitude as recompense for the results of his final case, a case he struggles to recall. He vows to remember and write the true account of what really happened, free from the fictional embellishments from the mind of John Watson that have characterized Holmes for the rest of the world. But this is not the great detective we knew; senility is kicking in and he hobbles on a cane. It’s a little heartbreaking to see a man of such genius have to write people’s names on his sleeves. Sometimes, this frail old man doesn’t even seem like Sherlock Holmes; rather, he seems more like your average doddering grandfather trying to maintain his charisma in the face of mental deterioration.</p>\n<p>That angle itself unfolds wonderfully between Holmes and Roger Munro (played by the acting revelation Milo Parker, who bears an uncanny resemblance to “Game of Thrones” actor Thomas Sangster). Roger tries to immerse himself in Holmes’s world, making his own deductions and helping him with his beekeeping while Holmes tells him the details of his old life and tries to set the boy on the right track of life to prevent him from making the same mistakes he did. It’s a very interesting and <em>new </em>dynamic; we’ve, after all, have always had the Holmes-Watson relationship as the primary medium for showing the extent of Sherlock’s affection toward any human being in general. We’ve never had Holmes the grandfather before, a new concept that is played up quite convincingly. Make no mistake, however; Holmes has not turned into a teddy bear in his frailing years. He can still be cool and rely too much on his brain, rather than his heart.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Which brings us to the theme of this movie (ooh, a theme!) which is regret. Sherlock Holmes, is after all, known primarily for acting like a computer with legs. But deep down is a man who has finally realized in his old age that being so logical has hurt other people, himself most of all. For the first time, Sherlock Holmes comes to terms that there are consequences to his actions, good intentions or not. It’s one of the rare instances when the great detective actually undergoes some true <em>development. </em>Holmes is just a man and, like him, we’ve all forgotten.</p>\n<p>To sum these points up, this is without a doubt Ian McKellen’s film. Through his knockout performance, he has brought us an immensely humanizing portrayal of such a beloved character that we oh-so-rarely gain true insight into. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s magnum opus has been radically redefined while still keeping to his roots and that in itself is amazing.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, however, this film is not an adrenaline-inducing thrill-ride like something that Steven Moffat or Guy Ritchie would be content to provide us with; “Mr Holmes” is very calm, full of melancholy, but does have a touch of mystery and crime about it. Granted though, some characters have intentions that come off as unintentionally nonsensical, but that does not weigh the film down to a significant degree.</p>\n<p>To those who are wondering if this film is even worth their time … elementary, my dear friend. Elementary.</p>\n<p><em>The guy who directed the last two Twilight movies did this?

Though were the park administrators smart, we wouldn’t have a movie and Alan Grant would be calling up Ian Malcolm to tell him to shove his chaos theory mantra up his ass. So, I guess the main message here is to go along with the ride, no matter how eye-roll-inducing it can get.</p>\n<p>But don’t let my cynicism dishearten you; it’s definitely a very enjoyable ride. For starters, the characters of “Jurassic World” are a considerable improvement from the chumps from the last two films (but perhaps I’m just relieved that Téa Leoni isn’t back to shatter glass with her screams). Chris Pratt, hot off the success of “Lego” and “Guardians” plays Owen, Jurassic World’s voice of reason, raptor-whisperer and one of the two or three actually competent members of the park’s staff. Bryce Dallas Howard is the short-sighted park manager who eventually comes around and tries to remedy her mistakes (all while running from dinosaurs in high heels). Her nephews come to the park, serving as both plot catalysts and mediums for a shoehorned divorce subplot that only manages to contribute maybe another minute to the film’s runtime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But who cares about the characters, there are DINOSAURS! And lots of ‘em. One of the great joys about “Jurassic World” is seeing John Hammond’s vision come true; “Jurassic World” is everything that “Jurassic Park” was meant to be, and then some. There’s a petting zoo where children ride baby triceratopses, a SeaWorld-like stadium featuring the gigantic Mosasaurus, a much bigger paddock for the T-rex (the very same T-rex from the first film) and more. There’s also more dinosaur-on-dinosaur fighting in this movie than the last three films combined; the final confrontation had me grinning like an idiot, for it was so stupidly awesome.</p>\n<p>“Jurassic World” also gets philosophical to a degree, satirizing the nature of franchises and how people want new attractions/sequels to be bigger, better and more eye-catching. This is reflected in the Indominus Rex (or as Jeremy Jahns rightfully calls it, the Holyshitasaurus), a mesh of multiple creatures that was created to boost park attendance. When the Indominus gets involved in the aforementioned final fight, without giving too much away, it’s almost as if director Colin Trevorrow wanted to remind the audience that “World” will never be as good as “Park,” but “World” is still fun, regardless.</p>\n<p>But, as the internet has probably informed you by now, “Jurassic World” has a few glaring flaws. Let’s start with the villain. God, I hate this character. Not because of some well-written trait of his, that would imply he’s … well, well-written. Vincent D’Onofrio’s Vic Hoskins might as well have walked up to Chris Pratt, turned to the audience, and said, “Hi, I’ll be your mandatory douchebag for this feature,” his villainous demeanor is that obvious. He goes off on a plot to weaponize the velociraptors, which leads me to believe that Hoskins never watched an “Alien” movie, otherwise he’d know that trying to weaponize monsters with very large teeth usually gets you turned into a chew toy. Wait … oh my god, InGen becomes Weyland-Yutani!</p>\n<p>The film’s attempt to prey upon your nostalgia via John Williams’s classic theme falls flat on its face initially (using that music in tandem with shots of a hotel is not epic, Mr. Trevorrow), and rebounds later (I won’t spoil it, but … squeeee!). But speaking of nostalgia, there are enough callbacks and Easter eggs to satisfy fans of the original film, but not too many as to seem desparate.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, “Jurassic World” is an extremely entertaining flick that manages to stand on its own amongst other science-fiction films, but, as the movie itself makes abundantly clear, it pales in comparison to the original.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is anticipating the day when CinemaSins rips “Jurassic World” a new one.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-30/jurassic-world-life-will-always-find-a-way-to-bite-you-in-the-ass/","id":5912,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5911,5910,5909],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"7 Nicolas Cage Films That Everyone Needs to See","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-cage-e1447138512278.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-cage-e1447138512278.png?resize=800%2C630&ssl=1","description":"  Since the start of his career, Nicolas Cage has refused to be typecast.

He takes on countless roles that challenge him as an actor, and pushes his skills to the extreme. Over the years, many have considered this to be “over-acting.” What many don’t realize, however, is that Nicolas Cage may just happen to be the most talented actor in Hollywood. Below are some of the optimum films that showcase his versatility and pure gift as an actor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Vampire’s Kiss</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ah, one of his finest films. If the title didn’t give it away already, the answer is yes, in fact, Nic Cage does play a vampire. And yes, he has fangs. And yes, he is afraid of the sun. Quite possibly the best part of this film, however, is the fact that Nic Cage only <em>believes</em> that he is becoming a vampire after an encounter with a suspicious woman. It is all a delusion. Whilst coping with these delusions, Nic grows frustrated with his assistant, Alva. He gets so frustrated; in fact, that he feels compelled to angrily recite the alphabet. All the way from A to Z, Nicolas Cage shines in <em>Vampire’s Kiss.</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Face/Off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>John Travolta and Nic Cage switch faces. That’s right. Again, the title is not misleading in the slightest. Faces are removed, exchanged, and then all hell breaks loose. John Travolta plays an FBI agent who is attempting to prevent a terrorist attack, which is led by Nicolas Cage. When Travolta manages to knock Nic Cage out cold (trust me, it’s a long story), he realizes that the only natural conclusion to stop the attack is to switch faces. Obvious, right? The bloodless, seamless facial procedure feels all too similar to peeling the sticker off of a piece of fruit. Nic Cage eventually wakes up and realizes that he has a new face. And then, there’s the “all hell breaks loose” part. By taking on two roles in this film, Nicolas Cage truly justifies that he really can play any part.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> The Wicker Man</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’ve all heard it before: “NOT THE BEES!” This film is unique in comparison to Nicolas’s other works, because its eccentricity quickly made it a cult classic. Cage plays a sheriff in the film, who is sent to an island to investigate the case of a missing girl. What he finds, however, is a female-based Pagan cult. <em>Wicker Man</em> brings a lot of interesting elements to the table. For example, Nicolas Cage punches a woman in the face, inquires about a burnt wicker doll (“How’d it get burned?? HOW’D IT GET BURNED?”), and is tortured by pagans…with bees.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Stolen</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ever heard of the film <em>Taken</em>? Liam Neeson tries to find his daughter for a couple hours, only for her to be kidnapped two more times. Well, that’s what this is — but with Nicolas Cage. His daughter has been kidnapped, there are large sums of money involved, and there’s an abundantly emphasized deadline. Intermixed with the mysterious “We have your daughter” phone calls are a lot of frantic, hysterical Nicolas Cage moments. But of course, how could I forget the fight scene between Nic Cage and the kidnapper in which both parties end up catching fire? The scene is set to the 1969 Rolling Stones classic, “Gimme Shelter.”</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> National Treasure</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There aren’t a lot of people I would rather have lead me on a treasure hunt than Nicolas Cage. He has the perfect “Guys, I think I found something!” face. Who wouldn’t want to explore with that? The mere fact that his character’s name in the film is Benjamin Franklin Gates is terrific. In <em>National Treasure</em>, Nic Cage is curious, inquisitive, and kind enough to bring us along on his quest.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Moonstruck</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nic Cage as a central love interest is already intriguing, but as Cher’s central love interest? Perfect. In this film, he plays the alluring brother of Cher’s soon-to-be husband. And he nails an Italian (or possibly a Brooklyn) accent. Nic Cage is definitely desirable as a brooding baker in <em>Moonstruck</em>.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Valley Girl</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the movie that founded Nicolas Cage’s long, eclectic career. For that reason, a “thank you” is definitely necessary. It is responsible for his growth as an actor and his ability to perpetually improve his skill. This is also the film where Nic Cage showcased his ability to maintain a really convincing accent. He plays a rough guy from the city that meets a girl from the valley, but he finds that he can’t shake his rough ways. Amongst the superfluous amounts of valley-girl slang and bad boy allure is a young, blossoming Nicolas Cage.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/7-nicolas-cage-films-that-everyone-needs-to-see/","id":5913,"author":{"id":386,"name":"Natalie Noblett"},"related":[5912,5911,5910],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"He’s Back.

No. Was it fun?  A bit.  Does it prey on your nostalgia? Eyup. At the end of the day, it’s just another “Terminator” movie, for better or worse. Everything you expect to see in a “Terminator” movie is here: guns, explosions, one-liners, Arnie. So if you just want to watch a rehash of the older “Terminator” movies, you might just enjoy this film. Everyone else need not attend.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the plot this time? Pretty much just the second and third movies again: Stop Skynet before it goes online. Arnie gets sent back in time to protect his charge, throws and gets thrown by a technologically superior Terminator, the main male and main female bond and before you know it, credits. Except this is the first “Terminator” movie to include a shameless sequel plug, so it has<i> that </i>going for it. Not sure what else I expected from the guy who directed the only Marvel movie I can barely remember anything about. Thor was in it, right?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So what’s <i>actually </i>different this time? Well, Sarah Connor’s back (and played by Emilia Clark, the second “Game of Thrones” actress to stand in Linda Hamilton’s place), and this time, she knows the plot of the original movie, so that makes it a little awkward for her to be around Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney, who I might have actually liked a bit more than Michael Biehn). The two parents of future messiah John Connor (Jason Clarke) spend the first half of the movie dealing with the original Terminator plus a T-1000 (why are the T-1000s always cops?) alongside the T-800 (the Governator), before going to 2017 to stop Skynet from taking over the internet (again). From there, it’s another standard, we-have-24-hours-to-save-the-world, bullshit affair. Why couldn’t they just go to 2016? At least then they could get their bearings, maybe share some beers, watch the new “Star Wars” movie on Blu-ray.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Afterward, they have to deal with John<i>,</i> who’s been converted into a T-3000 – which pretty much functions exactly like a T-1000 – so I’m wondering how disappointing the T-2000 could possibly be. And, like most action movie villains, the T-3000 doesn’t seem to know how to run, over half his dialogue is villainous monologuing and he misses too many opportunities to kill the heroes. If Skynet wanted its enemies dead so badly, it should have programmed the only agent it bothered to send without a mouth.</p>\n<p>However, credit must certainly be given where it is due. Schwarzenegger is still a lot of fun as the Terminator, delivering lines that wouldn’t be nearly as funny without his emotionless delivery. In fact, I’m pretty sure that this may be the funniest “Terminator” film yet, and no, not unintentionally; I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of my theater (who were also laughing to the seriously unfunny trailer for “Pixels,” but still).  And the actions scenes will certainly whet anyone’s appetite for violence. Lotta bing bang boom, pew pew, you get my drift.</p>\n<p>But bottom line, “Terminator Genisys” is nothing new. It’s pretty much just a rehash of the older films, for better or worse. There is sufficient humorous and nostalgic enjoyment to be had and decent action, too, but none of the performances are compelling, and there are more plot holes than there were bullets fired. But hey, if you want to watch people shoot holes in a robot and watch as those holes are slowly filled in with CGI over and over again for the umpteenth time, whatever floats your boat.<br>\n<i></i></p>\n<p><i>Alex Wehrung was disappointed at this movie for not being bad enough to make writing this review fun.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64309\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64309\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-13/hes-back-what-a-surprise/","id":5914,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5913,5912,5911],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
