I was in a home I’d only dreamed of, but it was a dream so often-recurring I could have sworn I’d been there before. I could finally breathe the island air of São Miguel, Portugal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father was born in a village in São Miguel, and although he left when he was only five, much of his family still lives there today. Despite feeling immediately connected with this new world I’d just stepped into, I couldn’t help but feel out of place as I walked through the small airport and made my way to my cousins’ house where I would be staying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I struggled to understand my family and my surroundings, I began to realize I might not know Portugal as well as I thought. It’s an odd feeling, having such a connection to a place you’ve never been to. But despite never truly feeling like I knew this part of my identity, I always held it close. And now everything was foreign, yet so familiar. From the black and white bricks painting the streets like murals to the red-roofed homes scattered across mountains, I knew none of it, yet still felt some personal claim to the beauty. The earthy richness of the fava bean or the spicy tang of bacalhau — these flavors were mine yet I was a stranger. I desperately wanted to be a part of this country, but it felt like reaching for something I knew I’d never find. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I began getting to know members of my extended family, some I’d met when I was young, and some I’d never met at all. I quickly discovered how difficult it was for me to communicate and get to know them, because of one crucial difference: language. While some of my cousins spoke fluent English, most of them spoke little to none. I realized I had less than a month to soak up everything I could about my family and this island, so we were going to have to find other ways to communicate —and fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I learned how to say “fucker.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day, after spending most of it sitting awkwardly in the back seat, listening to my cousins speak while one of them intermittently provided me with translations, we found ourselves at a music festival, and that is where I learned my first curse word in Portuguese: “tu és uma caralha,” (which loosely translates to “you are a fucker”). Suddenly I was calling everyone a fucker; that trash can? A fucker. My cousin? A fucker. The stage? The tents? All fuckers. All of them. And just like that, the floodgates of communication were open. It might sound silly, and probably juvenile, but something about learning that phrase broke the ice; suddenly I could make my cousins laugh. We could have fun together. We could be honest and authentic and find ways to know each other beyond making menial small talk, because small talk was hardly even possible. I gained confidence to learn more words and phrases, but more importantly, I realized that a language barrier didn’t have to be the end-all be-all of getting to know my family or my country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than stifling myself, finding new ways of communicating became fun. In addition to shouting obscenities, one such way was through music. I taught some of my younger cousins to play the ukulele. You don’t need words to show someone where to place their fingers to make a G chord. We played songs both new and familiar to each of us, sometimes singing, sometimes humming. I also got to know my family through food. Together we explored flavors both new and familiar to me. I tried biffana from a food truck, and sangria from a waterfront restaurant. We played in the ocean and got pastries at midnight. We laughed and braided hair and bonded over Ariana Grande. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first got to the island, I immediately regretted skipping out on my Duolingo lessons. I thought that without a common language, we’d never find common ground. Looking back on my time in Portugal, I’m so grateful that I found a means to connect to my family that went beyond words. There is always a way to know someone, because so many things are universal, like food, music or the senseless joy of calling your cousin a fucker. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants to encourage her fellow monolingual Gauchos to seek out other forms of communication in the face of a language barrier.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Before picking up our chopsticks, my father and I would always place our palms together and say </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itadakimasu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to express thanks for the savory bowl of somen noodles on our table. After dinner, I’d mount my plastic stool, meet my 5’2” mother at eye level and roll tiny onigiri balls at her side for my school lunch the next day. At my after school program, Nihonmachi Little Friends, we would procrastinate on our homework by debating who had the fanciest three-layer pencil case or the rarest type of Iwako take-apart eraser. After homework time, the musically talented would go to taiko practice, and the athletes to karate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the sun began to set, our senseis would try to calm our undying energy by reading us a story such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momotarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Peach Boy”) or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urishima Tarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Fisher Lad”). After this failed, they would scatter square-shaped papers of various colors and prints over the short-legged craft tables and we students would gather around in stout plastic chairs to fold origami. Within minutes, sparkly purple fish would swim across the table, green polka-dotted butterflies would flutter through the air and orange jumping frogs would hop all over the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folding origami was my favorite activity, simply because it was fun. It was a way for me to make new decorations for my bedroom. It gave me the means to create tiny boxes perfect for holding the rocks, beads and other priceless treasures I collected from the playground floor.

Sadako was two years old and living near Hiroshima when the United States dropped its first atomic bomb on the city during World War II. Due to radiation exposure, she fell ill with leukemia in adolescence and began to grow terribly weak. Her distraught father uncovered a Japanese legend that promises anyone who folds </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(one thousand paper cranes) a wish granted by the gods. Sadako’s friends and family gathered as a community to fold the cranes in order to grant their loved one the wish of a return to health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspired by the girls in the story whose ages were near my own, I decided to take a break from the mischievous ninja stars and put my origami skills to the test by folding cranes. At first I had little luck. My first bird bore an enormous beak and resembled a pelican, mouth full of fish. My second bird came out lopsided as if it had fallen from its nest in infancy and broken its wing. I nevertheless kept folding, and, with time, perfected the crisp lines and sharp edges of a perfect origami crane. From then on, cranes remained my origami of choice</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout middle and high school, I used crane-folding as a way to pass time, to upcycle paper that would otherwise be discarded or to calm my mind when I became caught up in boy drama. I folded hundreds of cranes as did Sadako, but for me, it was always just a fun pastime. I never imagined myself in such a situation calling for a serious role of origami.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the summer of 2014, I received terrible news. My mother’s best friend, Beckie, who since my birth had been like a second mother to me, had been in a traumatic bicycle accident. On a sunny weekend ride, she had fallen to the ground and hit her head. The specialists placed her in a medically induced coma, leaving her entirely unconscious for weeks. This woman was my role model, a female, Japanese-American icon, who had devoted her life to helping other women of color less privileged than she was. I felt lost and helpless. As friends and family rallied to raise funds to pay her outrageous hospital bills, I wallowed with frustration in my helplessness. After all, I was only 16 years old with no money to give, no driver’s license to help with transportation, nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night as I lay awake worrying about the future of Beckie’s condition, I decided to fold some origami to stop my mind from circling. I anxiously ripped my old geometry syllabus into a square and began to fold. As I tucked the sides of the paper into its deep pleats, I began to question why I was folding paper at two in the morning. My mind wandered back to the sailing ninja stars and jumping frogs at Nihonmachi, until it stopped at the story of Sadako Sasaki, the girl who folded 1,000 cranes. Dazed and exhausted, inspired yet afraid, I asked myself, “Could cranes like these be used to heal Beckie?” I stared at the tiny paper mass in the palm of my clammy hand, then quickly tossed it aside. It was a senseless idea; even with the help of my mother and a few dedicated friends, there was no way we would be able to fold the 1,000 cranes needed to grant Beckie the wish of revival. I turned over in bed, forced my eyes shut and urged sleep to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning at breakfast, my mother notified me that Beckie’s brain had begun to swell. At risk of oxygen deprivation due to intracranial pressure, she would be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergoing a fluid drainage procedure to help alleviate this pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stunned by the news, I blurted out the 1,000 crane idea I had shot down the night prior, then crumpled with embarrassment at my impulsive absurdity. To my surprise, my mom praised my idea and encouraged me to move forward with it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87576\" style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87576\" data-attachment-id=\"87576\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/nexuspapercranes-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=650%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,338\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"nexuspapercranes copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=888%2C462&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87576\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?resize=579%2C301\" alt=\"\" width=\"579\" height=\"301\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That week, I collected the emails of around 100 of Beckie’s friends, family members, ex-classmates and colleagues. I typed out a message with a short description of the 1,000 cranes legend and a simple explanation of how to fold them. The email was set and ready to go, yet I still questioned my endeavor: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will these people even see the value in origami? They all have busy schedules. Why would they take time out of their day to learn how to fold paper? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought of failure and the humiliation of being the 16 year old girl who thought she could persuade individuals whom she had never met to join her in a paper folding project. Dwelling in apprehension, my mind flashed to the thought of Beckie’s upcoming procedure. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What strength it must take to undergo an operation like that.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If Beckie, my role model, could undergo a brain operation, I should be able to send an email. With the click of a paper airplane, I sent my hopes flying to inboxes all over the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the month, I found my mailbox stuffed daily with origami cranes on papers of assorted colors and patterns sent from Beckie’s loved ones in states I had never before visited; Minnesotans and New Yorkers</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alike were eager to contribute. Multiple packages from the East Coast came with letters expressing gratitude for the project. These individuals felt that cranes enabled them to connect to Beckie despite the fact that they lived thousands of miles away. They had been looking for a way to support, and this project gave them just that. Empowered by the community’s devotion, my mom and I quickly got to work stringing the little birds into strands of 40.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two months of unpacking overstuffed envelopes, sorting the origami by color and carefully running our needles through the birds’ delicate backs, we reached 25 strands. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was complete. Born from the hands of individuals living thousands of miles apart, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 paper cranes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> swayed together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a warm September Saturday afternoon, my mom and I hopped in our silver Prius to deliver the multicolored flock to Beckie. By this time, her recovery had progressed and she was back living at her home in the East Bay. When we pulled into her steep driveway, I felt my heart beating so loudly I wondered if my mom could hear it. I couldn’t decide if it was out of nervousness or excitement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probably a bit of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beckie greeted us at her front door. She looked different. Her hair was short as it had been shaved for her procedures. She looked tired. She walked slowly, taking each step with care. Although no longer hospitalized, she still had a long road to recovery. Yet, despite all the progress to be made, she bore the same kind-eyed smile that has never ceased to shine for as long as I’ve known her. When we revealed the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Beckie, she accepted it with reverence, calling it a “life-saving gift.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87572\" style=\"width: 518px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87572\" data-attachment-id=\"87572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/cranemail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=2048%2C1275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cranemail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=508%2C316\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, four and a half years later, Beckie has fully recovered from her brain trauma. She hikes on the weekends, cooks delicious </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chawanmushi </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(savory egg custard) and continues her work in social justice. One thousand cranes hang in her living room, a reminder of hope and healing, compassion and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these tiny paper birds give the gift of life, their sheer existence depends on generations passing down the knowledge of their creation. Hence, they serve as reminders of the Japanese cultural history, passed down through generations. They serve as agents of hope for the future yet to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, I felt young, useless and incapable of making a difference. I doubted my worth as a meager 16 year old with nothing but empty pockets and a passion for folding paper. But after seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s often assumed that donating money is the most effective way of supporting a cause. Political candidates solicit monetary contributions to fund their campaigns, nonprofits asks for donations to enable their efforts, crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe set clear-cut financial goals that can only be met with money. Those lacking financial means unfortunately fall outside the scope of individuals deemed capable of enacting change. Yet, these penniless souls may possess creative and alternative talents, which hold a transformative potential of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to imply that people should not give money to the causes they endorse. After all, Beckie’s recovery would not have been possible had she not been able to pay her hospital bills. However, this is to say that money is not everything. If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages others to rethink their change-making capability.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.

No, they’re not religious. Yes, my sister is also white. No, I don’t even speak a word of the language. My parents are not my saviors. I am not their token Asian brainiac. We are your average family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, I am a Chinese immigrant. But my mother and father were born and raised in the suburbs of Illinois. My parents have never faced language barriers, filled out immigration forms or sacrificed the comforts and culture of their native country. My dad made salmon and asparagus for dinner, and my mom and I went out to eat at our favorite burrito dive. I was raised in a family that religiously watched the Super Bowl every year and ate Belgian waffles at the farmer’s market on Sundays. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve never had a close Asian friend. I grew up in a white family in a predominantly white community and attended a private high school. I was one of the only “yellow” faces on campus. I don’t speak a lick of Chinese and was enrolled in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course I didn’t go about my life purposefully avoiding Asian people and consciously isolating myself. There was no reason I didn’t have friends who identified as Asian. There was just no reason to pluck people out of my community who were Asian and force them to be my friend, to racially profile and try to force myself into a community in which I have never felt welcome or sought out to be included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to my former Chinese roommate, I am a “banana”: “yellow” on the outside, white on the inside. An Asian shell covering a mushy white interior. I was offended at first. Yes, the color analogy to define racial appearances is harmful, but there was a grain of truth in my “banana”-ness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A “banana.” This term is white-washed. An exclusionary and divisive ideology that dictates who’s Asian and who’s just, well, faking it. A “banana” wears Rainbow flip-flops and doesn’t speak the language of their home country. But why is the authenticity of Asian-ness questioned and compared? Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have denied my “banana” status for as long as I can remember. I ticked off the “Asian/Pacific Islander” box on every form and questionnaire. I was president of my high school’s Asian Student Union club. I attempted to learn Mandarin on Duolingo (I never passed Level 1). I played classical piano and proudly identified as a person of color.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is my roommate who speaks Chinese, reads Korean and is on the board of the Korean American Student Association (KASA) more Asian than me?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my identity was thrown into question when I accompanied my friend to the UCSB Chinese New Year celebration in the Loma Pelona Center in February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red streamers draped from the ceiling and gold-lettered posters distracted from the usual recreational feel of the space. Circular tables were occupied by students and faculty I had never met or seen before. The fluorescent lights dimmed and my friend and I watched dance performances, songs and short clips of students in Chinese 5. The room vibrated with applause after each performance, friends cheering for their friends, performers giggling in embarrassment, supporting this display of what I finally realized was an authentic Chinese celebration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, the Chinese professor of the friend who brought me approached us with a warm smile, excited that my friend had included me. The professor looked at me and immediately began to speak in Chinese. My face fell flat. I was outed: the “banana” of the bunch. My mushy white interior was revealed from head to toe, from my scrunched, confused eyebrows to the Birkenstocks on my feet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food from Madame Lu, a restaurant downtown, was brought in and served buffet-style at the end of the room. My friend and I stood apart from the crowd, people-watching and eating when we saw my former roommate from last year, the “banana” accuser. I use the word “accuser” with the lightest and most satirical tone, as she is one of my favorite people on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having lived apart this year, it dawned on me that I missed our conversations about Chinese culture: me, humming the tune of songs that were in the performances and her, translating as best she could to find them on Spotify. Our conversations were mostly normal chit-chat, but I always walked away feeling like I gained a little piece of the lost culture I didn’t realize I had always yearned for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I left the LPC that night, chowing down on food whose names I couldn’t pronounce, I stopped being in denial and accepted my “banana”-ness. It wasn’t a derogatory term. It didn’t make me less of a person. I was an Asian-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These dual identities no longer existed in contradiction with one another; I was no longer in conflict with myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passing by Davidson Library, hearing the chatter of languages I can’t understand from the mouths of people who look like me but have life experiences and a security in their cultural identity that I will never know, I’ve begun to distance myself from the technicalities and physical appearance that superficially dictate my race.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the Asian communities and spaces on UCSB’s campus — KASA, the Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA), the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) and multicultural Asian sororities — the limit to which I belong to the Asian community is finally revealed to me. While we share a similar exterior, my “banana” identity sets me apart. Beyond the surface of every individual is a deeper and complex manifestation of quirks and strengths, flaws and contradictions.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These limits were important to accept. Difficult because of the years I spent in denial, but integral to my understanding of what Asian-American identity is. I used to measure my self-worth by how confident I felt identifying with each culture and was constantly concerned with simultaneously being authentically Asian </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> authentically American. I pulled apart these identities from the hyphen that bonds them but never felt that I had succeeded in wholly being either person. Assigning value to my Asian and American traits was a fool’s errand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling me a “banana” isn’t accurate enough. Being a “banana” divided my exterior and interior into a dichotomy I refuse to engage with anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of my uncertainty was shame. It dictated my self-worth in toxic ways that kept me believing I had to choose one.

When she asked, “How’s the food?” I politely nodded and told her it was tasty. But she laughed at my fear of offending her cooking and responded with a phrase that anybody raised by immigrant parents is familiar with: “How </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was surprised that it would have been more appropriate to say I didn’t love the food rather than pretending that I did.

There are few topics that are taboo to discuss. Perhaps this transparency has to do with the fact that the Netherlands is </span><a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/european-countries-by-population-density.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the most densely populated countries in Europe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – the tightly packed houses and the famed Dutch aversion to curtains cultivates a different concept of privacy. It’s not uncommon to hear people openly discussing personal health issues or their sex lives over a cup of coffee. When I was an awkward tween, I remember being mortified when my grandmother bluntly asked in front of my extended family if I had gotten my period yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have ever visited the Netherlands, you may have picked up on the fact that it is a nation of straight talk. If someone suggests getting lunch, a simple no suffices if you’re not in the mood. It’s not uncommon to hear someone outwardly telling a friend that they aren’t a fan of their new hairstyle. While this bluntness may come across as plain rude to many, the Dutch view the truth as honest and productive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I ran into some Dutch exchange students in the Isla Vista Food Co-op the other day, I asked them what they thought of UCSB. They raved mostly about the weather– which is no surprise considering the Netherlands averages </span><a href=\"https://www.xpat.nl/moving-to-netherlands/netherlands-facts/climate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 minutes of precipitation per day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But they also said, “You Americans need to stop pretending to be so happy and nice all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the States, if you don’t love your friend’s new haircut, you may tell them they look “unique.” Or you may agree to “get lunch sometime,” even when you know that lunch is definitely not going to happen. While I value politeness and I would still never outwardly tell a friend their new hair is hideous, I’ve come to learn that a little dose of directness can go a long way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year in Writing 2, I was peer editing a paper that was – for a lack of a better word – garbage. The previous editor left little smiley faces in her colorful Papermate felt-tip pens, and a comment along of the lines of, “Well, I really liked this part, but maybe possibly this part can sort-of-kind-of be tweaked a tiny little bit!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping Dutch directness in mind, I told the writer upfront that the paper wasn’t good but that I could help him out. Through this interaction, we ended up working together on our papers and became friends outside of class. Not only was the direct communication more efficient, but I made a friend out of it as well. Often times, cutting the convoluted crap makes it easier to connect with people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. When waiters ask how the food is, you’re expected to say it’s delicious. Or my personal least favorite – the “Hey, how are you?”  “I’m great, how are you?”</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m good!” interaction. I’ll be the first to admit I engage in these scripted interactions all the time – and I hate it.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of daily interactions leave it hard to connect with people on a deeper level because they feel scripted. When people ask how college is going, you’re expected to you to say you love it. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, I went on a road trip with some family visiting from the Netherlands. We were in an elevator in a Hilton hotel when a man noticed my aunt’s pouty face. When he asked how she was doing,  – instead of responding with the typical, “I’m good, you?” – my aunt told him she was upset because she was promised a room with two queens but ended up in a room with one king. The man charismatically responded, “You’re in Vegas! You shouldn’t be upset!” and brought her to the front desk to have her upgraded to a penthouse suite. My aunt thanked him for his kindness and when he left, she asked the staff who this random man was. Turns out, that random man was Mr. Hilton himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going beyond the expected line of conversation and not pretending to be “good” all the time can lead somewhere much more interesting. The Dutch culture of honest talk, while it does take some getting used to, allows for more authentic conversations and often results in some pretty good stories to tell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, differences in communication styles are deeply ingrained in culture, and that’s not something that is going to change. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to tell a dinner host I don’t like their cooking. But I do believe we can all benefit from being more direct. So next time someone asks how it’s going, try going beyond the fact that it’s going well. You might just be pleasantly surprised at what follows. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Britt de Visser encourages Gauchos to be more honest in future interactions.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8addad44bf92c0a0a6b5dbbe3c6ee5f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/britt-de-visser/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Britt de Visser</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Britt de Visser is an Opinion Staff writer.
