It did damage to the ecosystem, the environment and the economy,” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Carbajal is hopeful for his new bill, noting that the bill has a better chance of passing since it was submitted to a congress where a Republican majority is no longer in effect.</p>\n<p>“[In] the last congress, I was a minority, and the Republican lead leadership did not allow this to move forward. I’m very excited about the prospects this time around,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Of the 53 representatives in California, 42 have co-signed California Clean Coast Act, also known as HR 279, reflecting current sentiments to orient the state toward renewable energy  and away from oil and gas.</p>\n<p>“These are not abstract issues for the Central Coast and Santa Barbara. These are issues that we’ve experienced and to us, it’s tangible,” Carbajal said. “We need to wean ourselves and become less dependent on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>In addition to HR 279, Carbajal has also proposed legislation on the subject of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>“Last term I introduced — which I am going to reintroduce again — the Renewable Energy opportunities legislation, which provides tax incentives to the business community so they invest in renewable energy technology.”</p>\n<p>The California Clean Coast Act would only be applied to the coastline and waters of California.</p>\n<p>To address California lands, Jackson, a state senator representing Santa Barbara’s 19th district, introduced Senate Bill 169, a new piece of legislation dealing with pipeline safety requirements, according to a press release.</p>\n<p>The current regulations in place allow pipeline operations in California to exploit loopholes within the state’s legal system, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“If you are operating a pipeline to full capacity, you have to follow California’s law. If, however, you are only operating to partial capacity, you don’t have to follow California law,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>SB 169 would require that all pipelines in California, regardless of their operation capacity, follow the same regulations, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The bill would also ensure pipeline inspectors have the tools necessary to verify that all pipeline operations in the state are in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>Jackson is hopeful that SB 169 will pass.</p>\n<p>“I’m confident that the legislature recognizes the importance of protecting against these spills,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Jackson still holds some doubt about the fate of Carbajal’s legislation.</p>\n<p>She said that Carbajal’s “aspirational” bill would likely face legislative friction if it ever made an appearance on President Trump’s desk. However, she said the next couple of years could provide a less hostile environment for green legislation.</p>\n<p>“If we have a positive result in 2020, this is certainly the kind of thing that we should be pushing from,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>After previous attempts to remediate pipeline safety requirements through legislation, Jackson said she believes that there is only one definitive way to end disasters like this: “If you don’t drill, you can’t spill.”</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at maxabrams@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

A separate sergeant then recognized the car as one that had been used in an armed robbery in Santa Barbara City on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon searching the vehicle, police found a firearm, a brick of cocaine, Xanax pills and five pounds of marjuana with packaging, according to Hoover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also during this stop, two separate individuals approached the deputies to report that they had been robbed in I.V. It was then discovered that the suspects in the car were the same as those who had robbed the two victims in I.V. It was not indicated in the press release how that was discovered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the victims had been pistol whipped on his head and had a large laceration over his eye that was bleeding,” Hoover said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon. “The investigation revealed the suspects in that crime were the same suspects involved in the vehicle stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full charges for both include robbery, attempted robbery, conspiracy, possession of a loaded firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Harper was additionally charged with assault with a deadly weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail. Harper is currently being held on a $550,000 bail, but information about Francis’ bail was not immediately available. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The discussion touched on a variety of topics relating to cannabis, but primarily served as an additional step in the community involvement process leading to the opening of a dispensary in I.V. in about a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two speakers were UCSB alumni Lauren Vazquez, a lawyer specializing in cannabis law, and Devon Wardlow, director of public affairs for Santa Barbara cannabis retailer Coastal Dispensary. They spoke extensively about cannabis use in I.V., noting that the next step toward bringing a recreational dispensary in I.V. is through community outreach.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vasquez explained that because the licensing process in I.V. for recreational dispensaries is ranked, community impact counts as the second most important factor in the ranking process. The financial viability of the business is ranked first, but Santa Barbara County is using a merit-based system to determine which businesses get the recreational marijuana licenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will be holding a meeting in I.V. within the coming months to gauge input from the community — specifically what residents would like out of a local dispensary and how the dispensary would contribute to improving the community, according to Vazquez. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for the end of April, according to Gina Fischer, an aide to Santa Barbara county supervisor Joan Hartmann.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said that Coastal Dispensary, which already has locations in Lompoc, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, is going to compete for the spot in I.V. and is putting together a community benefits package for the dispensary’s pitch based off of the feedback she gets from talking to I.V. residents. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You guys have a ton of power in ensuring that somebody that comes to this community actually represents your community, and it’s actually going to do something helpful for you,” she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said she couldn’t discuss certain details of the potential community benefits package due to the ongoing licensing process, but added that she believes a dispensary could benefit the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way I would propose it is that a portion of the cannabis taxes and revenue that comes from this store is funneled back into Isla Vista versus going into the general fund at the county,” Wardlow said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Wardlow acknowledged that appropriating the dispensary’s funds away from the county and into the I.V. CSD would be difficult, and that all current plans Coastal Dispensary has regarding its community benefits package are subject to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said that he can not comment on any ideas from the competing dispensaries regarding their community benefits packages, he added that he believes that the upcoming cannabis store will aid I.V.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll be a huge benefit to the community to have an additional revenue source because that’s money that should go right back into things that will fund our community facilities and programming for students and residents, our roads, sidewalks and street lights and our local schools,” Brandt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ellie Hurtado, a fourth-year communication major and president of SSDP, said that she’d like the tax revenue from a dispensary to go toward helping I.V. families, as well as students who experience food and housing insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she would like to see more money for local youth programs such as the St. George Youth Center YMCA.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurtado noted that while recreational cannabis is both legal and accessible for Isla Vistans who are 21 years old and older, with many residents ordering from dispensaries in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, the primary impact of a local dispensary would be the tax revenue it generates. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has the opportunity through the county to be a really shining star in a larger ecosystem that is the central coast cannabis industry,” Wardlow said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/","id":4003,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4002,4001,4000],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
