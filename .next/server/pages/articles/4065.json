CSD voted unanimously to absorb the Isla Vista Compost Collective last week. </span><em>Courtesy of Jacob Bider</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the collective has plans to resume services in mid to late April; before it can reopen, it needs to fill open-staffing positions left behind by some Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC) staff who went home after UC Santa Barbara announced all </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spring quarter classes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would be taught remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) agreed to house the collective, the IVCC secured a $43,000 grant from the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) to run the program for slightly less than a year, accounting for breaks throughout the school year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said during the meeting that it is an accomplishment for both the I.V. CSD and the IVCC to be able to run the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really big win for the compost collective to obtain that source of revenue for almost a full year’s worth of operations, which is a really big deal,” Brandt said. “For us, we’ve stood up here all the time when people come to us with great ideas, which is great. But an idea just by itself without any action doesn’t always materialize into something that’s actually change-making.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC serves 96 homes in I.V., collecting composting buckets and delivering compost to gardens throughout I.V with the help of student workers called “dirtriders.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel extremely, extremely relieved and ecstatic that we have found a new home for the compost collective, and I’m very excited for the future,” said Jacob Bider, the current IVCC director and a fourth-year environmental studies major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Bider said he hopes to expand the program’s capabilities to serve more houses; currently, the IVCC has more than 100 houses on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did recently request funding [from the </span><a href=\"https://www.fundforsantabarbara.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fund for Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">] for a new cargo trailer that has increased capacity that would allow us to collect more compost, which would allow us to expand the program without having to add more workers,” Bider explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re also looking into the potential of using compostable bags instead of our buckets, which would save us a large amount of time because we wash every bucket after we switch them out for houses.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The alleged data thieves have since been arrested, according to the notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement did not specify whether it was Santa Barbara city or county police that notified the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates said it was notified by police on March 23 about the potentially affected applicants, including a list of their email addresses. According to Wolfe &amp; Associates, these individuals have been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Erin Valenzuela, a third-year communications and philosophy double major, only one person in her four-person Wolfe &amp; Associates-managed apartment had been notified about the data breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found out more from twitter than I did from them,” she wrote in a message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fourth-year student who leased with Wolfe &amp; Associates from 2016-18, and asked not to be named because they intend to pursue legal action, said in a message that “The main concern is the cosigners. If my data was breached, my parents are my cosigners so the likelihood of their socials being taken as well are very high.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals who applied for apartments managed by Wolfe &amp; Associates after February 2018 have not been impacted by the breach, and payment information was not compromised in the breach, according to Scott Wolfe, vice president of Wolfe &amp; Associates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe also said that people who have been “potentially impacted” by the breach have been notified and that Wolfe &amp; Associates has been “working to respond to a number of inquiries.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email sent out to impacted Wolfe &amp; Associates residents, the agency recommended that tenants “notify the police department of any unusual activity” and to “check with credit bureaus, financial institutions, and insurance companies that you do business with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolfe &amp; Associates also recommended in the email that tenants change their passwords for bank accounts, credit cards and “any other entity that you have financial dealings with.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the company encouraged those affected to sign up for credit monitoring services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have arranged to offer monitoring service with NortonLifeLock at no cost to you for a period of one year,” the company wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leasing agency also said to report any unusual activity to the SBPD case agent, Detective Rapp, as well as individuals’ financial institutions, such as credit card companies. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-89162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson and his wife are opening up the coffee shop in the same space where Coffee Collaborative used to be. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Coffee Company; Sam and Luke’s, named for their kids; or Moose, for their dog, were were a few of the names they pitched to their friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But ultimately, they settled on Campus Point Coffee, a nod to the beach by the UC Santa Barbara Chi-5 freshmen dorms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more we came up with names and bounced them off our friends, Campus Point just kind of stuck. We really felt like we wanted something that identified with the local town,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You could name it anything; I bet you there’s probably a randomizer on Google that will give you different names. But we wanted to come up with something that was kind of a flag post saying, ‘We’re a part of this community.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson, who grew up in Santa Barbara and graduated from UCSB in 2001, said he had always been interested in owning “something in Isla Vista.” When he saw the location was available, he said he knew he had to go for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This [space] was a big part of my life when I was at UCSB when I was here, and it’s such a great spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s vision for Campus Point Coffee is simple: He wants Isla Vistans to use the space as a place to come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson referenced Java Jones, which occupied the space before Coffee Collaborative, and how the shop fostered a feeling of community — one he wishes to replicate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Back in the late ‘90s, early 2000s … [there] were places in I.V. that were just like the space where your crew met. It was either Java Jones, or I.V BC, which was Isla Vista Brewing Company before it became a lecture hall. Or Deja Vu, or Woodstock’s, Freebirds, but there was a spot that was like wherever you met or hung out, that was the spot,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be that spot for people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson believes one of the biggest advantages the shop has in creating that atmosphere is the amount of space they have to accomodate customers. In addition to a large seating area indoors, they also have generous patio space, he noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other coffee shops in the area, Nelson wants Campus Point Coffee to have “killer WiFi” and late hours, but says the store will be “very responsive to the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson wants to be proactive about asking the community for feedback, particularly in the store’s first few months of being open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tentative opening day for the shop is Aug. 1, although Nelson said that’s more of a goal than a firm date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until then, Nelson will be working on finalizing hires, training the staff and finishing up the remodeling of the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson and his wife are opening up the coffee shop in the same space where Coffee Collaborative used to be.
