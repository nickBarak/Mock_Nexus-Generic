My dorm room looked out onto the lagoon and I was just a five-minute walk away from the ocean. It was so beautiful that I felt unnerved and alone. It was so white that I thought of campus as being the Wonderbread World.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came from the Jefferson Park/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles that at the time was still largely a community of African Americans who, like me, originated from Texas or New Orleans. It was a vibrant place to grow up. There were many skilled craftsmen in the neighborhood; my neighbor Charles owned a Jaguar repair shop and did very well with his business. My dad was the neighborhood mechanic and worked nights at the post office, so he was around in the daytime to take me and my neighborhood friends to the beach or Griffith Park. Mr. Bambino would barbecue peach brandy-soaked ribs and the neighborhood kids would line up for a couple to gnaw on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a kid, I would listen to my brothers’ friends sitting on the corner drinking beer, smoking weed and talking about the brutality and unfairness of the Vietnam War and the racism in H.P. Lovecraft back in 1973. It was a rich and complicated black world where I developed confidence in my intelligence and talent.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I needed all that confidence because UCSB was an overwhelming transition. In my neighborhood I knew no white people outside of my teachers, and most of them were white.  I lucked out with Mr. Martin, my African American second grade teacher who realized I wasn’t “retarded” like that nun at Holy Name of Jesus Christ, I Wept said to my mother. He expected the best out of his classroom of difficult black kids, and, later in high school, Mr. Klewitz (a former Marine) taught us photography. Then there was Mr. De Louise who taught the first creative writing course I took. And Mr. Feldman, who started an aviation club at my high school and took black and Asian kids flying in small planes with flying buddies. There was Mr. Soloff, who took us to Cal State LA to see his chemical experiments as he pursued his master’s degree in chemistry. The commonality between all these teachers is that they treated us like they gave a damn and included us in their lives. They weren’t indifferent to who we were </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they seemed to actually care about us.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, in my first chemistry lecture class, the professor said: “Look to your left and look to your right. By the end of the course both of those chairs will be empty.” I assumed he was talking to me, so I never went back to class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t acculturating because I lived close enough to Los Angeles that I went home often </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so often that I won the ironic award for being the most social guy on our dorm floor by being the least present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I stopped going to LA.  My high school girlfriend had been admitted to UCSB, and I discovered that she was now very popular. She was skinny and tall and, though that wasn’t desirable where I grew up, at UCSB she was popular.  She kicked me to the curb, and I was lost for a bit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonely was bad enough, but then I failed a course for plagiarism — I copied copiously from the Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I hadn’t taken notes in my philosophy course because I was too busy listening to what the professor was saying in the lectures. I had to drop chemistry, and suddenly I was on academic probation. I saw myself being tossed out on my ass and losing my financial aid and everything I had worked on. I feared leaving UCSB and breaking my parents’ hearts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started pulling it together and looked for classes to help me maintain a full load, and I found a poetry workshop with Robin Bell at the College of Creative Studies (CCS). It was fun and exhilarating and, because CCS didn’t give letter grades, I could catch my breath about my biology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I decided to ask Martha, a Latina I met in our composition course, out for coffee. Martha danced in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ballet folklórico</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on campus, and she’d invite me to the practices. Among her friends, it didn’t seem to matter that I thought of myself as a black guy. I was a Mexican to them, though I didn’t speak Spanish and neither did Martha. I liked hanging out with her friends.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                            </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martha left UCSB.  She felt it wasn’t a good fit for her, like many of the students of color I had become friends with. UCSB became even more devoid of color as I recovered from a broken heart. Luckily, I had made friends with some of the guys on my dorm floor and soon I was living on Del Playa with Pat, a cowboy hippie, and some other guys. No one had explained to me that there was a yearly I.V. riot. I shot photos for the Daily Nexus of guys in swimming trunks and women in bikinis tossing bottles at the police from the relative safety of my fenced-in yard. No way was I going to wander I.V. and be arrested for being the black dude with a stolen camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to learn the ropes at the CCS. I took a narrative prose course from Marvin Mudrick, who had a great sense of humor and would occasionally rip folks apart in his class. He said my science fiction story, which I had published and won money for, made him want to throw up. I turned to writing about my black neighborhood in LA and he liked it, though he didn’t know I had written it: Mudrick taught his writing workshops by having writers toss their work on the table in front of him and he’d read the stories cold, out loud. It was a revelation. I wasn’t being judged </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the story was being judged. I felt free to write about my life because I was anonymous. After 40 years of teaching workshops, I still believe his method of running a workshop is the best.  Also, Provost Mudrick valued diversity, and CCS was diverse. My friends and fellow students at CCS were black, brown, white and Asian. I never felt excluded. I felt supported as a student of literature and as a writer. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I won awards for my writing as an undergraduate and after receiving my master of fine arts in literature at UC Irvine. I sold my first novel, “Understand This,” to William Morrow, went on to publish six novels and some spent time on the LA Times bestsellers list.  One of the novels takes place at UCSB and is about life on campus and in Santa Barbara for African and Latino students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my success as a writer to CCS and UCSB. From being a Disney screenwriting fellow to a Shanghai writers fellow, from starting LitFest Pasadena (the second-largest literary festival in California and the most diverse) to watching my daughter Giselle graduate from UCSB four years ago, just like her mother did, and then receiving a White House internship and internships with Senator Diane Feinstein and Congresswoman Judy Chu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve taught at USC, UCLA, LMU and UCI, but I think of UCSB as home. My observation and suggestion for UCSB is to embrace diversity by doing what USC has done with their highly lauded and internationally known Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI). The program fosters diversity by supporting public schools in the most economically challenged communities, particularly for incarcerated youth. CCS has hosted NAI students at UCSB a number of times. As a former high school teacher who taught in inner-city schools and wrote about them, I know that aligning with a major academic institution with resources can bring tremendous positive change, but the commitment has to be long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USC’s NAI program has been going on for 29 years, and Foshay, a NAI school, is now the number-one feeder high school for USC in the country. NAI students have a higher graduation rate than the general student body at USC. When I was a kid, I attended Foshay Junior High, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I constantly worried about my personal safety. Now, it’s famous for creating the kinds of students who flourish at the university level. UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the hiring process at the UCs needs to address the dearth of professors of color. It doesn’t take rocket science to create a pool of qualified applicants and then use random selection to escape the inherent racism of basing some portion of hiring on congeniality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, I owe my career, my happiness and my literary achievement to the CCS and UCSB, but I hope to see UCSB and all the UCs become a more vital force for cultural and economic inclusion. It can and should be done. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jervey Tervalon is an author and professor of writing &amp; literature in the College of Creative Studies.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/","id":5657,"author":{"id":822,"name":"Jervey Tervalon"},"related":[5656,5655,5654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":822,"name":"Jervey Tervalon","biography":"Not available","articles":[5657],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Puerto Rican Protests: A Lesson in Democracy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2019-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/protest.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/protest.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In light of recent protests in Puerto Rico, Nina Nazario discusses the importance of this victory to democracy as a whole.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After massive protests, Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricky </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had finally </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/rossello-puerto-rico-governor-resigns.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced his resignation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Thursday, July 24 at midnight.

Since the storm, the island has been struggling to return electricity to people’s homes, provide clean water and rebuild damaged infrastructure. As many mainlanders have heard, basic needs are still not being met. Last time I spoke to my abuelo, he said islanders living in remote areas still don’t have access to clean drinking water since the storm. After the hurricane, my family on the mainland had to wait six months to hear from our relatives on the island. When we finally heard back from my abuelo, he told us that the family farm (which my Puerto Rican family relies on for food and income) was destroyed and that all the animals were gone. He showed little worry despite the destruction, even calling himself a “lucky one” for surviving the storm with his brother, sister, nephew and three-year-old granddaughter by his side. Unfortunately, many others on the island have not been so lucky.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perception of Puerto Rico’s crisis has only been worsened by Trump’s tweets and numerical claims in regards to the hurricane and debt.

In reality, $92 billion dollars is the estimated cost for what the island would need to be fully restored. Even so, </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress cut that number in half,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> declaring in courts that the Puerto Rican government will receive $42.5 billion in aid.

This decision was made by Julia Keleher, the Secretary of Education appointed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In total, 254 schools have been closed indefinitely, which has displaced 60,000 K-12 students. Moreover, many of the school closures have affected remote areas where local communities rely heavily on public schools to unify children, parents and teachers to foster a constructive upbringing for disadvantaged children. Keleher stood by her decision, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claiming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “We saw in the redesign as a unique opportunity to improve the system in an inclusive, respectful and sensitive way.” </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-20170505-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Facebook comment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response sums up the community’s feelings about school shutdowns: “No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.” What’s worse is that the school closures have disproportionately affected children living in low-income communities who were hit hardest by the hurricane. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At any rate, there are many complex issues to be dealt with on the island. At times, it’s difficult to imagine transformative change, especially considering the government’s overwhelming debt. However, after the resignation of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> optimism is at an all-time high. The win of the people sparked massive celebration. I even saw my own father become emotional with relief when he heard the news. He expressed his feelings to me over FaceTime, tearing up: “I’m so happy we got to see this in our shared lifetime. Through everything Puerto Ricans have been through, peaceful protest is able to bring change. It can happen!” I realized my dad was right. These protests were not about reacting to a scandal; they were truly a lesson. They were proof that civic action can foster real change. In any case, they serve as a much needed reminder to Americans that in a democratic state you do not have to settle for leadership you don’t approve of, and you can fight against a system of corruption in a peaceful manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward, many Puerto Ricans are wondering what the future government will look like. And if you weren’t wondering yourself, you should, considering that all of the billions in relief aid being given to Puerto Rico’s government, come directly from the American taxpayers.

However, being fully immersed in Spanish classes, eating breakfast and dinners every day with my Costa Rican homestay family and having to use Spanish whenever I needed to order something or ask for directions improved my comprehension exponentially. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90100\" style=\"width: 421px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90100\" data-attachment-id=\"90100\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/language1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?fit=2204%2C1936&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2204,1936\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"language1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?fit=250%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?fit=888%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-90100\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?resize=411%2C361\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?w=2204&amp;ssl=1 2204w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?resize=250%2C220&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?resize=768%2C675&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?resize=1024%2C899&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/language1.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-90100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With learning a new language came learning new customs and connecting with people from a different culture. My favorite part of the process was being reminded of how kind the human spirit can be. As I struggled with buying bus tickets, asking for a meal for takeout  or simply making conversation, I was humbled by the patience, kindness and acceptance of all the Costa Ricans, commonly referred to as Ticos. It seemed that all of the locals were happy that we were trying to get to know their culture by speaking their language and would go the extra mile to help us understand something or learn a new phrase. These moments of connection with strangers and new friends in a different language were truly some of the most beautiful and humbling experiences of my life.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I have to acknowledge the double standard that exists when non-Europeans come to the United States. During my trip I didn’t encounter anyone who behaved rudely or was demeaning towards me — which is truly amazing considering the xenophobic comments I might have received if I were in their shoes traveling to the Unites States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a disgrace that the compassion with which I was treated is not typically reciprocated when foreigners travel to my country.

It doesn’t seem right that everybody except English speakers is obligated to learn another language for a better opportunity in life — and what about the people who don’t have the time or money to go to school to learn English?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the globalized world that we live in, it is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn other languages.

My interest in learning another language versus their obligation is the autocratic reality that we live in and must be acknowledged in order for there to be any change. One way to lessen the divide between those of us lucky enough to be born speaking English and those who may never have the opportunity to learn English is to introduce bilingual education in public schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a simple solution, one that is already occurring in </span><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/13/learning-a-foreign-language-a-must-in-europe-not-so-in-america/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much of the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  I’m not talking about the shitty language requirements implemented in U.S. public schools today. In fact, currently less than </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/filling-americas-language-education-potholes/392876/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of American adults are proficient in a foreign language they learned in school. The United States prides itself on its infrastructure, military, strong international relations and other accomplishments, yet we can’t effectively teach our students another language. In the globalized world that we live in, it is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn other languages. We must start the conversation about why the United States is one of the few nations that doesn’t require a bilingual education in schools. We must ask ourselves why we expect everybody else to learn English but fail to make an effort to learn anybody else’s language. With a rapidly growing global market and millions of immigrants moving and settling in the U.S., we must prioritize bilingual education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my flight to Costa Rica, I was consumed with anxiety about how I would communicate in a language I hardly knew. I was oblivious to how much else there was to learn beyond the dialect. The warmth with which I was embraced by the Ticos and Costa Rican culture helped me regain my faith in humanity. As I connected with the locals, I also became aware of the double standards involving my own privilege, giving me a newfound passion to bring about reform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if learning a language still doesn’t sound interesting, you don’t have the time or you tried unsuccessfully to learn it in school, there are other ways you can help create a world that promotes acceptance, tolerance and advocacy. My message is to be kind and helpful to everyone, especially to those who come from another country and are trying to assimilate to a new culture. You’ll never be able to fully understand what someone else is going through, but recognizing your own privilege and being able to choose what to do with that responsibility is the first step toward a more just world. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler believes learning another language is the best way to get to know another culture and to understand what a privilege it is to be a native English speaker. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/","id":5655,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5654,5653,5652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Freedom Under Fire: Stand with the People of Hong Kong","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2019-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Studying abroad in Hong Kong has given Emma Xing a firsthand look at the clash between its people and government.

Currently, the riot police are laying siege on the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, trapping hundreds of students inside the campus.

To not react at all is to allow these injustices to prevail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hong Kong that I have come to love is one where office workers march peacefully during their lunch break, teachers are concerned for their students’ futures and students are currently fighting for their rights.

We cannot let this go unnoticed. We are privileged to live in a country that allows us to voice our opinions in public and gives us access to unbiased news sources. I urge you all to use that right to read the news, pay attention and stand with the people of Hong Kong as they continue to fight for the rights and freedoms that we take for granted every day.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emma Xing thinks that if we value our rights so much, we should stand with others when they fight for theirs.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/","id":5656,"author":{"id":830,"name":"Emma Xing"},"related":[5655,5654,5653],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
