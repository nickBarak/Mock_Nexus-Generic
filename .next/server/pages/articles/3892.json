When contacted by the officers, the suspect appeared to be confused and disoriented.</p>\n<p>Officers then noticed the suspect had an unsteady gait as they walked him to the curb. The suspect told the officers he was going to walk approximately five miles home to his residence.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the IVFP station. While at the station, the suspect became very depressed and began to cry.</p>\n<p>The suspect was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>No Shirt, No Shoe, No Chance</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 2:43 a.m. on Saturday, May 12, IVFP officers investigating a report of a fight in progress at a residence on the 6700 block of Trigo Road were directed to a 20-year-old suspect who had been involved in the fight.</p>\n<p>The suspect told the officers he was going to spend the night at the apartment where the fight had occurred. The resident of the apartment was concerned there may be another incident and asked the suspect to leave.</p>\n<p>The suspect went outside to attempt to find his lost shoe and shirt. The suspect admitted to having been involved in several fights and told the officers that his shoe was stolen from him. The suspect then explained his level of intoxication to the officers by saying, “I didn’t come here to read a book. Yeah, I’m wasted.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Rebel Without a Clue</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 12:22 a.m. on Friday, May 11, IVFP officers enforcing a noise violation on the 6500 block of Del Playa Road observed occupants at the party being uncooperative and throwing beer onto passersby from the balcony.</p>\n<p>Officers contacted a male subject who was holding a beer and asked him for his identification. A 24-year-old male suspect interrupted the officers, demanding they leave his residence and telling the other male subject not to provide identification.</p>\n<p>The suspect began to yell profanities at one of the officers and moved close enough to bump the officer. Another officer moved the suspect away from the officer. The suspect was holding a beer, so the officers checked his identification to verify he was of age and told the suspect to stay inside the residence.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the suspect exited the residence and continued to yell profanities at the officers. When the officer obtained the suspect and told him he was under arrest, the suspect immediately tensed and refused to cooperate. One small burst of mace was used, which terminated his resistance.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Jennifer B.

The deputies roused the man from his drunken stupor and assisted him to his feet.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the sidewalk sleeper if he knew where he was and he told them he was in front of Manzanita Village. A deputy directed his attention to the large academic building behind him and again asked the man to describe his surroundings, but the 19-year-old adamantly assured the deputies they were at Manzanita Village and that the offices in Ellison were in fact dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>The severely confused individual then told officers that he lived on Camino Pescadero, that it was just a short walk from Manzanita and that they should just let him walk home. Officers told him he was not close to Camino Pescadero and, despite assuring officers he was, asked if he could call his roommate to walk him home.</p>\n<p>The deputies said he could and he proceeded to reach for his phone. His phone, however, was not there and the still intoxicated man became confused and looked to the officer to ask if he had his cell phone.</p>\n<p>The deputy told him he did not have his cell phone, and instead arrested the young man for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Mon., Oct 27, 4:11 a.m. — At approximately 4:01 a.m., deputies received a report of an intoxicated man trying to gain entry into a house on the 6700 block of Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The concerned residents told dispatch that the man had begun by repeatedly slamming his body into their sliding glass door, and when that proved ineffective, had moved around to the front door and was banging incessantly trying to gain entry.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they witnessed the heavy set 28-year-old man square up to the front door, push himself forward and, with considerable force, slam the entirety of his excessive weight against the wooden door.</p>\n<p>Despite the man’s sincerest and drunkest efforts, however, the door did not budge.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the man and told him to stop throwing himself at the door, which he did. The officers then asked the man — who, incidentally, works for KjEE FM in Santa Barbara — why he was trying to get inside in the residence.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the heavily intoxicated male did not have an answer to this question. In fact, he could not say where he was, how he had come to be in Isla Vista to begin with, or whose house he was attempting to enter.</p>\n<p>All he could say for sure was that he had consumed between five and eight beers that night.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the deputies, though, who arrested the man for public intoxication and allowed him unobstructed entrance into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/","id":3889,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3888,3887,3886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB Shelter Seeks To Give Dogs Their Own Spring Break","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12794804_653833194755382_2444950633698469851_o.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12794804_653833194755382_2444950633698469851_o.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With finals looming around the corner, students are looking forward to spring break, a sentiment shared by the dogs at Santa Barbara County Animal Services (SBCAS).

The foster homes will submit an online application process, and successful applicants will receive all materials needed to properly host their vacationing friend, donated by Lemos Pet Supply.</p>\n<p>The program began in December 2015, with a pilot program called “Santa’s Slumber Party.” Its goal was to find foster homes that could host dogs for two to three days, giving dogs a family for the holidays and time away from the kennel.</p>\n<p>“We had so much fun in December with our ‘Santa’s Slumber Party,’ and so many people have been asking when we are going to do this again,” Jeanne Saadi, community outreach coordinator for SBCAS, said. “We felt that spring break would be the perfect time to give our dogs another vacation from the shelter.”</p>\n<p>According to Saadi, although SBCAS tries to do this type of program two to three times a year, they are always looking for permanent homes for the dogs.</p>\n<p>“[We] are always actively seeking longer term foster homes, especially for dogs that need extra medical treatment, have been at the shelter for a long time or have some training opportunities that could be better addressed in a home,” Saadi said. “But we thought [the program] would be a good way to get people excited about doing that and maybe even foster some adoptions out of it.”</p>\n<p>While in the care of a host family, the dogs are given the opportunity to take part in different activities, such as going on hikes, going to dog friendly restaurants or spending quality time with someone in a home environment. These types of activities give the shelter staff and volunteers valuable information and insight about how each dog acts in a home environment.</p>\n<p>“The dogs get a change of scenery and a lot of personal attention, but they come back with more details and this allows us to set up the dogs for a more successful adoption,” Saadi said.</p>\n<p>After the initial program in December, two dogs were adopted by their foster families, and a third dog was adopted by a family because of new information the previous foster family had provided.</p>\n<p>Saadi said the process of becoming a foster parent for a dog begins with applying, followed by the shelter staff matching the parent “with a dog that will best fit their house.”</p>\n<p>“If they have another dog, we want them to bring their dog to see which one of our dogs gets along with best because we do not want it to be stressful for anybody,” Saaid said. “If they have a smaller home, then we encourage them to take a smaller dog, so we just try to match them with whoever is going to get along best.”</p>\n<p>Those interested in hosting a dog should contact Jeanne Saadi at the Santa Barbara Shelter at 805-681-4332 to host a dog seeking a vacation home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
