The Leopards came into this game with a 2-1 record on the weekend; however, that momentum quickly sank.</p>\n<p>This one was all UCSB from start to finish. The Gauchos scored their most goals in a game this season with 16 while also conceding their fewest amount in a game, giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>30 seconds into the game, the Gauchos already scored with a goal from sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser. Shore added in two more goals after that before freshman attacker Natalie Selin wrapped up the first-quarter with a score, making it 4-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Sarah Snyder began the second-period scoring. 23 seconds later, sophomore attacker Guarina Garcia of La Verne scored its first and what would be its only goal of the contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB responded by going on an 11-0 scoring run for the remainder of the game. Snyder and freshman utility Abbey Grosse each scored to close out the first half. The lead for the Gauchos was 7-1 at the break.</p>\n<p>One minute into the third quarter, Shore scored again for her hat trick. Later in the quarter, after Kreiser scored her second of the game, Shore threw in her fourth as the Gauchos led 10-1 with more than a quarter left.</p>\n<p>Sophomore utility Kate Pipkin and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg rounded out the third quarter scoring for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The final quarter had goals from senior attacker Brenna Thomas, freshman utility Kate Coski, senior utility Jenna Solberg and Rosenberg. The final score was 16-1, marking the Gauchos’ largest margin of victory this season.“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>“Our counter attack was on, we were playing with great awareness and were just playing together,” said Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>In its second and final game at the Claremont Convergence, UCSB went up against the host Pomona-Pitzer. These two sides met at the UCSB Winter Invitational when the Gauchos won by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens entered this meeting having won four of their last five games after an eight-game losing streak to start the season.</p>\n<p>After a very quiet first quarter, the Gauchos led 1-0 with a goal from Kreiser. The second quarter was a completely different story, as UCSB went on a goal-scoring tear.</p>\n<p>Six Gaucho goals came in the second period of play while the Sagehens scored two over the eight minutes.</p>\n<p>Solberg and fellow senior, defender Sophie Trabucco each scored within the first two minutes of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer answered with two quick goals of its own as they brought it to a one-goal game.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Coski scored for UCSB, and shortly after Shore extended the lead to 5-2.</p>\n<p>In the final 1:39 of the first half, the Gauchos poured it on with two goals from Solberg and one goal from Snyder to close the half with a commanding 7-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Sagehens cut the lead to three with 2:17 left in the third quarter, but the Gauchos ended the quarter with goals from Pipkin and Shore to restore the five-goal advantage at 9-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB conceded two goals and scored none in the final stanza as they clinched another victory.</p>\n<p>On Sunday UCSB played Cal State Bakersfield in its first game at Campus Pool in over a month.</p>\n<p>It was a shaky start for Santa Barbara, going down 1-0 from a nice backhanded finish from CSU Bakersfield. UCSB answered when Shore found Pipkin for the tap-in goal.</p>\n<p>The roadrunners took the lead again after that, but UCSB responded with a goal from Selin off a counter attack to conclude the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter the Gauchos took their first lead of the game with a nifty far-post lob shot from Pipkin.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunners tied it up shortly after off a well-executed power play from an exclusion.</p>\n<p>After that, UCSB turned it on with three unanswered goals in just over a minute of action from Kreiser, Shore and Solberg.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the Gauchos increased the unanswered goal streak to six when Snyder, Thomas and Shore added to the lead to make it 9-3 at the 5:19 mark in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>CSU Bakersfield ended the game on a 5-2 run and UCSB won in its home pool by the score of 11-8.</p>\n<p>Improving the defense was a big initiative coming into this weekend. The Gauchos only allowed five goals per game in the three games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think we did a good job defensively,” Kay said. “It’s important now for us to start taking what we do defensively and fueling it into our offense and remembering to attack as the game goes on.”</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore contributed to another outstanding weekend with not only 10 total goals but also assists and steals.</p>\n<p>“I was super excited going into this weekend to get some solid games in,” Shore said. “As a senior I feel like it’s my duty to step up and take control.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos feel like they took another step forward with Big West play around the corner.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76214\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76214\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-sweep-through-latest-weekend-slate-of-games-behind-shores-hat-trick-performances/","id":4931,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4930,4929,4928],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini","biography":"Not available","articles":[1887,4900,4904,4905,4906,4907,4920,4921,4923,4924,4925,4926,4927,4928,4929,4930,4931,4932,4933,4934,5557],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"‘Chos Remain Winless in Big West Play After UCI Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Still winless in Big West play, the No. 11 UCSB women's water polo team lost yet another conference game after being defeated by UC Irvine.

Junior utility Mary Brooks saw multiple breakaways throughout the game which led to her hat trick.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter Brooks drew a penalty after being fouled by senior utility Taylor Shore. The ensuing penalty was scored for the first goal of the contest.</p>\n<p>UCI added another goal with 35 seconds remaining in the quarter to make it 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled offensively in the first quarter as they were forced to take many long shots as the shot clock was winding down.</p>\n<p>After the Anteaters scored two more goals in the second quarter, the Gauchos finally got on the board.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Abbey Grosse received the long ball after breaking away from the defense. She then drew a penalty which she rifled into the back of the net with a skip shot.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos conceded another goal before end of the half resulting in a 5-1 score at break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the third quarter with a goal from senior defender Sophie Trabucco.</p>\n<p>At this point the Gauchos were very much in the game only down by three goals, however, this is when the Anteaters turned it on.</p>\n<p>UCI scored four unanswered goals in the third quarter which extended the Anteaters lead to 9-2 with 1:30 left in the quarter. The deficit was too much to overcome, especially considering the tremendous pressure that UCI was implemented with their defense.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos cut into the lead with back to back goals from freshman utility Sarah Snyder and Grosse who had a team high two goals in this game.</p>\n<p>After Irvine scored their last goal, senior utility Jenna Solberg threw in a beautiful lob shot with just 4 ticks remaining in the game. The final score was 10-5 in favor of UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>With only a few games left before the Big West Tournament, UCSB are looking to turn it around and finish the season off strong by defending their Big West Tournament title.</p>\n<p>“Now that we have two regular season games left, I think it’s important that we come out with nothing to lose no matter who we play for the rest of the time,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have its senior night next Saturday, April 15 in its final home game of the season against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/chos-remain-winless-in-big-west-play-after-uci-loss/","id":4928,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4927,4926,4925],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Splits Slate of Games at Barbara Kalbus Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite opening the Kalbus Invitational with a loss to Michigan for the third time this season, the UCSB women's water polo team managed to win half of its matchups over the weekend.

With the quarter ending at the same score, this match was looking like another defensive battle as expected.</p>\n<p>UCSB couldn’t get anything going with the attack in this one. The Gauchos were unable to get a goal in the second quarter, while the Wolverines took a solid 3-1 lead heading into the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought it within one 30 seconds into the second half with a goal from sophomore utility Kate Pipkin. However, the goal-scoring woes continued throughout the rest of the second half as Santa Barbara was outscored 2-7.</p>\n<p>The final score was 10-4 in Michigan’s favor, marking their third victory over UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>In its following match the next morning, UCSB faced Cal State Northridge with both squads looking to bounce back after beginning the tournament with tough defeats.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a slow start, as the Matadors had a 2-0 lead with 4:27 remaining in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>At the 2:08 mark Santa Barbara was finally on the board after freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored her first goal of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Just 42 seconds into the first half, senior utility Taylor Shore evened the score at 2-2 in what turned out to be a remarkable quarter for the captain.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute went by when Snyder scored to give UCSB its first lead of the contest.</p>\n<p>Shore then stole the show as she netted her second goal of the game at the 4:13 mark and her third goal with 3:32 remaining. Shore’s second-quarter hat trick was the fifth time in 15 games this season that she has scored at least three goals in a game.</p>\n<p>The first half ended 5-4 with CSUN very much alive to take the victory.</p>\n<p>Eight goals were scored between both teams in the third quarter. First it was sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser, then Snyder extended the Gaucho lead to 7-4.</p>\n<p>CSUN answered with two goals of its own as it continued to hang around.</p>\n<p>With a 7-6 lead halfway through the third quarter, UCSB scored three consecutive goals, two from Pipkin and one from Shore. The third quarter ended 10-7 with the Gauchos on top.</p>\n<p>Kreiser scored the only goal for Gauchos in a quiet final stanza, giving them their first win of the tournament by the score of 11-8.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior and recent returnee Miranda Schrader contributed with a team-high four assists. Freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder was also very productive with nine saves.</p>\n<p>A victory meant UCSB was set to face San Jose State to try to continue its winning ways.</p>\n<p>In this tight contest, the first period ended 2-1, advantage Spartans. Senior defender Sophie Trabucco scored the lone goal for UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB put together a strong quarter in the second as it took the lead 3-2 with two goals from senior attacker Brenna Thomas.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth third quarter included two goals from each team. Snyder and Kreiser scored for Santa Barbara to keep the one-goal advantage at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Pipkin threw in her only goal of the game with 5:19 remaining to increase the lead to two goals.</p>\n<p>San JoseState came together for a late surge, scoring two goals in the final 2:12 of the game to send this one into overtime.</p>\n<p>The Spartans opened the scoring, but Kreiser answered 24 seconds later, sending it into a second overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB couldn’t find the net in the second overtime and conceded two goals, resulting in a heartbreaking loss. This is the first loss for the Gauchos against a team ranked behind them in the national rankings.</p>\n<p>Snyder tied her season-high with 15 saves in the cage. Thomas and Kreiser led the team in goals with two apiece.</p>\n<p>After dropping two of their first three games, UCSB was in the 11th-place game against UC San Diego, who also had a record of 1-2 in the tournament.</p>\n<p>At their previous tournament in San Diego, the Gauchos only allowed 6.5 goals per game. Through three games in Irvine, the Gauchos conceded nine goals per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara reverted to their old ways as they stepped it up on the defensive end versus UCSD. Both the defense and the offense had some great moments in this game.</p>\n<p>The first quarter was a Gaucho goal-scoring frenzy. Five goals were poured in by Kreiser, Trabucco, Selin and Pipkin, who had two.</p>\n<p>Seniors Thomas and Shore scored the two second-quarter goals, which brought the score to 7-2 at halftime with UCSB on top.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter Pipkin finished off her hat trick, with UCSB leading 8-5 heading into their final quarter of the tournament. Neither team found a goal in the fourth quarter, which meant UCSB earned 11th place in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational.</p>\n<p>The results were not as hoped, but this young team still had plenty of good moments to take away from the weekend.</p>\n<p>Next weekend UCSB will participate in the Claremont Convergence before beginning Big West conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/no-9-ucsb-splits-slate-of-games-at-barbara-kalbus-invitational/","id":4929,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4928,4927,4926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Participating in Claremont Convergence Invite, Sat.

Last year, the Leopards finished 18-6, their best record in program history, losing in the final of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>Their great run last year was a big improvement considering they had only won 13 games in the previous two years combined.</p>\n<p>Along with the players, a key to their success came from former Head Coach William Rodriguez. Last season, Rodriguez was named the SCIAC Women’s Water Polo Coach of the Year before stepping down to take a Director of Aquatics job elsewhere.</p>\n<p>One year removed from a fantastic season, the Leopards return almost everyone with only one freshman in the mix.</p>\n<p>La Verne’s roster is comprised of 13 juniors and seniors compared to only six for UCSB. These two teams met last year in the same event when UCSB won 21-6.</p>\n<p>The second opponent for Santa Barbara in the Claremont Convergence will be the host Pomona-Pitzer, who the Gauchos defeated 15-5 earlier in the year at their Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Pomona-Pitzer arrives with only one victory in 10 games. The Sagehens began the season with an eight-game losing streak by an average of almost nine goals per contest.</p>\n<p>Most of the team is back from last year, including a core of four players who were the Sagehens top-four goal scorers. One of those players is junior attacker Morgan McCracken, who was selected as the SCIAC Water Polo Player of the Week after tallying her first multi-goal game of the season last week.</p>\n<p>Looking to turn this season around, the current nucleus of players have experienced some success in recent years with at least 19 wins in four of the last five seasons.</p>\n<p>In their most recent games, Pomona-Pitzer won 17-3 and lost 13-11. They seem to be moving in the right direction heading into this weekend.</p>\n<p>After taking part in the Claremont Convergence, the Gauchos will travel back to UCSB for a home game versus No. 24 Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>The 8-7 roadrunners are 6-2 in their last eight games. Last weekend, they swept their four games at the Cal Lutheran Tina Finali Invitational, winning with nearly a 14-goal average margin of victory.</p>\n<p>However, CSU Bakersfield is 1-6 this year against top-25 ranked opponents, which could be a good sign for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>This will be the first home game for UCSB since their Winter Invitational over a month ago.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play two games in the Pomona-Pitzer Haldeman Pool this Saturday, March 4, when they face La Verne at 2:15 p.m. and the hosts, Pomona-Pitzer, at 7:15 p.m. On Sunday, UCSB will play at home versus Cal State Bakersfield at noon.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76059\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76059\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/chos-participating-in-claremont-convergence-invite-sat-doubleheader-scheduled/","id":4930,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4929,4928,4927],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
