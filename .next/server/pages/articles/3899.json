Segev completed the surgery in early March, transplanting a liver and kidney from a deceased HIV-positive donor to two HIV-positive recipients. Although the procedure posed the risk of transplanting a different HIV strain, the surgery was successful for both patients.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama signed the H.O.P.E. Act into law in November 2013, allowing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for transplantations and laboratory studies. The initial ban was enacted in the 1980s as a solution to a climate of fear surrounding HIV/A.I.D.S., research has since found HIV-positive donations to be safe for transplant.</p>\n<p>CJ Young, representative from Lois Capps’s office, said Capps is “extremely excited” about the successful surgeries and that research resulting from the H.O.P.E. Act has removed the stigmas surrounding HIV-positive donors.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the stigma around HIV is critically important; that stigma can be a barrier to gaining access to treatment,” Young said. LGBTQ communities were “drastically impacted” by the stigmatization of HIV donors, Young said, and former school nurse Capps used the legislation to help amend the problem.</p>\n<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Christine Durand of Johns Hopkins said both transplant patients, who wished to have their identities kept private, are doing “extremely well.” The kidney patient has returned home, and the liver patient is expected to be discharged in a few days.</p>\n<p>“The patient would have remained on the waitlist for years,” said Dr. Durand, describing donor conditions prior to the H.O.P.E. Act.</p>\n<p>The use of HIV-positive organ donors can potentially add 300 to 500 donors to the current waitlists, serving nearly 1,000 recipients, said Dr. Segev. The success of the surgery combined with the legislation in the H.O.P.E. Act promises future life-saving transplants for HIV-positive patients and those with end-stage organ diseases.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69216\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69216\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/cappss-h-o-p-e-act-yields-two-successful-surgeries/","id":3899,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3898,3897,3896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2001-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a 19-year-old male sitting on a fence holding a red keg cup.
