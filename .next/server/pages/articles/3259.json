Valdenegro:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June 2017, the city of Philadelphia raised its rainbow flag high for its first annual Pride Kickoff. The pride flag fluttered in the Philadelphia air, championing the experiences of millions of TLGBQ+*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> members across the world. It harkened to the activism that got us here and to the activism to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the difference that this flag had as it marched through the streets of Philadelphia and through the many streets after that are the two stripes that adorned it on top. One black and one brown—an innocuous reminder that queerness is woven into more colors than just one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being here at UCSB has proven to me that I am those stripes. Let me explain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college experience has pushed and pulled, expanded and contracted, championed and sequestered the many identities that constitute me. In some contexts, my brownness is celebrated. My native tongue expresses itself freely and without harassment. I can wear rainbow buttons happily and without danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in other contexts, as a lot of us have come to realize, we have to push aside who we are for an identity that is more immediate and palatable. We have to relegate our life experiences to just business or to whatever the sign on the door says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point, many of us have felt the sting from the relegation I’m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re struggling to make ends meet that week, you probably don’t want to tell your professor. Why make it about you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re doing science, you’re not a woman; you’re a scientist. Why does it have to be about gender?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re an academic, you’re not a person of color; you’re an academic. Why do you have to make it about race?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re a non-traditional student, you’re just a student. Why are you different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this kind of thinking is dangerous when we ignore the disparities and disadvantages that might exist in our settings. It is impossible to support one another if we do not understand the situations we exist in. I can’t save you from drowning if I refuse to acknowledge you’re underwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, being a person of color fighting behind the rainbow flag used to mean leaving our brownness at the door with the umbrellas. It meant fighting for a movement that never really promised to help those in the intersection of being a person of color and queer. (And don’t even get me started on how much more we need to advocate for trans people.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the wisdom that our queer brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings in Philadelphia reminded us of that June is the diverse nature of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That one descriptor does not fit all. We are not just gay. We are not just queer. Those words are just adjectives among a multiplicity of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this Pride, go celebrate the diverse nature of being queer — heck, even the diverse nature of just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being human</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And even if you’re not queer, I invite you to turn to the person next to you and appreciate them for the depth of who they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go fight for each other. Celebrate one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did that on purpose</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ángel A. Valdenegro is a graduating queer Latino physics major who wants you to google Kayden Clarke, Tamika Washington and Chynal Lindsey.</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>Being Invisibly Queer: by Kylie George</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who have been by my side throughout every one of my phases in college (*cough cough Nexites cough cough*), y’all know all about my various dick-scapades: From the Night of Three to fucking a random dude I met at a bus stop, my thirst for peen is never quenched.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly the craziest thing I’ve ever done to date, however, is willingly enter into a healthy, committed relationship for the last year and some change. Shocker: This person has a penis. Therefore, my relationship will appear heterosexual to the average stranger for (hopefully) the rest of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this staunch dedication to cock has caused some problems for me throughout my time at UCSB, if not from external sources then from my own internal thought processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I constantly questioned — and sometimes still question — my validity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community because before sophomore year of college, I had never acted on any of my feelings toward various women in my life to whom I felt attracted. I felt like the only way for me to prove to both myself and others that my bisexuality was a valid self-descriptor was by experiencing reciprocal sex with a woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t even completely out until my sophomore year of college and, even still, I haven’t directly told my mom yet (if you’re reading this, Mom, hey hello hi, I’m bi!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my entire first year of college, I thought that people in my dorm hall would be made uncomfortable with the fact that I’m attracted to girls, so I kept my identity on the down low. It didn’t help that I was ultra-paranoid about the way people perceived me and if they liked me or not because of my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I say this literally </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crippling anxiety. I was also affected by the perceived lack of a queer community on campus, so I thought being out would not be accepted by the majority of UCSB students or faculty, thus further encouraging me to beat down a large part of who I was and still am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not until I joined a sorority (Tri Delta, R.I.P.) did I feel comfortable openly sharing my deep attraction to that güd pu$$. Sure, it helped that over the summer I saw a psychiatrist and got put on a pretty high dose of Prozac to help with my anxiety, but I truly feel that I began publicly identifying as queer because of the amazing queer women I met in Tri Delta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m fully aware of how sratty this next sentence is going to sound, but hear me out: My Big really inspired me to embrace a large facet of my identity by sharing her own story and her various struggles that come with being gay. From bringing me down from a panic attack brought on by being pretty publicly sexually assaulted to opening my eyes to the awesome (and very present) LGBTQ+ community on campus, I owe this woman a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey to self-acceptance did not conclude at the beginning of sophomore year, though. I mean, what am I? Fucking Molly Ringwald in “The Breakfast Club”???? Good guess, but not quite. I still have to exist after the happily-ever-after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incidentally, though, I ended up sleeping with a woman for the first time shortly after this life-changing epiphany, and it left me with a bag filled with mixed feelings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took her home from a frat party (wearing a huge sweatshirt, pajama bottoms and fuzzy socks with my Birks, no less), and the deed was done. The only problem was that afterward, I didn’t feel like I proved anything to anybody by doing it. The encounter felt just as empty as the billionth dick I sucked dry the week prior, and I ended up feeling like I had an even feebler claim to membership in the queer community than I did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since that night, I have not slept with another woman, and at this point I may never get to. Don’t get me wrong; my current partner is more than I could ever ask for in a lifelong companion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’m still worried about how others perceive the image I put out into the world, which is dumb and I should stop that right now, but emotions don’t work that way. I want it to be apparent that I’m queer and not just lying about it to get attention, but I’m struggling with finding a way other than tattooing “QUEER” on my forehead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend was talking to me the other day about being bisexual in college, and she expressed a lot of frustration for the girls who identify as “bi-curious” because they give “real” bisexual women a bad image. I couldn’t help but think about the ease with which I could be grouped in with the former group, and I felt so invalidated. I’m not saying the friend was talking about me or even that I agree with their statement (which I very much don’t), but I realized in that moment that I still don’t feel deserving of the label “queer” or “bisexual.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m learning to embrace my identity and stand up when people comment on my “invisible queerness” brought on by my love for my heterosexual male partner, but I still have a long way to go to where I really feel like I can appropriately consider myself queer.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/lgbtqia-vignettes-class-of-2019/","id":3259,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3258,3257,3256],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[1843,3129,3259,3502,3503,3504,3507,3508,3509,3518,3526,3536,3579,3646,4290,7849],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Nexus Sports Editors Say Their Goodbyes: Paul-Michael Ochoa","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kristen and Paul-Michael Dish on UCSB, Isla Vista and Their Time as Sports Editors  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Four years at UCSB flew by.</p>\n<p>My two years as Sports Editor at the Daily Nexus went by just as quickly.

Any one of us, or our friends, could have been a victim on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Surround yourself with people you care about, and likewise care about you. Meet people who challenge and inspire you to improve upon yourself. Life is too short for anything less.</p>\n<p>This year has been a rough one for many at UCSB. Numerous stories and media coverages have engulfed our campus throughout the year, especially in the last week.</p>\n<p>However, despite all this, the resiliency and determination that comes with being a Gaucho has shined.</p>\n<p>The community’s responses and discussions regarding events this year makes me supremely proud to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>We care about our community and each other and I will miss the friendly faces on the streets of I.V. I have grown to love.</p>\n<p>Much of my love for UCSB comes from my time and experiences at the Nexus and with Gaucho athletics.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to cover the men’s basketball team for two seasons and met some extremely talented, humble and kind people in the process. Big Al, you are a beast and I hope to watch you in the NBA for years to come. Punish the Big West next year and bring the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>For all you Gauchos out there, please support our teams for the remainder of your college career. We have up-and-coming baseball, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams that I have had the privilege of covering during my tenure with the Nexus. Grab a few friends and head out to a game sometime; I promise you won’t regret it.</p>\n<p>I personally want to thank everyone at the Nexus for all the hard work and collaboration over the past four years. I also want to especially thank my co-editor Kristen for working with me these past two years. There’s no way I would have made it through all those late nights without the help and collaboration. We definitely made a great team and brought our own unique talents and preferences to the paper.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my brothers and sisters in Alpha Kappa Psi. You made college for me. You challenged me to improve and changed me for the better, and without all my experiences with you all, I would not be ready to enter the real world in a short few weeks.</p>\n<p>Lastly, thank you to all my fellow Gauchos for making these past four years the best of my life. Whether it was celebrating a Gaucho victory over Cal Poly or partying on Deltopia in the respectful way we know how, we had fun and we did it with class.

(Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Junior right-handed pitcher Dillon Tate was a dominating force on the diamond for UCSB baseball. His effectiveness and consistency throughout the season played a major role in the Gaucho’s success. Even with various expectations for his performance, Tate lived up to the hype as he ended the year with an ERA of 2.26, 8 wins, and 111 strikeouts. After having such a miraculous season full of rewards and accolades, he is currently projected to be a first-round pick in the 2015 MLB Draft. If so, Tate will become the first Gaucho in UCSB history to be drafted in the first-round.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Athlete of the Year: Katie Records (Women’s Swim)</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an exciting season for the UCSB Women’s Swimming team, Katie Records once again led the show and made a name for herself all year. Records received two MPSF Athlete of the Week honors, countless first place victories in her various races, and now is ranked within the Gauchos’ school record books for both singles and relay events. She finished her season with three individual 1st place victories at the MPSF Championships, earning her team 60 points on her own. This tied for the most points by any single athlete and was enough to help UCSB take 3rd place in the Championship meet.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Men’s Team of the Year: Men’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB men’s soccer returned to form this past season with a Big West regular season title and made it all the way to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Santa Barbara had a total of 12 wins on the season, making it the 13th straight year the program has accomplished double-digit wins for a season. The highlights of the team’s year include a 2-0 win against rival Cal Poly on national television and nine players selected to the All-Big West Team.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Women’s Team of the Year: Women’s Tennis</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Representing the ladies, Women’s Tennis takes the cake for Team of the Year, completing the sweep for UCSB tennis. Going 8-3 in conference, the Gauchos finished in second place in the Big West and reached national rankings as high as No. 50. Like the men’s team, the women found some momentum in the second half of the season posting an 11-2 record to close out the year that took it all the way to the final round of the Big West Tournament. Several players were awarded to Big West teams in both singles and doubles, as well as a few honorable mentions.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Coach of the Year: Andrew Checketts (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Head Coach Andrew Checketts’ devotion to his squad is what paved the way for UCSB baseball’s 40-win season this year. His dedication to make the players and program the best it can be has caught the eye of many within collegiate baseball. Not only did he lead the team to host its first NCAA Regional, but his bid to install new stadium lighting continues his goals of helping UCSB baseball gradually progress as a program. It’s without a doubt that Coach Checketts’ contributions to the UCSB baseball program are unmatched.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Freshmen of the Year: Gabe Vincent (M Basketball), Lou Adler (W Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When Head Coach Bob Williams saw Gabe Vincent play before he committed to UCSB, he knew right away that the freshman recruit would be the Gauchos starting shooting guard. Surely enough, Vincent did not disappoint as he earned Big West Freshman of the Year and was one of four players to average double-digits in scoring with 10.1 points per game. Throughout the season, he showed his ability to take over the game and deliver in the clutch with a game-tying three pointer against Southern Methodist and a game-winning bucket versus Hawaii. With Alan Williams gone, Vincent looks to be the program’s future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Coming to Santa Barbara, California from her hometown of Vaucresson, France, freshman Lou Adler has had a successful adventure in her first year at UCSB. Despite a mid-season injury, Adler was still able to break into national rankings at No. 93 and end the season on a three-match win streak. She played all of her matches this year for the Gauchos on the number-one ranked court and helped them to a phenomenal season that saw them reach the Big West Tournament Final.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Senior Standouts: Alan Williams (M Basketball), Shelby Wisdom (Softball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite being limited by a shoulder injury for a chunk of the conference season, Alan “Big Al” Williams still managed to be the most dominant big man in the Big West. Big Al earned his third straight Big West First-Team honor and became UCSB’s all-time leader in rebounds along the way. The double-double machine averaged 17.3 points per game and 11.8 rebounds, but it was his tenacity on defense and passing from the post that really separated him from other centers in the country. Big Al’s legendary career as a Gaucho may lead to his name being called in the 2015 NBA Draft on June 25.</p>\n<p>While an injury prevented senior Shelby Wisdom from wreaking havoc on the mound this past season, her UCSB career ends with an undoubtedly remarkable finish. She will leave Santa Barbara with the honors of being named to an All-Conference team in all four of her seasons and ranks within the top-10 of six different statisitcal categories in the Gauchos’ record books. The 2014 season was another milestone filled year as she hit a career-high .304 batting average and became the fourth player in UCSB softball history to hit 10 homeruns in a single season.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Game of the Year: 2/7/15 Men’s Basketball Defeats Hawaii 75-74</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">UCSB trailed by as many as 13 points against Hawaii, but down with five minutes left, the Gauchos hit four straight three pointers to take its first lead of the half. Holding on to a one-point lead with just seconds left, freshman guard Gabe Vincent hit a fade away jump shot to extend UCSB’s lead. Hawaii managed to tie the game with a second left, but upon review, Hawaii’s made three point shot was ruled only a two pointer, giving Santa Barbara a 75-74 comeback win in front of 4,383 fans in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Memorable Moment: DePuy Game-Winner (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Of midfielder Nick DePuy’s six game-winners this past season, perhaps none was more memorable than his first. With under a minute to go in a 0-0 draw against No. 3 UC Irvine at Harder Stadium, DePuy blasted in an incredible goal from 35-yards out to seal the win and get UCSB off to a perfect 2-0 start in conference play. The goal came in his first start of the season at forward – a position he would remain at for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Story: Andy Perez Loses Redshirt for Injury-Plagued Gauchos (Men’s Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before the beginning of the 2014 season, midfielder Andy Perez agreed to redshirt for his sophomore year, planning to develop his game more before using up another year of eligibility. However, numerous injuries along with a four-game winless streak had the Gauchos in fear of missing out on the Big West Tournament altogether. With just five games left in the season, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg turned to Perez to fill the void in a vacant midfield, believing that he could be the spark to lift the team to a Big West title. In his first game against Sac St. and in what he called “one of the coolest moments of [his] life,” Perez scored the opening goal, the first in his NCAA career, sparking a run in which UCSB went 3-0-1 to close the season and finish with the best conference record in the Big West.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Breakout Season: Nick DePuy (Men’s Soccer), Cameron Newell (Baseball)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nick DePuy didn’t start the year as one of UCSB’s primary offensive targets, but after making the move to forward midway through the season, he quickly proved that he probably should have been there a long time ago. The near-unstoppable forward notched a team-high 10 goals, including an insane six game-winners to lead his team to a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament. His performances earned him the honors of Big West Offensive Player of the Year and a pair of National Player of the Week awards.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many may not have expected his emergence, senior outfielder Cameron Newell led Big West leaderboards all season with a career-best, .368 batting average. He nearly doubled his total hits from last season and hit the only three homers of his Gaucho career during this past season. Newell also became the first Gaucho in team history to win the Big West Field Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Interview: Nathan Eshmade (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nathan Eshmade had been on a hot streak at home and had just taken wins in both singles and doubles to secure his team’s victory at a home match that was hosted by a sorority. On being asked if he feeds off of the energy of the home crowd, the Aussie native had this to say. “The crowds are great. I mean you got all these pretty girls out here, calling out to you, so you gotta look at them like, “YEAH!! I just won that point!,” and they yell back and you keep going off of the energy and that really helps us.”</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Best Looking: Josh Smith (M Swim), Savannah Francis (W Soccer)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A member of UCSB’s men’s swimming backstroke unit, junior Josh Smith has earned himself a charming honor. While he has had a great impact on the team with his performance in the pool, Smith’s achievements outside of swimming are impressive as well. He was selected as one of 160 participants to receive an internship at the Cannes Film Festival in France.</p>\n<p>Even when suited up in her women’s soccer uniform, junior defender/forward Savannah Francis is the other enchanting Gaucho to earn this award. Starting in 16 of the Gauchos’ 19 games, Smith ended the year with a total of two goals and one assist.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><strong>Most Badass: Morgan Mays (Men’s Tennis)</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you who wouldn’t think that a tennis player should deserve this award, you have not met Morgan Mays and luckily will probably never have to step foot on a court with him. For if you did, you would be first faced with a 120 MPH serve coming over the net at full force. And, if you were at all blessed to lay your strings on it, you would be faced with an even more deadly line-drive return powered by his aggressive baseliner style. Mays is a Bulldog and he will let you know when he barks at you following every point he slams in your face and onto the concrete. With the thunder that he brings to the court every match, there is no question why the man called “The Beast” is this year’s winner for Most Badass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/2015-nexus-sports-awards/","id":3258,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3257,3256,3255],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
