County Sheriff’s Office arrested four people wanted in connection with a home invasion robbery that occurred Jan. 29, 2016 on Madrid Rd. and Camino Pescadero in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4 p.m. on Jan. 29, second-year Carissa Garcia, 19, Palm Springs resident Kenyatta White, 19, and a 17-year-old male allegedly forced their way into the residence and began taking personal property of the residents. One of the suspects was allegedly armed with a souvenir baseball bat, according to the Santa Barbara Sherrif’s Office (SBSO). During the course of the robbery, one male victim sustained a black eye and another male victim broke his hand. Within the same night, SBSO identified a female driver of the getaway vehicle as first-year student Breanna Kromer, 18, and she was taken into police custody after a traffic stop on Embarcadero Del Mar. Kromer was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of robbery, resisting arrest and conspiracy. Public Information Officer for SBSO Kelly Hoover said one of the suspects was familiar with a resident at the location, and the incident “wasn’t a random crime.”</p>\n<p>Garcia was arrested the next day and booked into the jail on charges of first degree robbery and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 31, SBSO arrested White and the 17-year-old male after receiving an anonymous tip about their location at a residence on the 900 block of Camino Lindo. SBSO, along with I.V. Foot Patrol, attempted to contact the suspects, but the suspects refused to comply. UCPD officers set up a perimeter and contained the area. After entering the residence with the K-9 Unit, the officers were able to arrest and book White and the 17-year-old for robbery, conspiracy and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>White is still in police custody and is being held on $100,000 bail, according to SBSO. The juvenile was released with pending charges.</p>\n<p>Garcia is currently on a conditional own recognizance release (OR). Benjamin T. Ladinig, chief prosecutor for the case, said the court released Garcia on OR due to the recommendation of the Santa Barbara County Jail conditional own recognizance release/bail release (OR/BR) unit.</p>\n<p>According to the OR/BR report by the Santa Barbara County Superior Court, SBSO arresting officer said Garcia “made threats against the victim during jail phone calls.” Prior to Garcia’s release, alleged victims one and two provided similar input, with victim two saying he feared Garcia may return to the residence to retaliate.</p>\n<p>As references in the report, Garcia’s parents described her as “a good kid, trustworthy and very responsible,” adding they were unaware of Garcia having any issues involving alcohol or drugs. The references also expressed certainty that Garcia would appear in court and abide by conditions of release.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s bail was posted at $100,000, but Judge Clifford Anderson reduced it to $50,000 after the pretrial. Kromer posted bail and was released. Kromer was denied an own recognizance release “due to lack of reference input and unverified personal information,” according to the OR/BR report.</p>\n<p>Kromer’s father said in the report that she had “control” issues with alcohol and she “periodically uses marijuana.” Kromer’s mother cited past alcohol and drug use, not including current usage, and said the subject is in need of counseling. Kromer’s mother described her as “dependable, loyal and responsible” but said she is not currently taking her medication and is “headed down a bad path.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/feb/08/three-arrested-alleged-iv-baseball-bat-robbery/\">reported</a> that in court Monday, public defense attorney Mark Owens claimed Kromer received no medications during her time in jail. In response, Hoover said “there are several procedures in place when an inmate is booked at the jail and at no time was there ever any indication that there was medication that was prescribed to her. The first time the jail knew of this issue was during court.”</p>\n<p>The University was unable to provide a comment regarding the academic status of the students after the incident.</p>\n<p>Hoover said there is a possibility that drug involvement is a factor in the motivation for the robbery, but the case is under investigation.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing for Garcia, Kromer and White will be held Feb. 24 at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>*This article has been updated from its original form to protect the privacy of a subject of this article</em><em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/students-arrested-for-home-invasion-robbery/","id":3759,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3758,3757,3756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wrap-Up Nov. 9-16","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wrapup.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wrapup.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last week (Nov. 9-16), law enforcement units in Isla Vista responded to a case of domestic violence, two fights, a cliff fall and two break-ins.

While there were no visible injuries on either party, the suspect was arrested for domestic battery and booked into SBCJ</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also on Wednesday, law enforcement officers responded to a student who had fallen off a cliff at the corner of Camino Majorca and Del Playa. The victim, a 20-year-old male UC Santa Barbara student, was found conscious and breathing and was transported to the hospital. The victim survived his injuries. A friend of the victim told deputies the victim has taken LSD for the first time and was acting strangely. The friend said she had struggled to keep the victim from falling from the cliff before he broke away and jumped with his arms out, landing on his chest and head before turning over and lying on the beach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, two subjects were allegedly arguing in the middle of Anisq’Oyo’ Park about a chess match they had played earlier. The two became engaged in a minor physical confrontation, and the suspect smashed the victim’s Bluetooth speaker on the ground. The victim pressed charges for vandalism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also on Saturday, law enforcement responded to a report of a fight on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. Upon their arrival, a suspect had already been detained by other law enforcement. An interview revealed the alleged suspect had been in a fight with the residents of the address and broken in. The suspect, a Santa Barbara City College student, then punched one of the residents, prompting the victims’ roommates to aid him. They then pushed the suspect out of the apartment and called police for assistance. The victim made a citizen’s arrest on the suspect, who was charged with battery and trespassing before being booked into SBCJ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m., an unknown suspect entered a residence on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. through an open bathroom window and stole three laptops. One of the victims was asleep when the theft occurred. Neighbors in the upstairs unit said two unidentified adult males had knocked on their window at about 9 p.m looking to buy weed. The break-in is still under investigation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-67203\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Das Williams</p></div>\n<p>Assemblymember Das Williams introduced Assembly Bill 1564 (AB 1564) on Monday to quicken response 911 emergency call from cellphones by streamlining the dispatch process.</p>\n<p>The bill seeks to route emergency calls from cellphones directly to the appropriate emergency response center. Wireless emergency calls are currently routed to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) or local law enforcement first, which often delays response times by the following emergency response center. AB 1564 aims to create a program that includes the help of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), CHP, the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAPs) and wireless cellphone industries to guarantee people in emergency situations receive responses as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would have Cal OES conduct a comprehensive review of the cell sectors throughout the state in order to cut down emergency response times. Currently in California, wireless calls to 911 go through a CHP dispatch center, even when the caller isn’t near a freeway.</p>\n<p>“Locally, this means that a call transfer must be made from the CHP dispatch center in either Ventura or San Luis Obispo to a local PSAP (such as County Sheriff or County Fire covering Isla Vista) before a first responder is sent out to the scene,” Williams said in an email. “When it’s a life or death situation, additional seconds count.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Alyssa Sahu said her friend experienced inefficiency in an emergency because of the current system.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends that lives in I.V. once called the police to report a burglary that happened at her house and it took them around an hour to show up,” Sahu said. “I think it’s necessary to make sure this doesn’t always happen.”</p>\n<p>Williams said calls regarding the events of May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista were first answered by CHP dispatch before being transferred to local county first responders.</p>\n<p>“This is inexcusable when these emergency calls can easily be routed right the first time. We can’t afford to wait when lives are on the line as they were that night,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Williams said this issue is of particular importance to the central coast, because the 101 divides in half, forcing calls to go through an extra transfer step.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the 37th district is not part of the 13 percent of California with call sectors that are optimized to ensure calls be routed directly to the public safety force that responds most often to that area.</p>\n<p>“There are several examples of folks calling 911 in our area from a cell phone, and due to a misunderstanding by an out of town dispatcher, a lag in transfer time, or other mishap, the first responders are sent to the wrong house,” Williams said in an email. “There has even been at least one death in the Santa Barbara area in a situation like this.”</p>\n<p>Williams said “optimizing” call sectors is crucial for the 37th district.</p>\n<p>“Fixing the 911 system is absolutely a major legislative priority for me,” Williams said in an email. “I can’t think of anything more important than protecting the lives of my constituents.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67233\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/assembly-bill-seeks-to-speed-up-911-response/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67233\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/assembly-bill-seeks-to-speed-up-911-response/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/assembly-bill-seeks-to-speed-up-911-response/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/assembly-bill-seeks-to-speed-up-911-response/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/assembly-bill-seeks-to-speed-up-911-response/","id":3761,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3760,3759,3758],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
