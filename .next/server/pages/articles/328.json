Ware had the most immediate impact, scoring 14 points on a perfect 6-6 shooting night in just 18 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>After restraining UCI to a field goal percentage of 31 percent in their second meeting of the regular season, the Gauchos’ defense surpassed this performance, holding the Anteaters to a 25.8 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine concluded Tuesday’s game with a 17-66 shooting performance in addition to finishing 0-4 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Still, the Anteater’ play through the first three quarters of Tuesday’s game convinced many that a possible upset was in the works.</p>\n<p>It began with UCI possessing a 12-5 lead nearly halfway through the first quarter. The seven-point lead would go on to be the Anteaters’ largest of the game. Staying active for Irvine in the opening period was junior forward Mckenzie Piper with four of her eight points and five of her eight rebounds occurring during the period.</p>\n<p>However, Irvine was held scoreless for the remaining 5:37 of first quarter as UCSB went on a 5-0 run to close out the quarter with a tied score of 12-12.</p>\n<p>Neither team could score a basket to begin the second quarter with the first point of the period being at the 6:49 mark from a made free-throw by UCSB freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Newton managed to provide some offense in the paint with six points in the quarter but was matched in points by UCI junior guard Irene Chavez. The Anteaters’ leading scorer with 11 points, Chavez scored six of Irvine’s 10 points in the quarter but could not prevent UCSB from entering halftime with a 25-22 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes and two ties occurred during the third quarter. Tied 34-34, a layup by sophomore guard Makala Roper handed UCSB a 36-34 lead heading into the game’s final period.</p>\n<p>While the Anteaters recorded their best shooting percentage of 38.5 percent in the third quarter, they faltered in the fourth with a 15.8 field goal percentage to end the game.</p>\n<p>As UCI was plagued by its shooting woes, UCSB registered its best shooting performance of the game with a 52.6 shooting percentage in the final quarter. At the helm of the Gauchos’ late surge was Ware with 10 points to help lead UCSB to its 62-43 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to punch its ticket to Anaheim tonight with a matchup against No. 4 seeded UC Davis at 8:30 p.m. in the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-09/gauchos-advance-face-no-4-seed-uc-davis-tonight/","id":328,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[327,326,325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Achieve Season Sweep of Cal Poly, End with Eight-Game Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team extended its winning streak to eight games after defeating Blue-Green rival Cal Poly 69-50 on Saturday.

UCSB also shot 6-12 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did a pretty good job of shot selection and getting ourselves to the rim,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[Cal Poly] had an uncharacteristically bad shooting night from three and that gave us some separation in the game. We didn’t live at the three point line, we had some patience about getting the better shot and that’s when I think we’re a better team.”</p>\n<p>Never trailing at any point in Saturday’s game, it was the Gauchos’ fifth time in the last six games in which they led from start to finish. Santa Barbara has also held its opponents to a 35.8 shooting percentage during its eight-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward John Green had arguably his best performance of the season. Leading the Gauchos’ second unit, Green finished his final home game in dramatic fashion tallying in his first double-double of the year with a team-high 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Being able to bring John off the bench has been an unbelievable benefit to this team,” Williams said. “How efficient John has been the last two weeks takes us to a whole other level. People have to guard everywhere on the floor.”</p>\n<p>An uphill battle for last year’s Honorable Mention, Green missed all but four games his first three years under Coach Williams. Battling a series of foot, wrist and knee injuries, the redshirt senior has worked his way back to health and emerged as a major vocal point off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I look at my [injuries] as a learning experience,” Green said. “I just want to be a living testament for people and let him know that if you really love something don’t quit on it.”</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.7 points per game in the last three games, all of which he has led or come second on the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe had a strong senior night performance as well. The two combined for 17 of UCSB’s 20 points in the paint along with six rebounds apiece. After a few stagnant possessions on offense, Beeler beat his man down the lane and connected on a go-ahead dunk from freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak giving the Gauchos a 53-42 lead. This provided UCSB with much needed momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun playing especially when [me and Mitch] are productive,” Beeler said. “We work against each other every day so it’s great to see that work pay off for the both of us.”</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor and Dajuan Smith played some quality minutes and made an effect around the perimeter. Smith also contributed five points of his own, including a three-point shot from the top of the key with 11:59 to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly made a late push with 5:23 to go off a made three-pointer by guard Taylor Sutlive. The Gauchos quickly responded however, as Green dished a no-look pass to Brewe for a layup to give UCSB a seven-point advantage. From then on, Santa Barbara went 5-6 from the free throw line to finish out the game.</p>\n<p>Gabe Vincent helped seal the deal for the Gauchos. With just 34 seconds left in regulation, the sophomore guard pulled up from the top of the key rising over Minnesota-transfer Josh Martin and drained a shot from beyond the arc. Vincent tied Green’s performance registering 14 points as well.</p>\n<p>Senior David Nwaba led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a team-high 15 points while going 9-13 at the free-throw line along with grabbing nine rebounds. Nwaba was Cal Poly’s primary offensive target the first time these two teams faced, scoring 16 points in the Mustangs’ 76-73 loss at home on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>In addition to their regular season sweep of their Blue-Green rival, the Gauchos clinched the fourth seed in the Big West Conference Tournament. UCSB will face UC Davis in the Quarterfinal round. Tip-off will take place at 12 p.m. on March 10 at the Honda Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/","id":325,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[324,323,322],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos In Search of First Win Against SMU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB looks to avoid its worst start since 2000 when it takes on SMU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a tough start to the season for the UCSB men’s basketball team through the last three games this season, but the turnaround to try to make it successful could begin tonight as it faces off against Southern Methodist University in the second of its three-game road trip.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74305\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74305\" data-attachment-id=\"74305\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/gauchos-in-search-of-first-win-against-smu/mbball-161106-dustinharris-02-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mbball-161106-dustinharris-02-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74305\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-02-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=430%2C287\" alt=\"Looking for someone to pass to, Christian Terrell keeps the ball from the defense.

SMU’s win was the most recent as it beat UCSB 80-73 in an overtime match on Dec. 8, 2014. With only 10 seconds left in that game, guard Gabe Vincent nailed a game-tying three to send the game into an extra period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent has played a big role in the Gauchos offense since his arrival in 2014. The former Big West Freshman of the Year has averaged a team-high of 16 points per game to start the season including a 23-point effort in a loss to USF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the junior guard has hit his fair share of struggles this year only shooting 30 percent from the field and 24 percent from three-point range. Last year, Vincent had the same woes through his first three starts, shooting only 24 percent from the field before ultimately getting on track and shooting 40 percent by the end of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eric Childress will also need to be a key factor if the Gauchos hope to notch the first win of the season against a very tough opponent. Childress is coming off a career-high 14-point outing against CSU Bakersfield and leads the team in assists with four per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the biggest key for Santa Barbara will be taking care of the ball. Against the Roadrunners, the Gauchos turned the ball over a season-high 21 times, negating the fact that they outshot their opponents and outrebounded them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key will be to keep the energy high through both halves of the match. This year, Santa Barbara has been outscored 102-100 in the first half but 124-93 in the final half of games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing this, SMU will surely try to take advantage with their high-octane offense. In the second half of games this season, Southern Methodist has outscored its opponents 164-114, meaning the Gauchos will definitely need to be on high alert or the game could turn into a blowout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Mustangs average 73.2 points per game and are shooting an impressive 45 percent from the field and 36 percent from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Guard Shake Milton has played a big role in the SMU offense averaging 12 points per game and shooting a solid 43 percent from the field. The Oklahoma native was one of 20 candidates named to the 2017 Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award watch list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Semi Ojeleye will also be another player the Gauchos must be weary of. The forward was named American Athletic Conference Player of the Week for Nov. 14 after averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds in both games that week. Ojeleye leads the team in points per game with 20.3 and shoots a team-high 48 percent from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defeating SMU will not be an easy task but a necessary one if Santa Barbara wants to get its season on track. A big road victory would be something that could definitely boost the confidence of all the Gauchos, especially the young ones who are dealing with this type of adversity for the first times in their careers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on SMU at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 22 at the Moody Coliseum.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Gauchos last won the conference tournament during their 2012-13 run, in which they made history as the lowest seed (sixth) in Big West history to win the championship.</p>\n<p>Due to splitting its regular season series with Cal State Fullerton, who also finished with a 1-15 conference record, it was by virtue of winning a coin flip that UC Irvine clinched the eighth seed.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season with a 4-26 overall and 1-15 conference record, the Anteaters may be able to capitalize on their home advantage. But, this home advantage isn’t a guaranteed benefit for UCI after finishing with a 2-11 home record and ending the season on a 10 game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, contributing to its losing slump were two losses to UCSB as the Gauchos achieved a season sweep of the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>In two meetings this season, Santa Barbara defeated UCI by a combined point differential of 23.5 points.</p>\n<p>For the most part of this season, losses by a double-figure margin has been the tale for the Anteaters. They’ve managed to lose by a single-figure differential just three times this season and even allowed 126 points in a loss to Sacramento State in December.</p>\n<p>While statistics prove that UCI isn’t a great offensive team, shooting around 34 percent in both overall and conference play, UCSB’s defense has done an exceptional job all season long, especially against UCI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished third in the Big West in points allowed per game with a 63.1 average. Their stout defense improved in conference play as well, finishing second in the rankings allowing 61.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing a 40.4 field goal percentage in the first meeting, Santa Barbara forced 22 turnovers in the game and outscored the Anteaters 31-13 in points off turnovers to go along with 11 steals. The Gauchos continued their defensive dominance in their second matchup against UCI, limiting the Anteaters to a field goal percentage of 31 percent (18-58 shooting) and 14.3 percent from behind the three-point line. They held UCI to four points in the second and fourth quarters in the same contest.</p>\n<p>Still, just like any team in the country this postseason, UCSB cannot underestimate the Anteaters’ potential to pull off an upset Tuesday night. After making the decision to forgo her senior season, junior forward Mokun Fajemisin will be looking to make an impact in what could be her final game.</p>\n<p>UCI’s leading scorer and rebounder with 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, Fajemisin also leads the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 per game. She is coming off 16 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks in the team’s 76-70 loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will also face the Big West’s top playmaker in senior guard Raelyn Cheung-Sutton. She led the Big West in assists per game with 5.7. Cheung-Sutton remained consistent in conference play, averaging 5.5 helpers per contest. She enters Tuesday after registering a season-high 17 points and tying her career-high total of 12 assists in the loss to UCD.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s backcourt will deal with the task of containing Cheung-Sutton’s vision on the court, an improvement in play by sophomore guard Makala Roper is essential if the Gauchos plan on making a run this postseason.</p>\n<p>After starting in just six games her freshman season and averaging 6.5 ppg, Roper emerged as UCSB’s top scorer in her second year leading the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 ppg.</p>\n<p>Enhancing her increase in scoring was her range from beyond the arc. During the regular season, Roper ranked fourth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 38.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, as the Gauchos enter Tuesday 1-3 in their last four games, Roper has struggled during this span as well. She scored 10 points once during this stretch of games along with registering just two points in 19 minutes of play in the team’s final game at Hawaii last Thursday.</p>\n<p>But Roper’s ability to embrace the role placed upon her this season did not go unnoticed as she earned All-Big West Honorable Mention honors on Monday. Senior Jasmine Ware also was named to the Honorable Mention team while freshman guard Coco Miller was selected to the All-Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament is set to tip-off at 6 p.m. this Tuesday, March 8 at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/no-5-seeded-gauchos-to-face-no-8-seeded-uci-in-first-round-of-bw-tourney-tuesday/","id":327,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[326,325,324],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
