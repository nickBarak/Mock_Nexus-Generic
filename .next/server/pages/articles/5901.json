A woman in line for the panels could be overheard speaking about how, because it’s after the Oscars, the San Francisco festival she’s involved with gets a far shabbier turnout of celebrity guests than Santa Barbara’s. Indeed, every speaker on the back-to-back producers and writers panels is nominated for an Oscar this year, working on some levels to promote their films among the city’s menagerie of retired Academy voters.</p>\n<p>Though the writer’s panel was, unsurprisingly, the more compelling of the two, the speakers on “Movers &amp; Shakers,” the producer’s panel, shared some intriguing behind-the-scenes tidbits about their respective projects. Brooklyn’s Finola Dwyer spoke on the challenges of transforming Montreal into 1950s New York, and Mary Parent of “The Revenant” similarly remarked on the magic of transcribing the 1820s American Midwest upon the isolated snowy peaks of Argentina. Parent also quipped that it was the first production she’d been on that set an electric fence up around the caterers to protect them from hungry bears; fortunately, everyone on set avoided Hugh Glass’s grisly fate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both Jeremy Kleiner (“The Big Short”) and Steve Golin (“Spotlight”) discussed how their systematically challenging films are set to be screened for representatives of the very institutions they criticize, the former to a group of bipartisan congressmen, and the latter at the Vatican itself. On the topic of challenging institutions, the (all white) panelists very briefly, semi-awkwardly touched on the issue of the Oscars’ lack of recognition of diverse talent. Kleiner shrewdly noted, “The Academy is at one end of a long chain of decision making,” scratching the surface of the overwhelming bias toward white involvement in all aspects of film industry production. While it’s true that the Academy’s nomination decisions take place at the far end of this chain, producers’ roles are at the other; they acknowledged the problem without drawing any productive conclusions concerned with solving it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68152\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-68152\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1391039039\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"68123\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68152\" data-attachment-id=\"68152\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/sbiff-panels-_-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Writers Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68152\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-68152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Writers Panel</p>\n<p>An hour and a half after the producers panel, every seat of downtown’s historic Lobero Theatre filled up as the sold-out “It Starts with the Script,” the festival’s largest panel of screenwriters to date, started up. All but two of this year’s 10 writing Oscar nominees took the stage to share insightful perspectives on their content and their craft.</p>\n<p>Pixar legend Pete Docter (“Toy Story,” “Monster’s Inc.,” “WALL-E,” “Up”) explained how often, the crux of a story doesn’t materialize until well into the writing process. He described coming upon a storyboarder’s sketch of the characters Joy and Sadness hugging, with the inscription ‘embrace sadness.’ “Wow,” Docter relayed, “That’s the movie!” That small incident led him to the film’s central theme: “the deeper happiness that comes from its relationship with sadness.” “Ex Machina’s” writer-director Alex Garland expressed similar structural perceptions. “Stories are like maths in some respects,” he noted. “The equation might just not work.” His observations on managing the intricately balanced ecosystem of a story drew murmurs and nods of assent from the rest of the panelists. He said that once you’d worked out and balanced issues in a script, “it’s not like the problems are gone, but they’ve settled, like all the spikes have gone down.”</p>\n<p>The writers went on to discuss thoroughly the nature of adaptation. Emma Donaghue wrote “Room,” an adaptation of her own novel, and found it “hugely satisfying to take this story and tell it over again.” She was especially delighted in seeing her characters have physical bodies, capable of expressing human subtleties words themselves can’t sufficiently describe. Donaghue also brought up a difference between film and novel writing that rang with veracity for her fellow writers, in that “A book has so much more room, so much more time … Film has this narrative thrust; it moves forward.” Jonathan Herman, writer of “Straight Outta Compton,” sardonically joked, “I understand why they hired me, ‘cause I’m a white, Jewish gay guy from Connecticut.” In adapting NWA’s story for the screen, he noticed “a “Rashomon” thing going on,” with Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E’s widow, Tomica Wright, all reporting conflicting versions of the story. In addition to struggling to capture a semblance of true events, Herman faced a hurdle in convincing hip hop mogul Ice Cube to be comfortable with his character exhibiting moments of weakness. “This is the way a movie goes,” Herman explained. “You gotta have a low point and some vulnerability so you can come back from it, you gotta have an arc — the audience will like you more that way.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Short’s” Charles Randolph shared perhaps the most engaging perceptions on the panel. Regarding his emotional standpoint while writing the film, Randolph explained that he was disheartened by the events of 2008, as he’d “always had this nagging feeling that our system was fair, that there was a tangible connection between success and moral goodness.” He embellished on “Short’s” use of narration and cutaways to break down its economic jargon, used by influential bankers to “obfuscate and hide and empower themselves.” The techniques also added to the film a “meta layer which not only described the things, but gave the audience something beyond the characters to connect with.” Aside from the probing intellectual discussion, Randolph admitted to slacking off as much as anyone else. He agreed with Josh Singer’s (“Spotlight”) praise of research, adding, “The great thing about research is you can just read the most obscure crap and think at the end of the day that you did something.”</p>\n<p>Other writers shared their treatises on procrastination; as a writer, it was encouraging to hear that professionals, too, have less-than-perfect working habits. Charlie Kaufman (“Being John Malkovich,” “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”), writer of the existential stop-motion drama “Anomalisa,” shared that in terms of having a solid structure, “I tend to try not to. When I have an idea, I like to keep the idea of exploring it alive.” He has also learned to build downtime into his writing, observing astutely, “When I’m blocked or procrastinating, I’m still writing. I just don’t know it.” “Carol” writer Phyllis Nagy also owned up to exhibiting unorthodox writing practices. “I write with constant stimuli,” she said. “I have to have the TV on, I have to have the radio on.” Drew Goddard penned “The Martian,” and shared a quirky anecdote about how, since his wife writes comedy and he writes drama, they avoid both genres. Instead, they “just watch really bad reality television.” Thus, the inspiration for “The Martian’s” “turn the beat around” scene struck him while he and his wife sat in bed watching Bravo.</p>\n<p>The panelists all provided fest-goers with unique, intuitive, unexpected perspectives on what it means to write films, imparting on them a greater understanding of this year’s most lauded releases and the act of filmmaking itself as an art.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/","id":5901,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[5900,5899,5898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne","biography":"Not available","articles":[5894,5901,6085,6537,6736,6740,6797,6836,6841,6887,6896,6908,6982,7671],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"“Finest Hours” Interview with Casey Affleck and Ben Pine","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“The Finest Hours” premiered in theaters on Friday, Jan. 29.

The film tells the story of the rescue of the S.S. Pendleton, one of the most daring rescue missions in the history of the Coast Guard. When the ship is split in two by a ferocious storm off the coast of Chatham, MA, coxswain Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) sets out in a lifeboat in extremely treacherous conditions to rescue the survivors. Thanks to the efforts of Webber and chief engineer Raymond Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), 32 out of 33 of the Pendleton’s crew members were rescued. The <em>Daily Nexus, </em>along with several other collegiate publications, spoke with Affleck and Pine about the film:</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Daily Nexus:</strong> You’ve done quite a few films in the New England/Boston area. What exactly is it that draws you back to your hometown, and how did your familiarity with the area affect the filming process?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> That’s a good question. I guess I like coming back here just because I’m from here. It’s nice to come home. I’m in California for the time being so I can work; that’s where the industry is. But I’d much rather be here. Boston is also a great place to make movies ‘cause they’ve been making movies here for a long time. They’ve got really good crews there, which is not always the case. And you know, everyone’s professional, and also when the movie comes out and you run into the people who you made it with from Boston, people in Boston don’t mind telling you if they hated it. So it’s nice to know, you know, where you stand. And you don’t have to guess about whether or not they actually liked it or not. That was a joke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Growing up in Boston, were you familiar with the story of the Pendleton’s rescue before your experience with the film?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> I hadn’t heard it before. I’m not totally sure that it’s true. But they say it is, you know, and I guess that’s enough to make a movie, you know. When I — when I did a little research, I was skeptical. I went to the Coast Guard Museum and turns out it all really happened. It’s quite an amazing story. It’s great when you can find totally forgotten [stories] like this that really you could write a book about. You could bring cheer to the story in a lot of ways. But these days, movies are pretty great for making a spectacle, you know. All the amazing things that they can do now in movies. They can really bring something like this to life, the scale of which would be hard to imagine if it weren’t a movie. No matter how much I heard about it or read about it, I was still really surprised by how big the ship was and, you know, just like what that — to think how big those waves must have been to split a 500 foot Oil Tanker in half. It’s the kind of thing you want to see someone make a movie of so you can go watch it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Hey, I just wanted to know how the film being set in 1952, how that changed your approach to the performance?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> Well that’s a good question. There’s a lot of conversation about whether or not we try to emulate the style — the acting style — the movies from that period, because stylistically the movie looks and feels a lot like a movie from back then, albeit also sort of, you know, color and gigantic and sort of awesome in all of the ways that digital cinema is now. But in other ways, in the writing and storytelling, thematically, it sort of feels like an old movie. So should people behave that way as well? And we decided no. So really I just approach it like any other movie the as best you can.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Chris, you play Bernard Weber, who’s the main character of this film. What elements did you bring to your character to honor Weber’s legacy?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Bernie Weber … what I like about Bernie, at least from the script that I was given and — I didn’t know Bernie and really had only a sense of who he was from talking to Andy Fitzgerald, who was on the boat with him that night, and Moe Gutthrew, who’s his best friend, and there’s an autobiographical account that Bernie wrote about the night, and then obviously the book <em>The Finest </em>and a little audio clip of Bernie describing the events of that night. So that was — those were kind of the things that I used to cull an idea of who the man might have been. But from the script that I was given, he was a simple guy that loved his job and loved the waters … and knew what he was doing out there but was obviously affected by a tragedy that happened a year before and didn’t know if he was up for the task of going out that night. But I … do love the idea of a regular man up against seemingly insurmountable odds, and more than anything, I kind of related to Bernie’s fear, you know. Bernie is a man that wears his heart on his sleeve. And he’s not like many of us that, you know, put on all this armor and try to be macho and tough. He’s just — Bernie doesn’t — at least from the script that was given — doesn’t think that way. He just kind of wears his heart on his sleeve, wants to do a good job and loves his wife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Bernie’s character was a really huge rule follower in the film at the beginning. And then at the end, he kind of learned the limits of being a rule follower and kind of broke away from that. Were there any situations in your life where you have broken the rules or taken risks in acting or in life?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Nothing that comes to mind. But that seems to be that theme of, you know, we all like stories of the mavericks and the guys that, I don’t know, go against the grain, and I think what we enjoy about men like that is they usually operate from the sense of an inner moral compass. And I think part of Bernie’s evolution — it’s not that following rules are bad, it’s just that Bernie, by following rules so closely, had lost his voice, and by learning to speak up for himself and to trust his instincts, trust his gut, trust his knowledge of those waters, I think — I think that’s really good. The story there — and although I can’t think of anything personally that comes to mind — I think all those kinds of experience that on a daily basis, balancing ourselves, understanding ourselves, communicating ourselves and you know, looking at whatever social framework which tries to—</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> What Chris is doing there is he’s telling some of the bigger themes of the picture. It’s about the inner compass of a man. There’s the compass, they lose their compass, and they still find their way because there’s an inner moral compass that guides them. The guiding light here, for Disney, for Chris, for all of us: it’s selflessness, heroism in the face of 50 foot waves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Finest Hours,” which has been called a highly invigorating crowd pleaser and a tale of nautical derring-do, is now playing in theaters nationwide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/","id":5898,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[5897,5896,5895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Room’ Leaves Viewers Heartbroken","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Room-png.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Like many of the other astounding independent films that debuted in 2015, “Room” failed to gain attention prior to its release.

Despite the setback, the movie has managed to gather the attention of audiences across the world.</p>\n<p>In the past, director Larry Abrahamson’s films have failed to gain said attention; nevertheless, the film, “Room,” continues to receive acclamation from critics. Abrahamson developed his film from Emma Donoghue’s novel, <em>Room</em>. When writing the film Donoghue was hesitant about the novel’s on-screen biopic, afraid that it would simply be “a really soppy movie or pervy, grim, voyeuristic one.” Nonetheless, the film was electrifying, leading fans to experience a whirlwind of emotions.</p>\n<p>The movie stars Brie Larson as “Ma” and Jacob Tremblay as Jack, both of which have been presented with prestigious awards for their spectacular performances in <em>Room</em>. As Jack — an easily impressed five-year-old boy — speaks in amazement during the opening scene, the audience is shown scenes of him running around in amusement confined to a 10-by-10-foot room. Their lifestyle is introduced as being filled with tiresome habits, which becomes evident in seeing that Jack and Ma never leave the condemned area. However, the tone of the film shifts as it reveals that both Ma and Jack have been placed in this room due to a horrific nightmare scenario, causing the audience to embark on a journey filled with despair. Although this may appear to be a vital part of the plot, it pales in comparison to what the rest of the film has to offer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While in captivation, the protagonists develop a schedule that leads a young and vulnerable Jack to believe that he is in a safe environment. His imagination engrosses him in a make-believe world that has made him oblivious to the fact that his mother is living a life filled with sorrow. Furthermore, Jack’s narrow-minded habits manage to make the audience frustrated as they see he is incapable of handling the horrific reality he lives in; and yet, it is up to him to save what is left of his mother’s life.

As the film progresses, the audience is forced to separate from a setting, which has constructed a relationship with the viewers. The room is not only a place, but rather a significant part in the lives of both Ma and Jack. Throughout the entire movie, it is referred to as “room,” personifying it as if it were a name with feelings and memories attached to it, rather than simply being a place. Regardless of the fact that the setting changes drastically, the mood only escalates to breathtaking scenes, showing that Ma is suffering a mental breakdown triggered by leading a life filled with vile experiences.</p>\n<p>It is always difficult to believe that what goes on in movies can even come close to being slightly real. “Room” unravels an all-too-realistic situation filled with dire conditions, leading the audience to empathize with those that have to endure a situation similar to the one Ma and Jack faced. Viewers are guaranteed to have an epiphany sparked by the realism that is painted by Abrahamson. Room itself may be small, but the imprint it leaves is enormous.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/room-leaves-viewers-heartbroken/","id":5899,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[5898,5897,5896],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leo, Oscars and Bears – Oh My!","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-revenant-png.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-revenant-png.png?resize=944%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Poor Leonardo DiCaprio.

Five times he has seen golden statues march past him, and five times he has had to watch them fall into the hands of another.</p>\n<p>So now, in an attempt to finally ensnare an Oscar, he screams and wails as a man wearing blue spandex and a plastic bear head dangling above his noggin furiously shakes his arm to and fro.

After the company is killed down to a mere handful, Glass is viciously mauled by the aforementioned computer-generated bear and left for dead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Thus, a vast chunk of the movie is spent watching Glass slowly recover from his near-fatal wounds, allowing DiCaprio to utilize an entire spectrum of grunts, moans and screams. Spittle flies from his mouth in unnatural fashion, and his eyes glaze over in response to the innumerable traumas he is forced to experience.</p>\n<p>You can tell that DiCaprio physically and emotionally committed himself to this role to the point of being uncomfortable. Many are saying this performance will finally win Leo his Oscar. I’d say it’s entirely possible, as his performance doesn’t just convey a battered yet determined man, but does so in a completely compelling way. Hugh Glass is not a particularly layered character, but he is, without a doubt, engrossing to watch.</p>\n<p>And speaking of engrossing, you ought to see what is captured in-frame. The scenery of Midwestern America is so finely captured and immersive that if snow had started to trickle into the theater, I wouldn’t have batted an eye.</p>\n<p>Like “The Martian,” the film’s wide shots expertly and wordlessly convey how stacked the odds are against the protagonist. He is a dot against a vast, overwhelming landscape of snow and towering forests. Once you see shots like this, they go so far as to add to Glass’s character by making you realize just how determined he really is.</p>\n<p>Also, if “Birdman” (I’m not writing out the subtitle for that thing) taught us anything, it’s that director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, are masters of the long take. Unlike “Birdman,” the movie isn’t made to a look like it was done in one shot, but it is peppered with enough extended takes to evoke the feeling of a physical, theatrical production. They also forgo the eye-gougingly annoying cliché of shaking the camera during the action; everything you see is as clear as the icy rivers Glass drinks from.</p>\n<p>But if you’ll allow me to be blunt for a moment, let me say this: This film is fucking brutal. Nothing in this film is easy to swallow — not the introductory slaughter, not the mauling, not when Glass treats himself.</p>\n<p>The on-screen violence succeeds in shocking you not by becoming over-the-top to the point of hilarity like a Tarantino film, but by being unforgivingly, viscerally authentic. If you have a weak stomach and still want to see large bear fights, “Kung Fu Panda 3” just came out.</p>\n<p>So, I don’t know if I’ll see this again any time soon. “The Revenant” is undoubtedly in a master-class of filmmaking, but its on-screen violence is certainly not for the faint-hearted. Those easily offended might opt for something lighter, like maybe “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” Kidding. Here’s hoping a golden statuette finally lands in DiCaprio’s lap.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/leo-oscars-and-bears-oh-my/","id":5900,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5899,5898,5897],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
