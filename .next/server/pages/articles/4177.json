style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When going forward with the planning of this, I really wanted to just make it a space of memorial and remembering,” said Jeike Meijer, former Associated Students (A.S.) external vice president for local affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office has been working on recreating the original memorial events that students put together in the aftermath of the shooting. One of those recreations included putting up posters of the original blackboard messages that students left for the victims in 2014 by the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re basically replicating that this year because we wanted to bring back the initial reaction and memory of the five year anniversary,” Meijer added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vigil and walk from Storke Tower to Anisq’Oyo’ Park <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/281778196041141/\">taking place</a> on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. is also a tribute to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-25/isla-vista-community-gathers-to-mourn-share-memories-of-those-lost/\">initial vigil</a> that took place two days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president for the I.V. Community Services District, spoke about how I.V.’s  high turnover rate means it can be harder for students to learn about the tragedy when they first come to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My generation of students wasn’t here for the tragedy. And we were the ones who sort of were watching from a distance. I know I remember the day that it happened, I remember reading about it on the news and actually talking about it with my friends just because the details were so horrific,” said Brandt, who will graduate this spring with the class of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we keep talking about it and that we keep recognizing just the horror of what happened, because it is so important to how our community has developed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the sorority Delta Delta Delta, more commonly known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/tri-delta-to-suspend-operations-at-end-of-school-year/\">Tri Delta</a>, closing down at the end of this year and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/coffee-collab-mural-commemorates-tragedy/\">Coffee Collaborative</a>’s future uncertain, I.V. is losing some of the physical markers of remembrance people once used to learn about the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the months after the shooting, a memorial swing bench honoring two Tri Delta sisters who lost their lives in the shooting, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper, was given to the Tri Delta house. Coffee Collaborative has a mural dedicated to the six victims and has intentionally left a bullet hole in the window from that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every four years, we have almost an entirely new town in terms of the population and who lives here,” Brandt said. “I’ve been happy to see that at least in the instance with the Tri Delt bench that it’s found a home </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last that I heard </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with parents of one of the victims.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the student population at UCSB essentially resets every four years, many staff and faculty members who were here in 2014 are still here today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life, has been working at UCSB for 28 years and has worked to help the community heal for the past five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time this year, Armistead said, the Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (A.S.A.P.)  is putting together <a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/events/asap-may-23-iv-tragedy-commemoration-and-reflection-five-years-later\">an event</a> for staff members to “reflect, connect and nourish.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event is described as an informal space for staff and faculty members to come together and will be facilitated by A.S.A.P. Manager Kirsten Olson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t feel as cohesive because now we’ll be with students who are honoring and respecting and remembering, but they weren’t necessarily here,” Armistead said. “And so this space created for staff and faculty is pretty special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, arrived on campus during Fall Quarter 2015 and said it has “been a learning process for [her] in terms of what were the impacts and how have those changed over time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. might be losing some of its physical reminders of the tragedy, Klawunn pointed to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/\">lights in Pardall Tunnel</a>, which were installed as part of a memorial project in 2015, and the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/\">Love and Remembrance Garden</a> in I.V. as examples of how the community has created its own ways to remember and honor the victims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to acknowledging the experiences of faculty and staff members who were here in 2014, Meijer touched upon the experiences of the first responders who were there as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] some of them, that’s the worst night of their life. They were the ones there; they were the ones who were seeing everything happen,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As two students who weren’t at UCSB in 2014, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel said she and Meijer had been speaking to people who were at the university and could talk about the ways in which the community came together in the days after the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bringing that community back together when you’re remembering is really important and making sure that that legacy and that history is being passed down so that no new generation of UCSB students ever forgets what happened,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said that while people would talk about the shooting during the year, there wasn’t a “place to center yourself and focus on remembering the people’s lives” outside of the annual vigils.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to keep reminding students that this tragedy happened in their community just five years before is by holding these vigils and memorial events, Kopel and Meijer both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t want to present it in a way that’s gonna make people not want to see it or not want to remember, because healing in that way is always so hard,” Kopel said. “But I think that just by people walking past those boards, for example, maybe first years, they’re gonna stop and see it and they make initial contact with it once and they’re gonna now know that for the rest of their four years here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It really only takes one instance of contact or a story passed down or knowledge passed down for that to continue on. And I don’t think that people in this community are ever gonna forget that this happened.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

In those six games they were outscored 43-20.</p>\n<p>Being away from home is usually enough to get UCSB off its game, as it only has an 8-11-1 record; however, a close 4-3 win at UCLA this past Tuesday might have come at just the right moment so that it can go into the UCI game with some confidence.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the Gauchos have struggled immensely against the Anteaters posting a 14-28 record. It also does not help that Santa Barbara has not won a series at UC Irvine since 1986, but will definitely look to change that this year as its playoff lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>As most of these conference series go, the home team usually holds the advantage in terms of winning, as the past has consistently shown. Last season, UCSB swept UCI at home; two of wins had only one-run differences. However, two years ago when the series was at the Anteaters’ home, they swept the Gauchos in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>UCI will rely on its batting success to get it through this series, as it currently boasts the top batting average (.280), the top on-base percentage (.363) and the second best slugging percentage (.374) in the conference.</p>\n<p>One big factor in that is sophomore Keston Hiura, who has a .382 batting average, third best in the Big West. His home runs (seven) and RBI’s (37) are also third best in the conference, while his slugging percentage (.580) is the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s success in road games usually comes down to how the young pitching staff reacts to the pressure of the large road crowds. In their 20 road games this season, the pitching staff has allowed 91 earned runs compared to only 96 earned runs at home through 26 games.</p>\n<p>This month in particular, the inexperience and lack of depth has really shown itself, as the pitching staff has a combined 5.52 ERA, 54 earned runs and has allowed six home runs through 10 games. In the month of April, the throwing rotation had a 3.38 ERA, 53 earned runs and only four home runs allowed in 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the return of two solid pitchers from injury, redshirt junior James Carter and redshirt senior Justin Kelly, can help the struggling rotation. In his three appearances since his Tommy John surgery, Carter has been pitching five solid innings, allowing only five hits and no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>Kelly has also been solid as in 5.1 innings pitched he has allowed one run and four hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be no easy task for the Gauchos, but it certainly is necessary if they want to make a run at the postseason. They also need to get back to their winning ways so that if they make the postseason they can do more than just be one and done.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field on Friday, May 20 at 6:30 p.m., Saturday, May 21 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, May 22 at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game will be live-broadcasted on Fox Sports Prime Ticket while Sunday’s will be live on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In the fourth inning, the Gauchos were finally able to get on the board after a Kyle Plantier RBI single that brought them within four runs.</p>\n<p>After three more scoreless innings in the fifth, sixth and seventh, Bush finally struck in the eighth inning, hitting a grand slam to center field and tying the game up at five apiece. It was the first baseman’s seventh home run of the season and the first four-RBI homer of his young career.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover drove in the leading run, redshirt sophomore JJ Muno, for the Gauchos first lead of the game. It was Bush who struck yet again as he drove in three more runs with a double to left center, scoring Grover, redshirt junior Devon Gradford and redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher, making the score 9-5 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>That would end up being the final score of Sunday’s game after redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson picked up his seventh win of the season, bouncing back from a tough loss the previous night as he struck out two of the last three batters.</p>\n<p>Bush also became the first Gaucho to have a seven-RBI game in nearly 10 years as now UCSB assistant coach Chris Valaika hit seven against UC Davis on May 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before clinching a tough road series victory, Santa Barbara suffered a heartbreaking 5-4 loss that came down to the final pitch and a throw from Muno that was just off.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were up 3-0 early after scoring two runs in the second and one run in the top of the third frame before UCI countered with three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning courtesy of sophomore infielder Cole Kreuter’s two-RBI triple and redshirt senior infielder Grant Palmer’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters then took the lead after junior Adam Alcantara drove in a run to make the score 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game in the seventh inning thanks to redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s bunt, which scored Tevin Mitchell after a throwing error by the UCI pitcher.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UC Irvine had a chance to win the game in regular innings as it had the final opportunity in the bottom of the ninth. After loading the bases thanks to a single, a walk and a hit batter, Alcantara had a chance to drive in the winning run to go home winners or hit into a double play that would end the inning.</p>\n<p>The junior decided to go with the former and drove in John Brontsema to secure the 5-4 win. That, however, does not mean the play was not dramatic. Alcantara hit a line drive to left field, where third baseman Muno snagged it on a beautiful dive.</p>\n<p>Then an off-balance Muno tried to throw the ball to home plate to get the runner out but it was a bit out of the catcher’s reach and Brontsema was able to score.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLt1BhfzgbsF30dnjYcB4kmrtryqjRQ4U1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaker for the Gauchos and for Nelson, who picked up his second loss in less than a week after starting the season with a perfect 6-0 record. However, the right-hander was able to bounce back in Sunday’s game, proving why he is on the watch list for the top pitcher in the country.</p>\n<p>Before that gut-wrenching loss, UCSB was able to start the series off the right way and pick up a solid 10-3 victory to set the tone for the rest of the matches.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the top of the third, where UCSB picked up three runs thanks to Muno’s RBI single and Grover’s two-RBI single. UCI countered in the bottom of the frame with one run courtesy of Alcantara’s RBI single, making the score 3-1 after three innings.</p>\n<p>Both teams scored two runs in the fourth inning to keep the lead the same for the Gauchos now at 5-3.  In the sixth, UCSB extended its lead by adding a run thanks to Mitchell’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, Santa Barbara really did some damage, capitalizing on an error by UCI to score one run and a balk by the pitcher which scored another run, making the score 8-3.</p>\n<p>Calica would drive in the final two runs in the same inning thanks to a single to right field, making the score 10-3. Both teams were unable to score after that, making the final score 10-3 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber had another solid day at the office, allowing 11 hits and three earned runs but striking out 10 batters while pitching his fourth complete game of the season. Bieber (10-3) is now only the 12th pitcher in Gaucho history to reach 10 wins on the season.</p>\n<p>It was a solid weekend overall for UCSB, whose season is coming to a close.
