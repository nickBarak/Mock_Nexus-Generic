Known for his coaching legacy of 11 championships with the help of NBA greats such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, Jackson is hoping to return a sense of hope to the New York basketball scene at Madison Square Garden.</p>\n<p>Although the suggestion of New York being a “superteam” after its offseason additions by newly acquired former MVP Derrick Rose is far-fetched, the Knicks seem prone to make a postseason return with its roster improvements.</p>\n<p>In addition to receiving Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick in a trade with the Chicago Bulls for Robin Lopez, Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon, the Knicks most notable additions included Joakim Noah, Courtney Lee and Brandon Jennings within their total of seven signees along with two re-signees.</p>\n<p>While New York has revamped its starting lineup and added a little depth to its bench, its most important move was hiring new Head Coach Jeff Hornacek.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 101-112 overall coaching record after three seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Hornacek presents a refreshing change to the “in-house” approach Jackson has pursued in New York with ties to time spent with the Los Angeles Lakers in the hire of Derrick Fisher and the promotion of interim replacement Kurt Rambis.</p>\n<p>Certainly it will take time for the Knicks’ new talent to mesh together, but it’s the players’ potential to thrive in a system other than the “triangle offense” that Jackson has forced coaches to implement since his arrival.</p>\n<p>Able to return from a knee injury last season, Carmelo Anthony is preparing to enter his 14th NBA season in hopes of making a final push for a championship ring in the tail end of his career.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72012\" style=\"width: 218px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72012\" data-attachment-id=\"72012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-29/knicks-offseason-moves-may-remedy-recent-decline/new-york-knicks-vs-portland-trailblazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=1808%2C1205&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,1205\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72012\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=208%2C138\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of slamonline.com\" width=\"208\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/carmelo-anthony1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of slamonline.com</p></div>\n<p>Just once in Anthony’s career has he advanced further than the first round of the NBA Playoffs, enduring a 4-2 series loss in the 2009 Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers while with the Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>A ball-dominant volume shooter, it is no question that Anthony will remain the team’s primary offensive scorer. Yet his role will have to adjust a bit as he prepares to play with players such as Rose, a slashing and driving point guard, along with accommodating the growth of Porzingis in his second year.</p>\n<p>With a renovated starting lineup intact, concerns still remain toward New York’s reserves on the bench. Jennings and Lee should be expected to carry the load as Jennings possesses an unpredictable scoring edge and Lee is a decent two-way player.</p>\n<p>With few impactful options available to come off the bench, the Knicks remaining alternatives can be considered a work in progress with players such as Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Maurice Ndour, Marshall Plumlee and Guillermo Hernangomez.</p>\n<p>With no draft pick in this year’s NBA Draft after including its 2016 first-round pick in its trade with the Toronto Raptors for Andrea Bargnani back in 2013, the questionability of New York’s bench only increases as it gets no return after trading away last year’s first-round pick in Grant.</p>\n<p>No, the Knicks aren’t sudden title contenders. Inevitably, the Knicks decline in the past three seasons has resulted in their inability to persuade a superstar free agent to join their team and make them a top contender.</p>\n<p>But this offseason was the most productive pursuit of uplifting the lifeless franchise since the acquisition of Anthony in 2010. Nonetheless, it has become possible again for the Knicks to land in the middle of the pack of the Eastern Conference standings in hopes of bringing back the New York allure that has been absent in most recent years.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

With Hill and Exum receiving most of the playing time at the point, the Jazz will now offer 48 minutes of impactful defense at the spot where they started Raul Neto and Shelvin Mack, mixed with a heavy dosage of Trey Burke, in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Though Neto and Mack weren’t awful on that end, there’s no doubt that Hill and Exum will be a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Signing Joe Johnson for two years and $22 million is perfect for a young team in need of veteran leadership and shooting, both of which Johnson offers in spades. Some secondary and tertiary play initiation will be helpful for bench-heavy units, and Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors will easily mask his defensive deficiencies at the rim.</p>\n<p>Pair him with Boris Diaw (acquired from the Spurs in a move to clear space), familiar with Gobert from their time on the French national team, and the youthful team has two old heads to navigate the Jazz to a playoff return at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>The Jazz will struggle to keep up with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the perimeter, there’s no doubt, but dominating the Warriors on the boards and scaring them away from the rim has proved a decent tactic in the past.</p>\n<p>The Warriors kryptonite might be a more switch everything approach, with big guards capable of hounding Durant or Draymond Green in short stretches, or it might not exist at all, but the Jazz have added steady contributors to a roster already fairly well-suited to establish itself among the Western Conference elites, and as the Warriors’ toughest competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>7 Seconds or Less Comes to Houston</em></strong><em> </em></p>\n<p>The Rockets were a massive disappointment last season after many picked them as the second or third best team in the Western Conference. After hiring Mike D’Antoni, an offensive guru who’s not been able to duplicate his successful Phoenix Suns days in recent stints in New York and Los Angeles, Daryl Morey made a series of questionable moves, headlined by the particular signings of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71988\" style=\"width: 274px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71988\" data-attachment-id=\"71988\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/920x920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/920x920.jpg?fit=920%2C828&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"920,828\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"920×920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/920x920.jpg?fit=250%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/920x920.jpg?fit=888%2C799&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71988\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/920x920.jpg?resize=264%2C238\" alt=\"Mike D’Antoni has a career record of 455-426 as an NBA head coach.

Gordon will presumably come off the bench, though it wouldn’t be shocking to see D’Antoni start James Harden as his point guard next season. He’s a better offensive player than Beverley, more versatile and a better shooter, and D’Antoni has proven a strong defensive unit is not his priority.</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has the shooting that both Morey and D’Antoni crave at the power forward position, but back injuries have left his future in question. Anderson earning $21 million in his age 28 season is concerning, as the success of the contract will be totally reliant on his ability to stay healthy. He will open the paint for the Harden, Clint Capela pick-and-roll, a play with deadly potential on a spaced floor.</p>\n<p>The question for both Anderson and Gordon, teammates for the past few seasons in New Orleans, is whether or not they can contribute to a competent defense. The Rockets’ offense should be a joy to watch, but it’s not assured that Houston, juiced up on D’Antoni, will have a defense strong enough to stay much above 500. Harden should lead the team back to the playoffs, but a top-five seed seems like a stretch.</p>\n<p>Capela should be in store for a dominant breakout season; a talented rim runner, he has the perfect skill set to run the type of offense Dwight Howard stalled in his time as a Rocket. He’ll set strong screens for Harden, and has a knack for finishing inside, shooting over 66 percent at the rim in both of his first two NBA seasons.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/","id":3319,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3318,3317,3316],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rebuilt Teams Look to Contend for Eastern Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nets.celtics.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nets.celtics.png?resize=635%2C322&ssl=1","description":"Most NBA analysts believe that Cleveland is all but guaranteed to repeat as Eastern Conference Champs, however, Staff Writer Liam Bailey discusses the possibility of two teams posing a threat thanks t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=746%2C155\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"746\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>With Cleveland keeping most of their team in tact it seems as though dominating the East will be a forgone conclusion yet again this season and what awaits us is yet another Warriors-Cavs NBA Finals matchup, barring any massive injuries.

Marks added a lottery ticket at the shooting guard position in Caris LeVert, who showed the ability to score in bunches in his four years at Michigan.</p>\n<p>Though the lower body injuries that cut short his final two seasons are a concern, LeVert shot over 40 percent from three on over four attempts per game from his sophomore season onward.</p>\n<p>That shooting ability was paralleled by improvements in each of his four years in assists per game and assist percentage (an estimate of the number of teammate field goals assisted by a player while on the floor), the latter reaching 33 percent in his final season.</p>\n<p>With Rondae Hollis-Jefferson establishing himself as a defensive menace and an athletic marvel in his rookie campaign, the Nets are in need of someone at either the shooting guard or small forward to make up for his poor offensive game outside the paint.</p>\n<p>Enter LeVert, who should be able to grow with Hollis-Jefferson, cover up his shooting woes and allow the Arizona product to work off-ball cuts to his preferred areas more often as a result of potentially advanced playmaking at both guard positions.</p>\n<p>With the Boston Celtics receiving their first round pick in each of the next two seasons, adding LeVert gave the team another possible young building block.</p>\n<p>Speaking of guards, Sean Marks was able to acquire Jeremy Lin on a steal of a contract at three years, $36 million.</p>\n<p>Possibly eager to reunite with new the Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, a developmental wizard who was an assistant with the Knicks during Lin’s initial breakout, Lin took what seemed below his market value at an average of $12 million per season. Maybe the Nets were the only ones offering a starting job, but getting Lin for the next three years will give the Nets a competent starting point guard who could easily shift to a backup role if need be.</p>\n<p>Lin has shown the ability, both in Los Angeles and in Charlotte last year, to run an excellent pick-and-roll, with the speed to get downhill into the paint quickly and a strong shooting stroke both off the dribble and catch. He isn’t starting for a championship contender, but he fills the biggest hole on the Nets’ roster and gives them a reliable go-to play with a Brook-Lin pick-and-roll that will be difficult to stop in the regular season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71975\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71975\" data-attachment-id=\"71975\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/img25367215/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img25367215\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71975\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?resize=311%2C194\" alt=\"Jeremy Lin averaged 11.7 ppg coming off the bench in Charlotte last season.

Tyler Johnson and Allen Crabbe both received huge paydays with four-year contracts for $50 and $75 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though both offers were matched by Miami and Portland respectively, the two bloated contracts will limit the future possibilities for both franchises. In Miami, Johnson’s contract will count for just under $6 million against the cap during his first two seasons, before tripling in cost for the final two.</p>\n<p>Though Miami hopes it can hit big on free agency during those first two years, paying Johnson, Whiteside and Goran Dragic close to $70 million in 2019-20 will constrict those desires.</p>\n<p>Crabbe will earn around $18 million per season, slightly more than the recently signed Evan Turner. Crabb is probably best served as a backup shooting guard, playing alongside either Lillard or McCollum while the other rests, though this is a ton of money for that service.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Blazers have over $45 million invested in two players who harbor sufficient liabilities (defense for Crabbe, lack of outside shooting for Turner) to make both best suited for reserve roles.</p>\n<p>The Blazers hold few options moving forward, and with an extension for CJ McCollum uprising, they will likely be stuck with some iteration of this roster for the foreseeable future. Thanks to Marks’ aggressive moves, the Nets hamstrung two of the more dangerous teams in the league; Portland fresh off an impressive showing against the Warriors, and the Heat who are always a threat for a league-altering splash.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Celtics Get Their Man</em></strong></p>\n<p>Boston was finally able to lure a free agent to what has been a malaise of mediocre young talent and promises of a not-so-distant contender. Constantly propped up by the coaching of Brad Stevens, this odd collection of players was able to cobble together 48 wins in 2015-16, but clearly needed more offensive firepower apart from Isaiah Thomas in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Al Horford should perfectly complement this team, and vice versa; Jae Crowder will be an upgrade defensively from anyone who played small forward recently for the Hawks, likewise for Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart as point-of-attack stoppers who far exceed Dennis Schröder and Jeff Teague in that capacity.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71976\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71976\" data-attachment-id=\"71976\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71976\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Al Horford started all 82 games last season for the Hawks averaging 15.2 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko are also far superior three-point shooters to Millsap, offering Horford more space to operate during their shared time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the draft, the team reached for Jaylen Brown, impressed with his athleticism, ability to drive to the rim and seemingly high character. Though Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn and even Jamal Murray offered a higher floor than Brown, who held some of the worst statistical translations for such a high pick in recent history (Kevin Pelton), none shared Brown’s hydra-like ceiling on the wing, able to tenaciously defend four positions and get to the rack at will.</p>\n<p>The Cal product certainly struggles to fulfill that potential, however, as defensively his body is far more NBA-ready than his mind, and on the offensive end, his impressive drives end with missed lay-ups more often than made ones, and his passing ability is inconsistent. The flashes of a great player are there, and the Celtics are certainly a team with the flexibility to bring him along slowly, but it’s not difficult to see his career being a substantial disappointment.</p>\n<p>Ainge spent his next-to-first rounders on Guerschon Yabusele, a 20-year-old power forward from France who looked like an absolute tank in summer league and may come over this season, and Ante Zizic, a 19-year-old Croation center with vociferous energy who will stay abroad for at least one more year. Yabusele offers physicality and playmaking in a 270-pound package, and though he’ll require a ton of coaching on defense, it’s easy to picture him making a contribution in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The young supporting cast is perfect for Horford, as his post-30 career will be aided by a roster that mostly shares a positive age curve. Boston is still in need of another star, and for either Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown or one of the other draftees to show some serious juice.</p>\n<p>In an offseason where Celtics established themselves in the wrung below the Cavaliers out East, however, the move is a welcomed development for a franchise that was treading water, and can now consider itself a conference finals contender.</p><div

graduating from UCSB, former Gaucho track star Barbara Nwaba will be competing at her first Olympics in Brazil after winning the heptathlon at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon last month.</p>\n<p>Her gold medal at the Trials was only a stepping-stone for the Santa Barbara Track Club athlete, though, as Nwaba’s event score of 6494 means she is the sixth-seeded qualifier for the Olympic Finals, per the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), with a fighting chance at the podium.</p>\n<p>The thrill of attaining a goal is certainly not lost on one Nwaba who definitely has her focus but also wants to capture the moment of being at the Olympics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found)

compete and represent my country and being proud to be on this team knowing I made it after trying so hard for four years. I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be one of two Gauchos competing in the Summer Games, along with UCSB alumna and kayaker <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/\">Maggie Hogan</a>. Also traveling with Nwaba will be another familiar face to Gaucho athletics, Josh Priester.</p>\n<p>“I came into college as a hurdler and high jumper, and then Josh Priester, who’s still my coach now,” Nwaba said.  “I came in my sophomore year and he introduced me to the heptathlon, and that’s really what opened up the possibility of competing at the Trials and now the Olympics.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after her graduation, she joined the Santa Barbara Track Club, which was founded by Priester, a former assistant coach for Gaucho track and field. Priester, who specializes in coaching the multi-events (heptathlon and decathlon), now runs one of the premier running clubs in the country, training just down the coast at the Westmont College track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I’m] proud to be on this team knowing I made it after trying so hard for four years. I’ve seen all these girls [in the field] before and hopefully I can put up a big score and get on the podium. – Barbara Nwaba</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Westmont opened their doors to us, and since it’s NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics], the rules aren’t as strict as NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association]. Being in Santa Barbara is like paradise, like, why would I ever want to leave?” Nwaba joked after finishing the last event of the heptathlon in the customary Oregon rain.</p>\n<p>Nwaba has trained with Priester since her time at UCSB, and her growth has been massive. She has improved her personal record by over 500 points since setting the school record in the heptathlon with a score of 5989, remarkable for someone who became a multi-athlete just two years prior.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles native also holds the UCSB record in the 100m hurdles at 13.59, and is among the top 10 Gauchos in virtually every heptathlon event. Her crowning achievement in college, however, was winning the Big West Championship her senior year, a feat that earned her the title of All-American in her final season in blue and gold.</p>\n<p>When asked which win felt better, the Big West Championship or the Olympic Trials, Nwaba laughed.</p>\n<p>“Probably the Olympic Trials, although the Big West title was really exciting at the time,” she said with her ear-to-ear smile, which seemed to be glued to her face from the time she finished the 800m through the medal ceremony, media zone, and press conference, making no effort to hide her elation with the chance to compete at her debut Olympic Games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72047\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72047\" data-attachment-id=\"72047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=1272%2C848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1272,848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72047 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/457355_10150972190812835_501477834_11989523_639330051_o.jpg?w=1272&amp;ssl=1 1272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of ucsbgauchos.com</p></div>\n<p>After winning the heptathlon and securing her ticket to Rio, though, Nwaba insists she didn’t know how to react to her triumph until she spotted a familiar face in the stands waiting for her. Her mother, Blessing, traveled from Los Angeles to the Trials without telling her daughter in order to prevent any distractions during the most important meet of Barbara’s life.</p>\n<p>“The happiness kicked in when I took my victory lap and saw my mom in the stands, who I didn’t know was there, and that’s when the waterworks came down. Everyone came up from L.A., my friends, coaches, family,” Nwaba said before pausing for a sigh of relief, joy and anything else she may have been feeling in her victorious moment.“It’s such a blessing.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba will compete in four events Friday, August 12 and the other three the next day, August 13, with her eyes on the podium in Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, over 6000 miles away from the UCSB track, where her heptathlon journey began.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-track-star-aims-for-the-podium-at-debut-olympics/","id":3321,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[3320,3319,3318],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
