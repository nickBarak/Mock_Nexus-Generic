SB 295 requires the State Fire Marshal to perform annual oil pipeline inspections, rather than every two years. Under SB 414, the Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) must research the best utilization of commercial fisherman and other mariners as quick responders for oil spill containment. SB 414 also requires OSPR report chemical dispersant use to the legislature and research prevention and containment of oil spills.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 684 (AB 684) implements more efficient spill-prevention technology such as automatic shutoff systems, leak detection technology and sectionalized block valves in sensitive coastal environments. According to the bill, installation of these technologies will be complete by Jan. 1, 2018, and the State Fire Marshal will have adopted the necessary regulations to effectively assess risk analysis of pipelines by July 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes more frequent pipeline inspection could have prevented the Refugio Beach Oil Spill, as many pipeline failures are largely due to damage from chemicals added to oil for faster transport.</p>\n<p>“As oil has become more viscous and more problematic, there are more corrosive chemicals being used to thin it out so it can be transported more easily, and these are having a tremendous and detrimental effect on the pipelines,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said while the three bills are a “step forward” in protecting the environment from oil spill damage, oil production still poses as threat to surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>“As long as we have oil production in environmentally sensitive areas like those in Santa Barbara County, we live under threat of damaging oil spills,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double major Nicholas Frey said the bills are only temporary solutions to the greater problem of fossil fuel dependence.</p>\n<p>“While they were good, it was just kind of putting on a little Band-Aid to a much larger problem,” Frey said. “I would’ve wanted to see more transitioning out of fossil fuels and actually removing said pipelines.”</p>\n<p>UCSB CALPIRG campus organizer Alena Simon said California needs further legislation that transitions it toward alternative energy.</p>\n<p>“I think we’d like to see California go 100 percent renewable and not actually rely on these dirty fossil fuels at all,” Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said California should seek renewable energy “as rapidly as possible.”</p>\n<p>“We can work to make pipelines safer, but as long as there is oil drilling there will be oil spills,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>EAB Co-chair and second-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said he hopes legislators continue to pass legislation to impose tighter controls on the fossil fuel industry prior to another oil spill, rather than in response.</p>\n<p>“It stinks for me that we have to have these spills before we can pass tougher legislature on oil and fossil fuel industries,” Berry said. “I’m glad to see them passed, and I think frequent checks will be better … because it’s never if a spill’s going to happen, it’s when, so hopefully they can be checked and prevented.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

California in the coming months, bringing wet weather and the possibility of increased erosion along the cliffs of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>El Niño is a climatic change that occurs every two to seven years near the equatorial Pacific region. The 2015 El Niño has already affected climate patterns and ocean temperatures in the Pacific region. While winter weather across the country will feel the effects of El Niño, California and other Southern states in particular will experience atypical weather conditions and heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of earth sciences Alex Simms said the predicted heavy precipitation may lead to increased erosion.</p>\n<p>“There are higher rates of erosion during El Niño,” Simms said. “If you have one of those houses that is already hanging off the cliff, things are probably going to get bad for you.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of geology Charles Jones said El Niño is caused by a change in atmosphere that leads to warming waters and heavier moisture.</p>\n<p>“An El Niño is an interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially the tropical oceans,” Jones said. “It has a reoccurrence time of about two to seven years and it has a lot of natural variability.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the upcoming El Niño is predicted to be the strongest in nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>“Some forecasters think that it might be similar to the ’97, ’98 El Niño, which was the strongest El Niño on record,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and I.V. resident Molly Morrison, who last year led a campaign to install safety fences along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive, said she is concerned heavy rains may cause damage to the cliffs.</p>\n<p>“I’m not so concerned about the fences as I am about the actual cliff situation,” Morrison said. “Whether the fences can stand or not I don’t think is really the question, but whether the cliffs can.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said even without increased precipitation levels the cliffs are subject to significant erosion each year.</p>\n<p>“On average, the cliffs on this side of Isla Vista are supposed to erode about a foot a year,” Morrison said. “It will be interesting to see, if El Niño does pick up, in winds, velocity … how it will increase cliff erosion rates.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Connor Dodds said though he lives in a cliffside house on Del Playa, he is not concerned about El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be any big deal,” Dodds said. “When it’s high tide, the waves have already been hitting the cliff and it hasn’t really been doing much.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and Spanish double major Connor Kulg, Dodds’ housemate, said he looks forward to the improved surf that will come with El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Kulg said. “I’m not looking forward to the rains, but I am looking forward to the big waves.”</p>\n<p>Simms said the cliffs have been eroding for many years, and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>“This process has been going on for thousands of years, and there is nothing we can do to stop it,” Simms said.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-65273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Castro Valley Business</em></p></div>\n<p>Community leaders in the unincorporated area of Castro Valley, California, have been following Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 in the interest of pursuing a model for self-governance similar to Isla Vista’s.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 proposes the formation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. While unincorporated areas such as I.V. and Castro Valley receive municipal services from their county, a CSD is governed by a board of local representatives that decide what services to provide to residents using local tax revenue.</p>\n<p>Traditionally CSD’s are formed through Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO), but both unincorporated areas have found that LAFCO’s model for a CSD does not fit each area’s respective needs. AB 3 bypasses LAFCO by establishing a CSD though state-level legislation. Castro Valley Matters, a group advocating for self-governance in the northern California community, have been closely following the bill, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law last week.</p>\n<p>According to Castro Valley Matters President Michael Kusiak, the group has followed AB 3 since Williams first introduced the bill to the Assembly in December 2014.</p>\n<p>“We’re kind of crazy people up in northern California who have been following what’s been happening down in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista,” Kusiak said.</p>\n<p>An I.V. CSD as outlined in AB 3 would be funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills. Kusiak said a UUT is an “innovative means” of funding self-governance in unincorporated areas, because LAFCO often rejects CSD proposals on the basis that they are not financially feasible.</p>\n<p>“Our contention is that any unincorporated community that tries to go to LAFCO at this point will be told, ‘Actually, no, you’re not fiscally viable,’” Kusiak said. “Isla Vista is really special. It’s really interesting. That’s why we at Castro Valley Matters are following it.”</p>\n<p>Castro Valley Matters Vice President Michael Baldwin said the group is interested in a “virtual town” model, which combines a CSD, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and an Area Planning Commission (APC). According to Baldwin, no area has attempted this model, but I.V. is “as close as it comes.”</p>\n<p>“I was advocating to have a ‘virtual town’ model, which is basically what you guys did — to have a CSD that covers the whole town,” Baldwin said. “Nobody has ever done all three together — no ‘virtual town’ model.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said the self-governance process in Castro Valley has been “a lot slower” than in I.V., and their few group meetings have led to participants “talking in circles.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the opposite of what’s going on down there,” Baldwin said. “You guys got together and figured something out and pushed it through.”</p>\n<p>Kusiak said AB 3 can serve as an example of local governance for unincorporated areas that are unable to attain cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think it sets a precedent not just for Castro Valley but for all unincorporated communities,” Kusiak said. “I know it only applies to Isla Vista, but it tells our state legislature that unincorporated communities can be given alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Baldwin said when he called William’s office after AB 3 was introduced, staffers told him not to market the bill as a model for other unincorporated areas seeking self-governance for fear it would invite opposition.</p>\n<p>“They kind of said, ‘Oh no. Don’t publish that actually. We don’t want people to think its precedent even though it kind of is,’” Baldwin said. “They were worried that if the legislature saw it as a precedent they might not pass it.”</p>\n<p>Williams said some are “scared to death” AB 3 will pave the way for other areas to circumvent LAFCO when working toward self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that, with the opposition to AB 3, much of it was based on that it could be precedent setting,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill was specially made for I.V. and he does not intend to replace the LAFCO process throughout California.</p>\n<p>“At no time in this effort have we taken on or criticized the LAFCO process for the entire state,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said Castro Valley Matters’ support demonstrates I.V.’s role as a progressive and innovative unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>“As far as governance for an unincorporated community, it shows that our community is a very forward-thinking one,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said I.V. should support other unincorporated areas such as Castro Valley.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be important for Isla Vista to share its experience now to other communities who need that help,” Abboud said</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 only seeks approval of I.V. residents, not in the recognition of those outside the area.</p>\n<p>“The real legitimacy of the government doesn’t rest with people outside the community,” Williams said. “It rests with the people in the community making the decisions themselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-66805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a public meeting Tuesday in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss which services should be the first to receive funding if I.V. becomes a Community Service District (CSD) in the Nov. 2016 county elections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday’s meeting was the fifth of 11 meetings the Initiate organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in a CSD. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, the group of about 15 attendees made provisional plans to spend $119,000 out of the $255,000 they expect to have after the CSD’s administration costs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The CSD’s budget for funding services would come from revenue from a Utility User Tax (UUT), as stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group tentatively decided to ask the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to approve the following budget: $50,000 for hiring a grant writer, $30,000 to begin developing a new parking program, $25,000 for a tenant-landlord mediation program, $8,000 for a Municipal Advisory Council (M.A.C.) and $6,000 to remove graffiti, possibly by painting murals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy CEO of Santa Barbara County Martin Erickson said forming a CSD in I.V. through AB 3 might lead to more cooperation between the university, county and I.V. governance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think part of AB 3’s existence is going to have the County and UCSB look at this area differently and [result in] more partnerships,” Erickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Organizer for Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said although the CSD will have a relatively small budget, it will be able to make significant improvements in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the CSD is it’s going to do things and those things are going to have an impact on Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “These things are not going to cost very much, but they’re going to do a lot for the community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliott said the group’s tentative planning served an important purpose, even though it did not result in an official budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not just all out here running around like crazy … we are figuring it out now, we do have plans already in process; we are ready for governance; we can do this,” Elliott said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said spending $50,000 on a grant writer would be a good decision because it could yield a positive return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems like a very good idea because that’s a position that could generate several times its cost,” Ebenstein said.</span></p>\n<div

should request funding for a new parking program because UCSB might also help fund the initiative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think UCSB has expressed great interest in facilitating the funding of that service [parking],” Schunk said. “I think it would be really important to include some level of funding for parking initially because we know UCSB wants to pay for it.”</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group plans to discuss funding for a new police program and increased lighting of public parks and sidewalks in I.V. at future meetings, the next of which will be held Dec. 1 at 6 p.m. in the Isla Vista Clinic building.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:
