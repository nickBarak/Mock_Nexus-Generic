Community Service District (I.V. CSD), hires houseless people and pays them $15 an hour for various cleaning and landscaping tasks, according to Emily Allen, the United Way nonprofit’s director of Homeless and Veterans Impact Initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was homeless, they hired me for this, now I’m not homeless,” Moomey said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said he works around 20 hours a week, responding to the numerous service requests by users of the SeeClickFix app, which can range from graffiti cleanup and cutting overgrown weeds to removing Lime scooters on sidewalks. Anyone can download the SeeClickFix app, take photos of a nuisance in Isla Vista and someone — possibly Moomey — will fix the problem.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since working as the local beautification specialist, Moomey said that he has seen a tangible change in the community, in part from the work he has done so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of the homeless individuals here. Well, I guess I inspired them; they see what I’m doing picking up trash, doing landscaping stuff. They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This is the second of the six consecutive home series Santa Barbara has over the next month and a half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host the Bobcats with just an 4-7 overall mark but does boast a solid 3-1 home record. The visiting team is 7-4 on the year and has played just one road game this season, against Rice University, and lost 8-6. This is the first ever match-up between these two programs.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into this weekend with a very exciting possibility. While difficult, if it could sweep Texas State, then it would be back to an even record at 7-7 and just like that it is back to being in a power position to try to get back to good form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>What will Santa Barbara need to make this happen? Simple, it will need good pitching.</p>\n<p>In their four wins this season the Gauchos have given up an average of three runs per outing. In their seven losses, they have given up 6.71 runs per game. Conversely, in wins, UCSB scores 7.35 runs while in losses it only bats in 3.3 runs per game.</p>\n<p>Overall, the key word for Santa Barbara is consistency. If it can become a more consistent team in all facets of play then it will have much more success. Being at home certainly helps a young team like them to become more consistent.</p>\n<p>At home, the ‘Chos bat .307 at the plate, .394 slugging with and have a .404 on-base percentage. They also have double the RBI’s at home (22) then on the road (11) despite having played one less game in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Strikeouts have also been a problem for UCSB this season especially early in the season. After it’s first series of the season, Santa Barbara already accumulated 35 strikeouts. Additionally, UCSB has struck out 79 times on the road compared to just 22 at home.</p>\n<p>If the point hasn’t been driven home already, it is that Santa Barbara has a really good opportunity not just this weekend but in its next 18 of 19 games which will be at home.</p>\n<p>Key players that the Gauchos have relied on this season at the plate includes redshirt juniors Clay Fisher and Thomas Rowan.</p>\n<p>Despite not having been fully healed from his injury to play his normal shortstop position, Fisher has not missed a beat when up to bat. He currently slashes a very efficient .306/.340/.388. Rowan is the teams leader in batting average hitting .333 at the plate. He and Fisher are the only two Gauchos batting above .300.</p>\n<p>For Texas State, their normal Friday starting pitcher has been a beast which will make it difficult for the ‘Chos to get the first victory of the series. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Nicholas Fraze currently owns a 2-1 record and has a 0.93 ERA and 18 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Senior Dylan Paul has been getting it done for the Bobcats on the offensive side of the game. Last weekend, he led the Bobcats at the plate with a .545 average (6-for-11).  The utility also added in four runs and hit a walk-off triple in the series finale.</p>\n<p>For the season, he leads the team with a .395 (17-for-43) batting average. The 2018 Preseason All-Sun Belt Conference First Team has also batted in eight runs and holds a solid .938 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has 18 of its next 19 games at home and so far it has taken advantage of that opportunity but it cannot stop there. UCSB is still a program on the rise despite a sub-par last season but that will not be true forever if it cannot return to its former glory.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Texas State in the first of a three-game series at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 9th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

But winter break brings a decrease in customers, and despite the density in population, college students can turn out to be a much more difficult demographic to break into,  Yamasaki explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yamasaki, this is because students often have limited resources and have a higher standard for what they are willing to spend money on and the value they are getting. Businesses struggle to meet this standard at a price that pays the bills, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high cost of living also makes it hard for businesses to have sufficient time to establish the roots they need to develop a following, especially for smaller businesses, according to Darien Nisbett, marketing representative at Woodstock’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would imagine it is difficult to generate the sales necessary to pay your employees a living wage and eliminate turnover in that sense as well,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, winter break brings the challenge of finding people to work; UCSB or Santa Barbara Community College students make up the majority of employees — Nisbett said students make up 90% of employees at Woodstock’s, which means they often go home for breaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the store can bring more benefits than keeping it open; maintaining a healthy store is not simply about cash flow but also maintaining an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take this time to update the restaurant … [We] see an increase in business in-store from families in the surrounding areas and businesses in Goleta, as well as deliveries,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. Yamasaki said he has noticed an increasing number of students who choose to stay over break. And as these businesses have developed a more consistent customer base, they can rely on some of these students to still support the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We stayed open almost the whole break and we gained some understanding that many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international and out-of-state students are still here. They appreciate having some place to hang out and eat,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides winter break, summer also proves challenging to businesses, which often find profits to be cut in half for three months out of the year. But this trend appears to also be shifting slightly, according to Yamasaki.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot more students seem to be taking summer school. The UC keeps admitting more students and I think it encourages just generally higher populations and people that will visit during the summer,” Yamasaki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, one way for unestablished businesses to manage and learn to thrive in I.V. year round is to refine methods during breaks and summers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not even the initial capital to start a business, but the capital it takes on your personal life to really almost be a martyr to the business for a few years until it establishes those solid roots,” Yamasaki added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/","id":4286,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[4285,4284,4283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose to CSUN Friday 6-4","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall short against CSUN Friday, but get revenge Saturday, winning 12-0 to shutout the Matadors and even the series.

Junior Michael McAdoo and freshman Drew Williams advanced to third and second on a throwing error by the Matador starting pitcher. Junior Sam Cohen sent a single to right field to bring Williams home while a sacrifice fly from freshman Jason Willow would score McAdoo for his 28th run of the year.</p>\n<p>Freshman Brandon Bohning opened the third inning with an extra-base hit and junior Trevor Casanova would hit a sacrifice fly to bring Bohning home after he advanced to third during the previous at-bat. Casanova earned his 28th RBI of the season and brought his team to within one run of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Chris Lincoln started the game for the Gauchos and would only go as far as the fourth inning. With four hits allowed and two earned runs the right handed pitcher, did as well as he could in minimizing the damage from a couple of mistakes on the mound. The sub-five inning start is Lincoln’s first since a Mar. 17 appearance against Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>The Matadors scored a pair of runs in the fifth and sixth innings to gain and pad their lead. Casanova came through for his team again and more specifically his teammate Bohning who would cross the plate again on his single to the right side. Senior Nolan Bumstead would single in Casanova in his at-bat before UCSB was able to get out of the inning down a run, 4-3.</p>\n<p>Senior Alvaro Rubalcaba singled to right center to score senior Riley Conlan before Bohning would get an RBI of his own to score Rubalcaba, and put the tally at 6-3.</p>\n<p>Junior Thomas Rowan would crush a ball over the right field fence in the bottom of the seventh inning for his third homer of the season. The longball put UCSB behind by two, but the deficit was too much to overcome and were not able to put any further damage on the CSUN starter.</p>\n<p>Junior Walker Armstrong went the distance against the Gauchos, giving up four hits and three earned runs over nine innings pitched. The complete game is the right handers second of the season and the marathon effort was good enough to earn him his second win on the year. Despite getting into trouble early on in the game, Armstrong was extremely successful in being able to bear down and prevent UCSB from mounting enough momentum to try to make an attempt to take back the lead after giving it up.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play the Cal State University, Northridge Matadors  on Saturday, May 5 at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/","id":4287,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4286,4285,4284],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
