Senate meeting on Wednesday. This requirement has been lowered several times to compensate for low voting turnouts in the previous Fall Quarter External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, 612 students have voted. With only a week until voting closes, the election is still over 1,000 votes away from meeting the eight percent requirement.</p>\n<p>Initially, two students declared candidacy in the special election: Rachel Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, and Richard Zierer, a fourth-year political science and English double major. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Jan. 23, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>If the election meets the eight percent threshold, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ng-is-sole-candidate-remaining-in-evpsa-special-election/#search\">center her agenda</a> around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>To meet the voter threshold, Ng plans to utilize social media and class announcements. She believes that the lack of voter turnout in the previous EVPSA elections was due to voter burnout.</p>\n<p>This is A.S.’s third attempt to elect an EVPSA since Spring Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>A fall quarter special election occurred due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification of Mayela Morales</a>, a fifth-year global studies and Chicano and Chicana studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the EVPSA position in April, but she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, resulting in her subsequent disqualification.</p>\n<p>Madeline Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, was the sole declared candidate in the Fall Quarter special election. During that special election, however, the 16 percent voter threshold was not met and as a result, Loudon was not voted in.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board spent $50 on the Winter Quarter special election, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Voting for the winter special election opened on Thursday, Jan. 24. Voting closes on Thursday, Feb. 7, and results will be announced that evening.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at simren@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Senator Candidates to Debate Issues Ranging From Public Lighting to Mental Safety</h3>\n<p>During the Associated Students On-Campus and University-Owned Housing Senator debates, senatorial candidates for the 2014-15 academic school year congregated in the Hub yesterday to discuss their views on specific campus-related issues as well as proposed solutions and future plans.</p>\n<p>The panel consisted of 10 candidates, equally split amongst the Open-People’s Party (OPP) and the Democratic Process Party (DPP), collectively picking apart various subjects such as flaws in the dining commons and the overall effectiveness of A.S. Each candidate was allowed 30 seconds to a minute for each question asked, giving them time to argue both their party’s positions and their own personal platforms.</p>\n<p>The panel lasted for a duration of one hour and began with the discussion of the more pressing and pertinent issues on campus, with safety being first discussed.</p>\n<p>Daisy Fernandez, a first-year sociology and feminist studies major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said she sees the need for increased safety on campus through increased implementation of lighting structures. She suggested installing light structures near the tunnel by Student Health and the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>The candidates also discussed physical and mental safety of the students against issues such as homophobia and intolerant attitudes of prejudice or discrimination. According to Unique Vance, a first-year environmental science major running for On-Campus senator with DPP, students should not feel worried about the security of their own homes at UCSB and should receive consistent services that ensure their safety.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people feel unsafe in their own dorms and their own homes, and that should not be an issue,” Vance said. “I really want to include more safe places for students in their own homes so that they can feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Also at the debate, candidates discussed UCSB students’ well-being as well as higher availability of exercise classes at the Recreation Center and workshops on health. In addition, they touched on the topic of food quality in the dining commons.</p>\n<p>Emani Oakley, a first-year political science major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said the dining commons should accommodate more students by serving special nutritional needs, such as gluten-free diets.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I would do to improve health and wellness would be to provide more nutritional facts,” Oakley said.</p>\n<p>Tension arose within the debate when the topic of A.S.’s effectiveness and its potential improvements was brought up to candidates. Steven Kwok, a first-year economics and accounting major running for On-Campus Senator with DPP, said the organization is not quite as “associated” as he believes it should be.</p>\n<p>“To me, Associated Students … should be an organization associated with its students. But right now, it’s not doing its job,” Kwok said. “So I think how Associated Students can improve is to stop making promises it can’t keep.”</p>\n<p>Along the same vein, Alonso Martinez, a first-year mathematics major running with DPP, said he feels A.S. needs to increase efforts of transparency so students know more about their organization and their works.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make sure that the Associated Students is more transparent — that people know what’s going on,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Finally, the debate ended with short closing statements from each candidate. Third-year film &amp; media studies and black studies double major December Brown, for example, used the time to sum up her goals and restate her purpose in running for University-Owned Housing Senator with OPP.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is our home, and I would love to be a voice for all of our people,” Brown said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/","id":3030,"author":{"id":187,"name":"Daniella Chung"},"related":[3029,3028,3027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Her health journey over the past year inspired her to make healthy eating options more accessible for UCSB students as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t believe that we have enough restaurants or establishments to build healthy, nutritious meals, and even if they seem healthy, they’re not always the healthiest option,” Karmes-Wainer said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer used the petition as a way to gauge the community’s response to the hot bar as a potential senate project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What first began as a class project quickly transformed into a platform for students with a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences to voice their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged people from other communities that I didn’t realize that I was targeting as well,” Karmes-Wainer said. “That’s the point of my position, is to hear from all my different constituents.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer’s petition elicited plenty of responses from its post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Moser, a fourth-year environmental studies major at UCSB, said his dietary restrictions made finding food on campus difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a celiac, it’s hard to find many gluten-free meal options on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just random misc snack items.

Karmes-Wainer noted that the construction of the bar would not be completed by the end of her term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m dedicated to go through with the project throughout my senior year even though I won’t be on senate,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Isabell Liu is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/","id":3031,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[3030,3029,3028],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Queer Commission Fees To Appear on Upcoming A.S.

It also facilitates educational outreach initiatives regarding LGBTQ members to the general community and has helped in putting on drag shows, educational workshops and lecturing and speaking events.</p>\n<p>Out of the $2.12 collected in the Queer Commission’s new fee, $0.53 will be for a 25 percent return-to-aid, $0.10 will be for a 7 percent administrative assessment collected on all non-capital expenditures, $0.01 will be for the 1 percent A.S. recharge fee and $1.48 will be given directly to the Queer Commission.</p>\n<p>According to Dave Whitman, Interim Director of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), the Queer Commission hit a “breaking point” last year when its budget was proposed to be cut to an “all-time low.” Whitman said the group decided to propose the fee initiative to tackle these budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“This year, instead of going to Senate to ask them to not approve the cutting of their budget anymore, they decided to go straight to the entire student body for support,” Whitman said. “This way, the student body can decide collectively if a strong Queer Commission is valuable to this campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the Queer Commission Andrew Farkash said the purpose of the initiative is to not only gain funding to hold events but also give students a chance to attend LGBTQ national conferences for education and personal growth.</p>\n<p>“It teaches students about a lot of different issues and gets them more involved in the activism, in the commission and in the community in general,” Farkash said.</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, the lack of funding for the Queer Commission has negatively affected LGBTQ organizations on campus by impacting regularly held events, activities and meetings.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to give out less money, so it’s kind of hurt their events because the Queer Commission exists mainly to support the queer community and the different queer organizations,” Farkash said. “We’re also hurting … their ability to have regular events, to have regular meetings, to keep interest in their members, to advocate on campus and so on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/","id":3032,"author":{"id":188,"name":"Dustin Chan"},"related":[3031,3030,3029],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
