For those who are stuck in quarantine, the struggle of food shopping only magnifies, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faced with the puzzle of supplying community members with food while also keeping them safe amidst a pandemic, Cohen said the co-op sidestepped potential health hazards by </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing the shopping</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its customers through an online order system while working with food distributors to keep products on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described the last few months of keeping the co-op afloat as “a profound journey of dismantling, reestablishing, recalibrating, reinculturating, repurposing and recentering.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as Costco might’ve been easy or useful to deal with or Sprouts was a resource before, they’re not resources now. Corporate grocery could not help UCSB in [its] moment of need,” she continued. “I bet you don’t realize the power of having a community grocer right in your back pocket.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest advantages of running the co-op, as opposed to a corporate grocery store, is its lack of a corporate hierarchy, Cohen explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The uniqueness of being a small business at this time is very powerful,” she said, referring to the co-op’s flexibility in rolling out new rules and policies instantly without the need for higher-up approval. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op leveraged this advantage in March, when out-of-towners flocked to the store after wiping clean the nearby Costco and Sprouts, Cohen said. She immediately implemented mask-wearing policies and purchase limits to keep a lid on the panic buying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of a sudden, the co-op was descended upon by non-students who are buying hundreds of dollars worth of stuff at one time when we’re used to, like, a $10, $15 shopping basket,” Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Overnight, the co-op was discovered as this off-the-beaten-path treasure as all these supermarkets have these crazy lines and people are freaking out, and then suddenly people are shopping at the co-op,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the panic buying, Cohen said the loss of a third of her workforce — the part-time </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students who left I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ride out the pandemic at home — was another symptom of the pandemic’s toll on the co-op. But her remaining staff, despite being “worked to the bone,” stepped up to meet the demand, she said; at its peak, sales at the co-op were up nearly 70%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To offset the burden of working during the pandemic, Cohen said the co-op has been paying all employees hazard pay — including $2-per-hour raises and cash bonuses — since March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the co-op’s new safety protocols include new rules for sick leave, a mask-wearing policy for workers and customers, cleaning guidelines and performing administrative work remotely, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen also said she is grateful for the </span><a href=\"https://davisfood.coop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis Food Co-op</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the I.V. Food co-op’s sister store up north, for sharing its pandemic response plan and giving the co-op an adaptable blueprint for future plans and protocols, and for Churchill, whose sanitizer orders sounded the alarm about the necessity of preparing the co-op for the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen said these efforts provided an added layer of security to the store by making customers and workers feel safe while inside the food co-op. But when it comes to the food supply chain, which is largely out of the hands of the co-op, some uncertainty still looms, according to Steve Snyder, the I.V. Food Co-op’s merchandising manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line, he said, is that the “food supply chain was robust until people lost their minds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the third week of March, the panic buying was so intense that customers were buying items straight off the delivery truck before they even hit the shelves, Snyder said. This briefly forced the co-op to put in orders to its food distributors that were twice its normal size, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So the panic buying, the hoarding, the desperate desire to get it before your neighbor gets it — that’s what broke the food supply chain. When [they] recommended that people remain calm, that is what we all should have done,” Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There would be toilet paper on shelves if every person in North America, who could get four cases of 96-count toilet paper, didn’t go out and do that and build a fort in their garage,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder said there are currently a variety of holes in Southern California’s food supply chain, which is one of the largest and most impacted grocery regions in the U.S. Some of these gaps are reflected directly on the co-op’s shelves, where products such as rice, pasta, soup, toilet paper, bottled water and frozen fruits are either slowly returning in quantity or still out of stock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the food co-op is connected directly to growers around the state, Snyder said the quantity of some items, mainly produce, is not a concern. But when it comes to sourcing products from manufacturers and vendors — adding more layers to the supply chain — availability becomes more of an issue, Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some warehouses used by </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-06-09/coronavirus-pandemic-food-supply\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers and vendors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to store products have bled dry from panic buying, Snyder said. This means that “they’ve either sold through everything and they have to wait for the 2020 harvest to begin reproducing for staples … or they haven’t sold through everything but they’re allotting shipments to specific warehouses to make sure that everybody gets a chance,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judging from his experiences during the coronavirus pandemic, Snyder said he’d down boil what he learned into two takeaways for the future: “Try to figure out how to not get caught off guard” and “put quantity limits in place sooner.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that people would recognize that everyone should have access to food. And you’re not helping anyone, including yourself, if you’re buying a year’s or more supply of stuff,” he said. “That’s going to sit in your garage and eventually go stale, and then you’re going to send it to the landfill.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cohen, the pandemic may have been full of learning experiences, but it was also a catalyst for growth. She recalled being wary of starting Co-op Curbside, the co-op’s grocery delivery service, but grew to appreciate the convenience — and necessity — of having such a service after seeing how it unified community members during a time of need. Now, she says, the co-op has immortalized the service and she can’t see the store without it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had said, ‘I think doing home delivery is ridiculous. The co-op is place-based and people need to come to the store; it’s about the experience,’” she said. “And, of course, I’ve been proven wrong.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can also be said for hazard pay, Cohen said. Now, $15 per hour is the new normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the strenuous months of March, April and May, Cohen said the pandemic has been a bumpy road for the co-op, in part because the store lost some of its identity in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a place that prides itself on helping customers “feel safe and be seen,” Cohen said closing down the outdoor patio, canceling upcoming workshops and rolling out safety protocols made it all the more difficult to do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But through it all, the community response has been “incredible,” Cohen said, pointing to moments of appreciation from new and long-term customers who saw the value in the co-op’s grocery delivery service and cleaning protocols and found comfort knowing that there would always be food on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a small business with a generational stake in I.V. and a community of fervent supporters, Cohen is confident that the “new normal” will make the co-op stronger than ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you haven’t lived and loved Isla Vista and gone through your part of your life here, you will never know the magnitude of this community,” she said. “One of Isla Vista’s most magnificent attributes is that it is a community that is resilient and inspired. And every time we turn to the next calendar cycle, it’s a blank canvas — an opportunity for the next generation to show that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For us to get to be a part of this iteration of Isla Vista and feel like we’re actually doing work that the community is benefiting from — to me, there’s nothing better,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It’s just so hard for us to have visibility in Isla Vista, on campus, no matter where, which is why I chose to walk through DP to Sands Beach,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demonstration is not being organized in collaboration with any student organization, as Sanders said he felt that tying the demonstration to a specific organization — or even “too much to myself” — could come across as “performative” and take away from its purpose of standing up to racial injustice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he hasn’t worked out the specifics of the demonstration yet, Sanders said community members and UCSB faculty have been helping him organize it. Sanders said he’s been working closely with Mhoze Chikowero, a professor in the history department, who has guided him in structuring the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing the video of Minneapolis police officer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sanders said he immediately felt “clenched with anger and disappointment” and took the day off from school to gather his feelings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was tired of being here and not doing anything, and I had to turn my sadness into educated outrage,” he said. “And I felt like the only way that I would be able to relieve that is through reaching out to the community and starting something like this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting the information for the demonstration on Thursday night on Twitter, Sanders said he was only expecting about 30 to 40 people to be in attendance. But now, “hundreds of people might show up”; almost 1,000 people have liked Sanders’ post about the demonstration on Twitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This kind of all happened really fast. I wasn’t expecting as much community support for this to really take off like that,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also keeping the coronavirus pandemic in mind, as they are wary of spreading the virus through I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and former A.S. senator who reached out to Sanders to help organize the demonstration, spoke at a special Senate meeting on Friday asking senators to attend the march and said he would be there passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Dumlao said that he reached out to Sanders after seeing his tweet about wanting to organize a demonstration and offered to make flyers with QR codes to pass out to people who might not know what the demonstration was about, in addition to passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I work at Pardall Center and we are distributing masks, Mondays and Tuesdays 11 to 1 p.m., and because we have so many right now, and obviously it was gonna be a big gathering, I asked my supervisor if I could pass [the masks] out and I just got clearance,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that since the event is a march, it’ll be easier for people to maintain a safe distance from people they don’t live with, and that organizers plan to make an announcement before the march reminding people to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Dumlao said he offered to lead a group of non-Black people to be liaisons if police officers got involved and “things got heated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeyVibe5/status/1266510405288919040\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Twitter that he had been in communication with UCPD and said that officers told him that “they will not attempt to impede or stop the protest as long as it remains peaceful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demonstration scheduled to take place in less than a day, Sanders said it is his hope that the event serves as a reminder to “subscribe to the acknowledgement of [keeping] the Black community at your heart and to keep standing up against racial injustice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t pick and choose when to be an activist or when to support Black people. It has to be an all-the-time thing for sure,” he said. “Even if [this demonstration] encourages like five people to always be aware of the struggles that Black students go through and gives Black students the feeling of being seen here in this community, that’s definitely the goal of this whole thing.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Courtesy of Katherine Price</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going away for college meant spending Ramadan away from home, but Muslim students made it a priority to foster their own sense of community in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, these students have been scattered back to their hometowns, some celebrating with their families for the first time in years, while others have stayed in Isla Vista, spending the month markedly more alone than usual.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salman Sadak, a third-year biology major and vice president of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), spent Ramadan in his hometown — his first Ramadan at home since coming to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s very nostalgic in that it gives me a feeling of the Ramadans of my childhood, like breaking the fast with my parents and family and waking up at 4 a.m. helping my mom cook,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadak said that many members of the MSA talked about how much they miss having Ramadan on campus because of how it brings them closer together. Despite the pandemic, the MSA has still been holding its weekly general meetings on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It isn’t just like a one-day event, it’s like an entire month, and you see these people every single day kind of out of necessity because you gotta eat.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At night, when they would have normally gone to the mosque for what Sadak describes as both a social and spiritual experience, they instead view a live telecast that the mosque provides.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m still getting that spiritual connection, and even though we’re all separate, we can still livestream the prayer, pray with the imam, still get that ritual in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to gather in-person is one of the cornerstones of celebrating Ramadan, and despite celebrating at home, physical distancing requirements have made this Ramadan different from many students’ childhood celebrations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huda Faiz, a third-year biology major and former MSA president, is currently at home, and said the connections with others were missing this year compared to normal years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually we go to the mosque at night for prayers and whatnot, and it’s kind of nice to connect with community and see all your family, friends and everyone in one place, but that’s kind of missing,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for it, Faiz said that some people have even decorated corners of their homes to resemble a mosque. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said she usually travelled back home for Eid al-Fitr to attend a celebration with her family at the Muslim Community Association, a large mosque and community center in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll all dress up and we’ll go do our prayers there,” Faiz said, adding that most of her relatives live in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll meet all of them and take part in the festivities,” she said. “Now, there’s nothing going on … visiting people is really big in Eid and you go and you visit all your family friends, so that’s definitely missing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tala Alawwad, a second-year biochemistry major, spent Ramadan in Isla Vista. For the most part, she would break fast alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes I did eat with friends, just as dinner for them but breaking my fast for me, and that was fine,” Alawwad said. “Home for me is in Abu Dhabi … [my family is] just home and together, and that’s usually how it is … and at least they have each other to be spiritual and engage with the traditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Price, a first-year linguistics major and the secretary of the MSA, would have been celebrating her first Ramadan with other Muslim UCSB students this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were going to have all of these iftars, all of these dinners set up like four out of the five days of the week; we would have restaurants coming in and catering all of this really good food,” Price said. “It was going to be really exciting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the pandemic began to shut down campus, Price said she had to start calling and cancelling all the orders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the iftars would often draw close to 100 people, with not just undergraduate students in attendance but staff, faculty and graduate students as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was super festive, super fun … and we really missed out on a lot of that,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the MSA has held interfaith iftars on campus, inviting other religious organizations to break fast with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iftar is not just something for the Muslim community to take advantage of, but we also use it as a moment to get to know our fellow UCSB community and Isla Vista community, so it kind of makes me sad that we don’t really get that opportunity this year, but hopefully next year,” Sadak said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to online classes also provided some Muslim students with more flexibility, as balancing their fasting with a full day of being on campus was often draining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In past years, Sadak had trouble during evening classes and labs which did not allow students to eat, therefore preventing him from breaking fast during class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With online classes, it’s been more chill,” Sadak said. “Just being at home … it’s just been a lot more manageable, and I feel like professors are already really understanding about the whole COVID situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had an exam at a certain time right when I would have to break my fast, and I talked to my professor about it and he was understanding because, you know, it’s like everyone’s already dealing with so much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz added that walking around campus all day usually left her in a “fasting fog,” in which she was more fatigued and was not able to concentrate on anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With classes being recorded, now that they’re online, I can kind of shift my whole sleep schedule and rest a little bit during the day and watch more of the class videos at night,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Alawwad felt that online classes were actually more draining than in-person classes during Ramadan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I would try to occupy myself, go to classes, see people, kill time … you’re not thinking about the hunger as much as you are sitting at home,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Faiz, being at home and indoors most of the day has made breaking fast easier compared to being at school, especially since she breaks fast with her family, a built-in community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s friends, I feel like we’d all have different schedules and sometimes it’s hard to find a time that matches for all of us to get together,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being stuck at home, Faiz, Sadak, Alawwad and Price all said they dressed up to celebrate Eid. Sadak celebrated with his family in his backyard, and Allawad called her family on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought my dress months in advance,” Price laughed. “I was so ready for it, I was gonna show off.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
