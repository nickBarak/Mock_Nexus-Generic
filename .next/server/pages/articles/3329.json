He started by describing how the center, then known as the Queer Resource Center, was first started by a group of student activists in 1999 after the death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The students] organized to convince Chancellor Yang, who was here then and is still here now, that we needed a specific resource center for LGBTQ students. At the time that MCC existed, as well as the Women’s Center. But there was no university-funded space for LGBTQ students,” Leets explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff members then began a video call with former students, staff and activists who had worked with the center in the past, all of whom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflected on the activism involved with the RCSGD to celebrate it.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabrina Kwist, dean of equity and inclusion at Los Medanos College, who was a key part of the activism behind the founding of the RCSGD, was on the call and spoke to attendees about the experience of creating the center.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kyle Richards, the director of the RCSGD from 2002 to 2007, the center was originally located on the third floor of the University Center (UCen), next to University and Community Housing Services — Leets said that this was why the kickoff was held in the UCen as opposed to the center’s current location on the third floor of the Student Resource Building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The center was on] the third floor next to the community housing office and it was a small lounge and an office with a desk and a little library and then some sofas and that was about it,” Richards said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was during my time here that we moved over … That was when the Student Resource Building was first built and we were one of the first tenants that moved into it when it was opened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also during Richards’ time as director that the center changed its name from the Queer Resource Center to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, citing concerns that “queer” was inapplicable to people who did not identify as such.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a concern that the word ‘queer’ may be off-putting to some people, or they may be scared or didn’t identify as queer. So we wanted a name that was more inclusive to people, that felt like a broader terminology that was more representative of the greater community,” Richards explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He joked that despite the center’s name change, “RCSGD” wasn’t quite the nice, quick acronym they had hoped for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Richards, during the center’s early days it only had a very small budget to work with, so the center would partner with other campus organizations such as the MultiCultural Center and the Women’s Center to bring in speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it was a queer-related theme, then we would co-sponsor it with them and add it to a programming calendar of events that we would distribute. We would cross list things; that’s how we kind of maximized what we did, by partnering with other campus offices. That was the main way,” Richards said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the kickoff isn’t all the center has planned for the 20th anniversary. During Winter Quarter, the center will have 20th anniversary keynote speakers — to be announced in the coming weeks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— for its trans revolution series, Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also added that the center plans to invite alumni back to its annual drag brunch and will finish up the year by inviting alumni and past center staff for a dinner that will “recognize the history of the center.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the kickoff event, Leets announced the launch of a photo installation project for the outside of the director’s office at the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you post [photos] on social media and use any one of these four hashtags, we will use those at the end of the year to create a permanent photo installation that will live on in the center, similar to the mural that was created for the 15th anniversary,” Leets said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets added that he hopes to expand on the services offered by the center — referencing the recent initiative by the center to implement pronouns across several university systems — and to continue making the campus a more inclusive place for LGBTQ+ people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a vibrant community within our lounge here in the Student Resource Building — [we’re] trying continually to make UCSB be a welcoming place for all LGBTQ+ people.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 were present at Wednesday’s UC Santa Barbara strike. The workers set up their base at Storke Tower but spent much of the day marching around campus in order to draw attention to the union’s demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 — which represents more than 24,000 health care and service employees across the UC system — has been embroiled in contract negotiations with the university for the past two years, and one of its primary demands has been an end to outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This strike was AFSCME 3299’s sixth at UC campuses across the state in the past two years — a point of frustration among many of the workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a custodian at UCSB and an AFSCME 3299 member, said that he was “disappointed” with the number of strikes but added that he felt the only way the university will change its behavior is if the union keeps striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we’re out here again on unfair labor practices has me a little disappointed about making and impact on the way they follow the rules, but I think the only way that we’re ever going to make a change on that is by keep coming out,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paco Garcia, a senior lead laborer in facilities management at UCSB and an AFSCME member, added that union workers “don’t make the cost of living.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t make enough money to live in Santa Barbara, they don’t make enough to go on with their lives, they have to take two jobs,” Garcia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outsourcing is causing people to not have a steady job; it’s causing people to not live at the cost of living, and we want the university to stop breaking the law,” Garcia added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is currently considering a motion that — with a few exceptions — would prohibit outsourcing and adopt contracted workers to the UC’s payroll if they have been working for the UC for over a year. On Wednesday night, the UC Regents Governance Committee approved the motion; it will now move on to the Board of Regents for a vote. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91267\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/afscme_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91267\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91267\" data-attachment-id=\"91267\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucs-largest-union-strikes-for-the-third-time-this-year/afscme_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AFSCME_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE_9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91267\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 filed six complaints against the UC on Nov. 1, which primarily alleged unfair labor practices such as outsourcing and accused the university of cutting costs by contracting with private companies to do work which could be done by union workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It saves money for [the university] because they don’t have to pay for pensions, they don’t have to pay for benefits, the contractors that they’ve contracted out with have lower pay,” said Babe Gonzalez, an AFSCME member who works as a medical assistant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of outsourcing has been at medical centers on campuses like UC San Francisco and UC Los Angeles, rendering UCSB a school where outsourcing has a relatively smaller impact, Gonzalez added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, much of the outsourcing is in custodial work, which Garcia said could be performed by staff. AFSCME uses strikes as a bargaining tool, he added — the strike forces the university to hire more people to replace the strikers, which in turn provides the UC incentive to listen to the union’s demand that they end illegal outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite AFSCME’s insistence that the strikes are about the illegal outsourcing complaints, UC Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon called the strike a strategy to gain “leverage in negotiations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon added that the union ultimately wants double the wages of other employees and said AFSCME 3299 utilizes the strikes as a mechanism to achieve that goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite union concerns about contracting, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually grown by double digits in the past five years,” Gordon said. “UC’s contracts with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting, and no employee can be terminated as a result of a subcontracting decision.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike saw a degree of student solidarity, such as from Wendy Santamaria, a fourth-year political science and philosophy major, who attended the strike alongside her fellow Students for Bernie organization members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see it as absolutely crucial for us as students to come together with workers,” Santamaria said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as we keep spreading knowledge of the issues workers are facing, [support for the strike] is going to continue to grow,” she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the student support, external groups such as hip-hop duo Rebel Diaz, a Chicago-based group that was on campus Wednesday to </span><a href=\"https://z-m-www.facebook.com/events/990558504623313/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at a separate event, marched through campus with the strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that the struggles they’re fighting for are not just about wages but about this idea of an entire system becoming privatized and the outsourcing of jobs and services that should be publicly funded,” said Rodrigo “RodStarz” Venegas, who is half of Rebel Diaz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez emphasized that “we all want the same thing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all want to make sure that we have a job tomorrow,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall gave planning services company KTUA  — which provides analysis and improves landscapes and transportation systems — an opportunity to share its concepts for redesigned UCSB transport, which will be implemented in the coming years to accommodate several new campus buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite a call for student voices to be involved in the new design, only six UCSB students attended the town hall when “we would have liked two hundred,” Tom Bertulis, a senior transportation engineer with KTUA, lamented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member spoke out about the lack of student voices at the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You think that students have the time to come to a two-hour meeting? Students are very busy, and that’s why they can’t come. If you need them to answer these questions, maybe email them,” he half-jokingly told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertulis began his presentation, he touched upon UCSB’s recent platinum-level bike friendliness designation, noting that UCSB is one of eight colleges in the nation to receive it and emphasizing the campus’s “unique bike culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, there are almost 1,300 bike trips in a peak 15-minute period. I’ve never seen anything like this… there are definitely unique challenges this campus faces in regards to bikes. Even a freeway can’t handle that many cars in such a short period,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alissa Hummer, director of Campus Planning and Design, explained the campus expansion that the renovated transit plans are meant to address, which include the construction of a new lecture hall that will begin within the next one and a half years, with 540 new faculty residences and a new student housing project in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we need to not have people bike on the interior of campus and just put bike racks on the outside?” Hummer asked. “It’s something to consider. At this point, everything is on the table.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new lecture hall, which is being built to accommodate increased class sizes, will most likely divert bike traffic onto UCen Road, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students understand the constraints of building a new lecture hall, but they understandably have some trepidation. We haven’t yet tried to mix bikes and cars in the same transport lane, but it will only be for about a block,” Hummer said. “In addition, we will most likely need new bike paths coming into the western side of campus to accommodate the new housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence of campus biking is why second-year environmental science major Sophie Roberts, a member of the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, decided to attend the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to maintain the bike paths that we have, and even add new ones because there’s so much bike traffic here already that closing paths could be dangerous,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, I have a class in the Psych Building, and then 10 minutes later I have a class on the other side of campus, and it’s physically impossible for me to get there by walking, which is why it’s so important to me we keep the bike paths.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Samarin, a KTUA consultant, emphasized wanting to clear up misconceptions students might have about the remodelling and removal of various bike paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The university has proposed some things, which are at this point just proposals. We’re here today to listen to feedback and see how people feel,” Samarin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In regards to closing bike paths, that would be for paths that are underused. We might be able to repurpose those for shuttles. It’s not removing paths just to remove them, it would be to accommodate other mobility,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertulis also brought up the idea of autonomous campus shuttles known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles, which are futuristic-looking white shuttles that could hypothetically transport students to opposite ends of campus and provide an alternative mode of transport for students who have trouble walking across campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was speaking to someone who represents the disabled population on campus and currently we have Uber and Lyft reimbursement for students who need a shuttle type of service. But we’re looking at more regular type of shuttle that could come more regularly and serve a larger demographic, if there’s demand,” Samarin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making campus transportation more accessible for disabled individuals was a key point throughout the moderated conversation at the town hall. Currently, making sure handicapped individuals have the transport services they need is one of KTUA’s “number one priorities,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the town hall, Hummer ended her conversation with a question for students and staff alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really have to look at this bike system that was never formally designed but was put together piece by piece by piece. We need to look at how it’s circulating. Are the bones of this system good and just need some tweaking, or is it fundamentally broken and we need to retool it all together?”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
