Managers are planning to house several more this year. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A new count and survey shows a slight increase in the number of homeless in Isla Vista from last year but a decrease of nearly 50 percent since 2013.</p>\n<p>The survey by the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness (C3H) was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Pescadero Lofts, a nearly $10 million complex that opened in 2014 to bring 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the streets.</p>\n<p>Volunteers, many of whom were UC Santa Barbara students, counted 19 homeless people in I.V. this April using a smartphone app to determine their “vulnerability score” based on questions about income, health, substance abuse and duration of homelessness.</p>\n<p>This year’s count is up slightly from 13 in January 2015 — a month after the lofts opened — but is a significant decrease from 34 in 2013.</p>\n<p>One reason the number of homeless may have increased from last year is that all of the previous year’s surveys (2011, 2013, 2015) were conducted in January when it is colder, while this year’s survey took place in April.</p>\n<p>The most recent survey, however, was conducted over a smaller area than in past years, spanning from UCSB to the Devereux Lagoon and from El Colegio Road to the beach, omitting the Ellwood area in Goleta for the first time.</p>\n<p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, volunteers were instructed to approach people they believed were homeless, report the person’s current location and ask where they had slept the previous night. People who said they slept outside of I.V. were not counted in the survey.</p>\n<p>“For us to really be able to help people, we need to know who they are, where they are and what they need,” said Luke Barrett, the regional coordinator for C3H in South Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>C3H will select up to 10 of I.V.’s most vulnerable homeless and move them into permanent housing, either in the Pescadero Lofts or at other locations such as Friendship Manor or veteran housing.</p>\n<p>Chuck Flacks, executive editor of C3H, said I.V. poses unique obstacles to organizations helping the homeless because some people come to I.V. with little more than the clothes on their back.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has historically been a community of openness — almost an experimental community,” Flacks said. “Since the ‘60s and before, I.V. was a kind of utopian place. There are plenty of people who kind of come to Isla Vista to just be in this utopian environment.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Ferraez, on-site resident manager for the Pescadero Lofts, said that I.V. has a “unique chronic homeless population,” noting that I.V. is 15 miles from the nearest shelter despite the fact that I.V.’s homeless are more likely to have mental health issues than those in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There are people living [in the lofts] or on the waiting list who truly don’t want to live downtown and don’t feel supported downtown,” Ferraez said. “They are isolated from all supportive services besides the I.V. Clinic.”</p>\n<p>Ferraez said there is an “overrepresentation of chronic alcoholism” in I.V.’s homeless population, something she said may be due to the “high accessibility of alcohol in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The smartphone survey allows C3H to help I.V.’s unique homeless population by quantifying the vulnerability of each homeless person in I.V. Barrett said this “evidence-based” approach gives the homeless “leverage against the system and the bureaucratic nightmare of low-income housing.”</p>\n<p>Many of the initial 35 people placed in the lofts in 2014 were chronic drug users, Barrett said, and are now doing “tremendously better.” He attributes this to the housing itself, but also the access to food, social care, health care and mental health services that the lofts provide.</p>\n<p>Barrett said the fact that the homeless population is still far below its 2013 level is evidence against the idea that if you build services like the Pescadero Lofts, homeless people will come to the area. However, Barrett said there is still much to be done to make sure all homeless people in I.V. have access to the services they need.</p>\n<p>“We know there are some people out there for sure and we have got to figure out how to help them,” Barrett said. “We need to know their names, to know what they look like, to know their needs.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kaitlyn Tang contributed reporting</em></strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

There was also debate of other local issues, particularly concerning I.V., such as discussion of ongoing maintenance and restoration efforts at Anisq’Oyo’ Park, updates on the current fence project initiated by the Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs and plans to potentially implement laws requiring all dogs in I.V. to be leashed.</p>\n<p>In regards to issues of street lighting, Soutar said civic groups have been seeking adequate funding to install more street lamps in the local community. According to Soutar, there is statistical evidence that additional lighting is necessary since much of I.V.’s crime is concentrated in more poorly lit areas.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get $100,000 to do lighting in Isla Vista, and this is going to be going before the Board of Supervisors,” Soutar said. “They did some crime statistics … between El Nido, Pasado, Del Playa, all the way to Camino Corto is the bulk of, you know, where the crime happens.”</p>\n<p>Although installation of new street lamps across Isla Vista would cost approximately $300,000, attaining this initial $100,000 grant would at least allow groups to install of lamps in the most crime-ridden portions of the community.</p>\n<p>In another attempt to make Isla Vista safer, IVRPD met with county officials at Walter Capps Park to receive final approval for the Associated Students EVPLA fence project.</p>\n<p>The Board also discussed progress on Anisq’Oyo’ Park’s pond maintenance and restoration, announcing that rebuilding plans for the park’s stage have been approved by the Planning and Development Department of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>General Manager of IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the park recently received flowers as a donation from Santa Barbara Water Garden.</p>\n<p>“[They] donated about one hundred water hyacinths, which are now split between the front and the back pond,” Gould said. “What those will do, they’ll help filter out a lot of the muck that’s in the water.”</p>\n<p>Lotusland also contributed to the pond’s restoration by donating 50 to 100 plants for growth in the enclosure, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Gould suggested the district of Isla Vista adopt a series of leash laws, similar to those of Santa Barbara County, in order to waive the district’s liability for off-leash dog attacks. Gould said until I.V. implements these policies, it will continue to be responsible for these incidents.</p>\n<p>“In the County of Santa Barbara, all of their parks have leash laws. They post a leash-free zone, and that sort of protects them a little bit,” Gould said. “In the meantime, we don’t have any protections. We don’t have leash laws in any of our parks.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD meetings are open to the public and held on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

id=\"caption-attachment-69457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara’s district attorney, is founder and chair of the Isla Vista Safe Committee. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Dudley proposed two ideas Tuesday that would change Isla Vista’s judicial process: A prosecutor who would have an office in Isla Vista and exclusively try crimes committed in I.V., and a neighborhood court that would bring “restorative justice” to the area.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to workshops around campus like the Green Dot bystander intervention program, the report said UCSB </span>also employs a UCPD<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officer whose purpose is to investigate sexual assaults using a “trauma-informed approach when working with survivors,” funded via a three-year grant from the Federal Office on Violence Against Women.</span></p>\n<p>The report welcomed the decreasing attendance and crime during party weekends such as Halloween and Deltopia, saying a combination of deterrents and on-campus events contributed to the decline.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“While clearly we’ve made a lot of progress, the work’s not done.” – Doreen Farr.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB sends letters to officials of other universities whose students are arrested in I.V. during Deltopia or Halloween weekends, and Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students who are arrested during these party weekends are required to meet with an SBCC dean.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thousands of students attended Fitz and the Tantrums and Snoop Dogg concerts during Halloween weekend last year, which the report says UCSB spent more than $300,000 to host. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grouplove played in UCSB’s Thunderdome on Saturday during Deltopia, drawing an estimated 3,500 students, roughly the same number who attended the unsanctioned festivities in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us agree, to feel that we have confidence in a real culture change and in the improved safety of the community, we would like to see the Halloween and Deltopia events down to the level that they were this past year for a couple more years,” Farr said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69456\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img

are supported in the community,” said Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a UCSB alumnus who focuses on issues affecting I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pragin noted that although arrests and citations declined this year, the numbers increased as a percentage of those who attended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Adams, chair of the board and fourth district supervisor, said the people who attended Deltopia 2016 must have been the ones who were causing problems in past years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though you had less people attending, those are the people that were the problem in the first place,” Adams said, adding that those people will not learn to “conduct themselves in an adult fashion” until they “get arrested a few more times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe they’ll learn their lesson at some point, I know I did,” Adams said. “I just think that this number will go down if we keep chipping away at that culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Freeman, an Isla Vista resident running for third district supervisor, was very critical of the report, and said I.V. Safe acts as if Isla Vista is “a dangerous infestation” and “a problem to be solved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman unfurled large posters of what he said were previous advertising campaigns by I.V. Safe. He said the committee “truly crossed a line” when it ran a picture of inside a medical tent with the caption, “Throwback Thursday to people having a blast at Deltopia last year.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The message of I.V. Safe is one of a totalitarian police state trying to scare people into compliance,” Freeman said, adding that the group’s “rebranding” commercial “comes off as a campaign advertisement for a handful of politicians.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69454\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69454\" data-attachment-id=\"69454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/isla-vista-crime-down-25-over-two-years-da-reports/board-of-supervisors-meeting-4-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Board of Supervisors Meeting 4-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69454\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf disagreed, saying the advertisement campaign might help others realize that there are consequences to drinking heavily in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pictures of the kids in the tent who were getting medical treatment, it was horrible to me,” Wolf said. “It just kind of struck home to me that this could happen.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board members were very supportive of the campaign, thanking the report’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributors extensively, and were hopeful for what they see as an improved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal said I.V.
