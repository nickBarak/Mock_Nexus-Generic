Although Porter makes the </span><a href=\"https://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claim</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he will “ban fracking in the county,” this point is moot. The rock formations in Santa Barbara County require cyclic steam injection to extract oil, which unlike fracking, necessitates the injection of superheated steam rather than chemicals to extract oil. Therefore</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, banning fracking in this County would have little impact on oil production. Additionally, Porter </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/01/22/voter-suppression-charges-roil-supervisorial-race/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that local oil production will cut carbon emissions, but 80% of known fossil fuel reserves </span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WG_p247Kq3lOKHgDJOw117D7Luol5g3n/view\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must be kept in the ground</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to avoid worsening the climate crisis.

Bob Nelson, a candidate for the Fourth District seat on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and former chief of staff for the current Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam, </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has also received funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from oil interests. This district includes Orcutt, Lompoc, a southern segment of Santa Maria and part of the Los Alamos Valley. Currently running unopposed, Nelson has also been </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Porter’s benefactors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In turn, Porter for 2020 has </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributed money and lawn signs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Nelson’s campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though he has received comparatively less contributions than Porter, Nelson has also received funding from multiple smaller, local oil figureheads. Most of </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come from real estate or housing development LLCs but many of these have ties to the oil industry. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Los-Angeles/burton-mesa-holdings-llc/67194667.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burton Mesa Holdings, LLC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has contributed $5000 to Nelson’s campaign, is led by Kenneth Hunter, who is also the president of </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0703841D:US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaquero Energy Inc.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a local oil and gas company. Kenai Drilling, another donor to Nelson’s 2020 campaign, is a local drilling company based locally in Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The company is owned by Tim Crist, who donated to Nelson’s campaign in his own name. Kenai is one of the</span><a href=\"http://www.kenaidrilling.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> largest drilling contractors in the state of California</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rigs available to conduct oil, gas and geothermal drilling on land as well as offshore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 3 we have a choice: to vote for a candidate whose policies are inextricable from the interests of the oil companies or vote for a Board of Supervisors that will stand up to Big Oil. Regardless of political orientation or party membership, a candidate’s funding says a lot about their values and so these facts matter. Afterall, climate change is a bipartisan issue and will affect us all. Here in </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are already experiencing the effects of the climate crisis.

To examine the limitations of the First Amendment, inspecting the concept of freedom of speech is a good place to start. The First Amendment does not allow individuals to say whatever they want, whenever they want. The classic example that is often taught in high school settings is the metaphor of “shouting fire in a crowded theater.” Originating from the 1919 Supreme Court case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schenck v. United States</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “clear and present danger” test prohibits the </span><a href=\"https://lawshelf.com/videos/entry/freedom-of-speech-exceptions-categories-of-speech-not-protected\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incitement of “imminent lawless action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” Additionally, there are </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight other</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> types of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, including obscenity, solicitations to commit crimes, blackmail, true threats, perjury, child pornography, fighting words and defamation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the First Amendment does prevent Congress from limiting one’s freedom of speech, it doesn’t guarantee freedom from consequences — especially from private entities. In the ever-growing age of social media, employers can easily monitor an employee’s behavior off the clock. There have been </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">numerous instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of employees being fired for tweets or public comments they have made. In 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16110696/firing-google-ceo-employee-penned-controversial-memo-on-women-has-violated-its-code-of-conduct\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google fired an employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made a controversial memo that claimed “women had biological issues that prevented them from being as successful as men in tech.” This event demonstrates how the First Amendment’s freedom of speech does not protect citizens from the consequences of expressing their views. </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lata Nott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the executive director of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, makes the point that “it’s the company’s right to discipline their employees’ speech.” This right only applies to private companies, such as in the Google case above. While it may seem like firing an employee over their views infringes on their freedom of speech, the First Amendment has no jurisdiction here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the concept of freedom under the First Amendment may sound universally appealing, its power has been misconstrued, used to discriminate and infringe on the rights of others. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the First Amendment does not protect against being banned on a social media platform. In 2018, Alex Jones, host of the infamous InfoWars, had </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645352618/twitter-bans-alex-jones-and-infowars-cites-abusive-behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his Twitter account permanently suspended</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This led to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, that tech companies were attempting to suppress conservatives online. Despite Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yelling that the United States has freedom of speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment does not protect against this type of action by private companies. The First Amendment prohibits censorship by the government </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— but</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not by private organizations. To be clear, I am not arguing about the ethics of censorship; I am making the argument that these companies have a right to bar and add consequences to certain speech. Proclaiming that such actions violate the First Amendment and one’s freedom of speech are inaccurate statements that misconstrue the actual meaning of the amendment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect of the First Amendment is the freedom of religion. The amendment states that the government cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/your-right-religious-freedom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Civil Liberties Union</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment prevents the government from establishing or promoting religion in any way and gives individuals the right to worship or not worship as they choose, without punishment. Although this clause in the First Amendment is important, its intent and actual protections have been misconstrued. Religious freedom does not protect one from infringing on others’ rights. Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place. Prior to the civil rights era, racial segregationists justified their actions through scripture and religion. Segregationists argued that black people were inferior to white people, referring to their interpretations of the Bible. This appropriation of the Bible thus legally allowed segregationists to claim that hiring black people would violate their religious beliefs. These legal arguments based on religion would not hold today; however, back then, there were no legal protections for marginalized groups. With the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is now official legal framework that denies discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In more recent events, the First Amendment’s assurance of religious freedom has been misconstrued by individuals to justify discrimination against marginalized groups; these actions often go against different pieces of federal legislation, turning the words “religious freedom” into a buzzword. For example, in 2015, Kim Davis garnered national notoriety for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even after the legalization of gay marriage through </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obergefell v. Hodges</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite the legalization, Davis refused to comply and claimed her right to religious freedom by saying that she made the decision “</span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/01/436557085/despite-high-court-ruling-kentucky-clerk-denies-gay-marriage-licences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under God’s authority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This claim is not only misrepresentative of what religious freedom actually is but also uses the buzzword to discriminate. After Davis was forced by the court to issue marriage licenses, she still refused and later was held in </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/us/when-businesses-can-deny-you-service-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contempt of court</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Religion is not an inherently discriminatory idea; however, the usage of religious freedom to masquerade discriminatory practices is a misinterpretation of the First Amendment’s religious protections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the First Amendment being a part of one of the most well-known pieces of American legislation, its actual meaning and applicable situations have been misconstrued and used as a guise to discriminate. The next time an individual proclaims that they have the religious freedom to discriminate against certain patrons or argues that their free speech is being violated when they are banned from a social media platform, double check if they are actually protected under the First Amendment or if they are just throwing around a buzzword.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Tran has the freedom of speech to correct others on their actual First Amendment protections.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Zachary Terwilliger</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the U.S. attorney serving as supervisor of the prosecution, the espionage charges are rooted in Assange’s “alleged complicity in illegal acts to obtain or receive voluminous databases of classified information.” He explained, “The United States has not charged Assange for passively obtaining or receiving classified information.” While this may seem innocuous, “complicity” as used here refers to the willfully illegal solicitation and distribution of classified information. This use of “complicity” effectively criminalizes investigative journalists for investigating national security issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prosecution intends to use the first charge  — conspiracy to receive national defense information — to evade this criticism. If this charge sticks, it will open the door for conviction on the other 16.

The Trump administration has apparently drawn this line and decided to call it conspiracy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To argue that seeking out relevant classified documents constitutes conspiratorial espionage would violate the First Amendment. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspiracy is </span><a href=\"https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=310\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when people work together by agreement to commit an illegal act.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thus, the prosecution must argue for the illegality of </span><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/julian-assange-chelsea-manning-intertwined/story?id=62344376\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assange’s interactions with Chelsea Manning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while maintaining the legality of traditional journalist-whistleblower relationships. The crux of the case is Assange and WikiLeaks’ public and private solicitation of classified material. The idea is that this solicitation encouraged Manning to illegally disclose material, making both culpable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crucially, the prosecution fails to provide a clear definition of solicitation. Might a page on a news organization’s site dedicated to whistleblowers, like that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/tips\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or</span><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/source/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Intercept</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be considered solicitation? One of the references the prosecutors cite is</span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091104212937/http:/wikileaks.org/wiki/Draft:The_Most_Wanted_Leaks_of_2009\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WikiLeaks’ “Most Wanted Leaks of 2009”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> list, an open-source document which lists specific files of interest. Some of these files are classified. The prosecutors might then consider criminal solicitation to include the listing of specific classified documents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this is still concerning. Suppose there was reason to suspect illicit activity in a government program. The responsibility of a free press is to seek out this material. Publishers do, and should, solicit and publish material of interest, whether it is classified or not. To argue that seeking out relevant classified documents constitutes conspiratorial espionage would violate the First Amendment. </span></p>\n<p>Beyond public solicitation, the prosecutors cite private communications between Assange and Manning where Assange expressed interest in further leaks. By emphasizing his awareness that Manning’s sharing was illegal, the prosecutors intend to indicate his complicity. However, calling this conspiratorial solicitation is problematic for the same reasons as above. The press isn’t legally obligated to respect a document’s confidentiality, particularly when the document concerns the public interest. Sometimes, confidentiality is appropriate and the content shouldn’t be communicated. Other times, there might be a moral obligation to do the opposite. In this instance, one of the things Assange and Manning communicated to the public was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1582304895038000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhnQCGIut-Ryya9Zg670L_Co-54A\">15,000 unreported civilian deaths in Iraq</a>. Perhaps in exposing such information, Assange and Manning were fulfilling an important social function as journalist and whistleblower.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This use of “complicity” effectively criminalizes investigative journalists for investigating national security issues.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WikiLeaks’ solicitation only differs from that of other media organizations by its degree. Criminalizing its actions criminalizes constitutionally protected speech and endangers other publishers, as they operate within the same category. If the prosecution fails to convict Assange on the conspiracy charge, they cannot convict him on the obtaining and disclosing charges either. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may reject my arguments here by stating that Assange isn’t a journalist or politically neutral. This is a good point because the First Amendment only applies to impartial, licensed journalists. John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/1131663755161591808/photo/1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">elaborates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “Julian Assange is no journalist. This is made plain by the totality of his conduct as alleged in the indictment. His conspiring with and assisting a security clearance holder to acquire classified information, and his publishing the names of human sources.” With “conspiring” understood as solicitation and “assisting a security clearance holder” understood as attempting to support someone who is concerned for her own safety, the reference to Assange’s lack of redaction does raise an important issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">In publishing some of the Iraq and Afghanistan War documents, Assange’s transparency led to the release of the names of civilian informants, endangering them to possible retribution.

While these two candidates may seem one and the same, certain defining values play an important role in distinguishing between them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upholds the ideals of a democratic socialist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while Warren </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-vows-to-remake-capitalism-businesses-are-bracing-11570643931\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands by capitalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a well-regulated economy. Sanders defends the notion that the current economic structure is “rigged” and must be abolished completely in order to establish a government that reinvents justice. Senator Warren embraces policies of change to the current system, and offers a remedy in her economic patriotism agenda. She pledges a commitment to fundamentally change the government’s approach to the economy, by placing American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of large corporations and Wall Street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As exhibited by their policies, Sanders and Warren represent two vastly different approaches to changing the injustices present in the American system of government. The leftist stance that Sanders presents is founded on the notion that the United States must abolish the system that enables economic disparities, while Warren seeks to reform the system from the inside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One issue that is at the forefront of this election is the student debt crisis affecting 44.7 million Americans, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/student-loan-statistics-2019-n997836\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $1.5 trillion dollars of student debt in the United States is an issue that the Democratic party pledges to eradicate. However, Senators Sanders and Warren offer varying remedies that demonstrate the divisions between their idealistic and realistic approaches, respectively.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Sanders </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/24/bernie-sanders-student-loan-debt-proposal/1544864001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to relieve all student debt by raising money through a Wall Street tax that would add fees to the sale and trade of bonds and stocks. This ambitious effort benefits people of all classes, but asks the government to raise vast amounts of money through means of taxation. This unrealistic plan fails to earn enough revenue to support this initiative, and stands to affect middle class workers. While the tax is aimed at Wall Street investor offices, the debt would fall upon investors themselves when making a transaction. This would discourage trading and hinder the capitalist opportunities that this country is powered by. Senator Sanders proposes high aspirations that in theory would help shape the country. However, these methods of funding fail to meet the demands his programs call for. A sensible candidate such as Warren recognizes the practical approach that must be taken in order to enact real change in the government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Warren, on the other hand, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/elizabeth-warrens-student-debt-bill-would-help-45-million-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presents an initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to focus on students who come from lower income households. Her plan proposes to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for every individual with an income under $100,000. For those with an annual income between $100,000 and $250,000, she promises substantial debt reduction. Warren plans to fund her program with a “wealth tax,” which levies a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, and a 3% tax on individuals who have more than $50 million. Her objective allows for a more affordable plan than the one Senator Sanders advocates for. The Vermont senator’s bill would </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost the government $2.2 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the course of 10 years, while Warren’s would only </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/06/27/how-do-warrens-and-sanders-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-compare/#4a1150de18c4%5D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost $1.25 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the same timespan. This approach to the higher education crisis in the United States demonstrates the dream-like idealism characterizing Senator Sanders’ policies. Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren not only seeks a more practical approach to politics, but she has demonstrated with her extensive track record the effort it takes to successfully implement one’s policies in a bipartisan government. A good indicator of a politician’s potential for presidential success is their </span><a href=\"https://qz.com/1560188/what-the-2020-democratic-candidates-did-in-congress/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ability to pass bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while serving in the House or Senate. During the 2017-2019 congressional terms, when both the House and Senate were controlled by the Republican party for a year, Warren introduced five bills that passed in both houses. Senator Sanders was unable to pass any bills. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren embodies a candidate that can decisively enact her policy reforms and bring about change to the political system. She </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands by</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> abolishing capital punishment and private prisons; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour; free college education and Medicare For All. She is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/31/warrens-agenda-break-up-monopolies-give-workers-control-over-corporations-fight-big-pharma/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">committed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to investigating large corporations and their leaders, and taxing the wealthy to support welfare programs for all.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. Issues in governmental law cannot be solved by just one bill or proposal of change. In order to eradicate the major crises affecting the country today, the United States needs a leader with a clear head who possesses the ability to negotiate with the opposition. Radicalism only goes so far as its opponents will allow, and with a Republican majority still existing in the Senate, it is difficult for mass reform movements to mobilize. Slow and steady wins the race, and Senator Warren plans to enact reform through the strategy of cooperation in order to avoid facing large roadblocks that will result in political gridlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both politicians are leaders of progressive reform; however, Warren has not embraced Democratic socialism to the extent that Senator Sanders has. She promises to stand for compromise and uphold the values of a free market in the United States. It is time for a woman to fulfill the role of the President of the United States and carry her message to the White House.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Rubin strongly advocates the election of Elizabeth Warren to the White House. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BC6701CC-F449-4582-8D3F-5D62CB407529-Sara-Rubin.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sara Rubin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sara Rubin is an Opinion staff writer and Political Science major.
