The Thunder needed every bit of his contribution against the Spurs, and with Reggie Jackson unlikely to match Westbrook’s production level on both ends of the floor, it looks unlikely OKC will return to the finals if it faces off against San Antonio.</p>\n<p>At this point in the postseason, San Antonio seems like the favorite to represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals not because they are the best team, but because they are the healthiest at this point in the season.</p>\n<p>That seemed like an unlikely statement only weeks ago. It goes to show just how unpredictable the NBA postseason can be.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/","id":3190,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3189,3188,3187],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Hits and Misses of the 2013 NFL Draft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After last year’s draft featured three or four franchise-changing quarterbacks, the top of the 2013 draft was quite the opposite.

Instead of a selecting big time playmakers, the Chiefs and Jaguars selected offensive tackles Eric Fisher and Luke Joeckel with the first two overall picks.</p>\n<p>This draft marks the first time since 2008 that an offensive tackle was taken first overall, and the first time since 1970 that offensive tackles were taken with the first two picks. The madness didn’t stop there either. Out of the 32 picks in the first round, 18 were spent on either an offensive or defensive lineman. To top it all off, this draft was the first time a running back wasn’t taken in the first round since 1963.</p>\n<p>All of that was semi-expected. What was not foreseen was the Bills selection of Florida St. quarterback E.J. Manuel with the 16th overall pick. Many experts had West Virginia’s Geno Smith as the top rated quarterback, but the Bills and first year Head Coach Doug Marrone decided to go with Manuel. Marrone is coming to the Bills via Syracuse, where Ryan Nassib was his quarterback. There was a lot of speculation that the Bills would select Nassib and keep him with his college coach. However, the Bills ultimately decided to trade down from their original spot at number eight overall to 16th overall and select Manuel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Those were some of the top story lines from the first round; here is a look at some of the draft classes for individual teams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Francisco 49ers:</p>\n<p>The 49ers did not have any glaring needs heading into the draft. During the offseason, defensive tackle Isaac Sopoaga signed with the Eagles and safety Dashon Goldson signed with the Buccaneers. However, before the draft, the Niners added depth at those positions by signing safety Craig Dahl and former fifth overall pick and defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey. These replacements aren’t on the same level but they are certainly capable players.</p>\n<p>With their first three picks in the draft, the Niners went with safety Matt Elam, defensive end Cornellius “Tank” Carradine, and tight end Vance McDonald. Elam is coming out of the University of Florida where he proved he can impact the game with his coverage and tackling skills. McDonald fills the void left by back up tight end Delanie Walker’s departure. In the fourth round, the Niners selected South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore. Lattimore was a perennial preseason Heisman candidate before tearing his ACL and dislocating his knee cap in consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Diego Chargers:</p>\n<p>The Chargers are in an awkward place as a team right now. Five or six years ago, the Chargers were one of the most talented teams in the league. Now it seems as though the rest of the league has gotten better, while the Chargers have let their roster wither. Now with a new general manager in Tom Telesco and first year Head Coach Mike McCoy at the reins, the Chargers are headed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Entering the draft, the Chargers had obvious needs on the offensive line and at the wide receiver position. With their first three picks, San Diego took Alabama offensive tackle D.J. Fluker, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o and Cal wide receiver Keenan Allen. The Chargers really nailed it with these picks. Fluker will start right away and will probably develop into a solid left tackle. Te’o was a projected first rounder but fell all the way to the Chargers at 38th overall. Look for all three of these picks to contribute right away in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Green Bay Packers:</p>\n<p>The Packers need to protect Aaron Rodgers, develop a better running game and shore up their aging defense. So what did they do? Drafted a beast of a defensive end from UCLA in Datone Jones, selected two offensive linemen and locked up two of the best running backs in the draft with Alabama’s Eddie Lacy and UCLA’s Johnathan Franklin. With these players and their other draft selections, the Packers did a beautiful job at filling the team’s needs. However, Green Bay does need to find an answer to the departures of defensive back Charles Woodson and wide receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings:</p>\n<p>The Vikings made the most out of their three first round picks. The Vikings needed help on defense and at the wide receiver position after the departure of wide receiver Percy Harvin. At 23rd overall, they drafted an absolute stud in defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd, who many projected to be a top-10 selection. Then they grabbed cornerback Xavier Rhodes out of Florida St. Rhodes is a physical player, who also possesses good ball skills. At 29th overall, Minnesota filled Harvin’s spot with Tennessee wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson. Patterson is 6’2”, 216 pounds and can jump out of stadium; however, he did only play one year of big time college football after transferring from the junior college ranks. Nonetheless, the Vikings are a much better team now with Patterson lining up with new acquisition Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles:</p>\n<p>After a few years of controversy and rumors, the Eagles finally parted ways with Head Coach Andy Reid after fourteen seasons. Now the man calling the shots is former Oregon Head Coach Chip Kelly. Kelly is thought of around football as an offensive genius who is going to try to bring his patented style of lightning quick offense to the NFL.</p>\n<p>With the fourth overall pick, the Eagles went with Oklahoma offensive tackle Lane Johnson. Johnson makes sense because he played in a similar quick tempo offense in college. Johnson is a freak athlete who converted to tackle after playing quarterback in high school. Philadelphia then went on to take Stanford tight end Zach Ertz who can do a lot of things on the offensive side of the ball. He is a tough, versatile athlete who will fit into Kelly’s offense nicely.</p>\n<p>With the first pick in the fourth round, the Eagles shocked a lot of people by drafting USC quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley’s stock plummeted in his final year of college after he would have likely been a top-10 pick in the 2012 draft. Barkley’s arrival brings a lot of attention to the QB situation in Philadelphia. Is Michael Vick the right fit for Kelly’s spread offense? Or it could be either Nick Foles or Barkley, who are more pocket passers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders:</p>\n<p>The first five teams that I mentioned all had great drafts. The Oakland Raiders, unfortunately, did not. While the Raiders’ woeful roster management should come as no surprise, they just continue to baffle me.</p>\n<p>The Raiders ended up taking D.J. Hayden, a cornerback out of Houston, with the 12th overall pick. Hayden is a great story because he almost lost his life in college after a knee to the chest caused immense internal bleeding. But if you are the Raiders and you want to take a cornerback, how about just staying at the third overall pick and select Alabama’s Dee Milliner? Milliner is a player you can build your defense around, but instead the Raiders traded down to gamble on a player who may never play a down of professional football.</p>\n<p>So, with the 2013 NFL draft in the books we can all look forward to the Ravens-Broncos game on opening night, another New York Jets quarterback controversy and another year of Tony Romo playing quarterback for the Cowboys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1624917340\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51102\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51103\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/eric-fisher/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"486,560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Fisher\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=217%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51103\" alt=\"Eric Fisher\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher-216x250.jpg?resize=216%2C250\" width=\"216\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Anna Xu of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51102\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51102\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/","id":3187,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3186,3185,3184],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Breaking: Judicial Council Unanimously Votes To Remove A.S.

Former Campus United party chair Katie Mukai then filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition</a> against Salari on Jan. 29, arguing that Salari should be removed from her position.</p>\n<p>The council <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/judicial-council-hears-salari-trial/\">heard arguments</a> in <em>Katie Mukai</em> v. <em>Yasamin Salari</em> on Feb. 20, with Mukai named as the petitioner and Salari as the respondent.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Judicial-Council-Opinion-On-Mukai-v.-Salari.pdf\">opinion</a> rules in favor of Mukai.</p>\n<p>“The Respondent’s place of residence constitutes a breach of the Associated Students Legal Code,” the council wrote in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“The Judicial Council determines that the Respondent is not eligible for the position of On­-Campus Senator and finds that the Respondent cannot continue in office as On­-Campus Senator in the 69th Senate.”</p>\n<p>As stated in Associated Students (A.S.) By-­Laws Article III §1(B)(4), seen on page 21 of the most recent version of the legal code, all Senators are required to live amongst their constituents during the fall, winter and spring quarters of their terms.</p>\n<p>Salari’s representation during her trial – former Off-Campus Senator for the 68th Senate Alexandra Gessesse – argued that Salari’s living arrangement did not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents.</p>\n<p>However, the council found that Salari’s “quality of work as a Senator did not pertain to the question of eligibility.”</p>\n<p>Following Salari’s initial admission, the A.S. Senate granted her a one-time exception. During the trial, Gessesse pointed to incidents in the past when Senates granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituencies.</p>\n<p>However, the council invalidated Senate’s ability to do so in Tuesday’s opinion, stating that while Senate has the power to make changes to legal code, they “are not allowed to circumvent the breach of legal code through special exceptions.”</p>\n<p>“The Legal Code of the Associated Students is the foremost authority on Associated Students rules and regulations and cannot be superseded by Senate motions and resolutions,” the council wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>“The Students of UCSB are entitled to representation by individuals living among them. Allowing a one-­time exception to the eligibility requirements for these representative positions undermines this principle and is harmful towards the constituents’ needs.”</p>\n<p>Salari will be allowed to keep her Fall Quarter 2018 honoraria, and can apply for her Winter Quarter 2019 honoraria.</p>\n<p>The next runner up to take her place is second-year history of public policy major Eric Moon, according to Spring Quarter 2018 Election results.</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time if or when Salari’s seat will be filled. The individual to take her place will only serve for a little more than two months before the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-86522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several administrations spoke at the town hall, including VP for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn (right). <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), an extension of the Associated Students (A.S.) Human Rights Board, <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">revised its list of Asks</a> on Feb. 4 to include mandatory training for Office of Student Life organizations and sports teams, a revised Title IX Office website and online access to Gaucho FYI content, among other requests.</p>\n<p>Monday’s town hall was the second of the year, following the first <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-26/sasa-hosts-town-hall-focuses-on-interpersonal-violence-prevention/\">town hall</a> that was held at the Pardall Center in November.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez led the meeting alongside SASA Vice Director Alya Ruiz and SASA Policy Analysts Vince Feliciano and Alia Reynolds.</p>\n<p>Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez began by providing an update on the Department of Education’s <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">Proposed Title IX Amendments</a>. The department is still in the process of reviewing comments, which means that the status of the amendments is still unclear, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>The most concerning potential regulations include changes to the evidence threshold, scope of jurisdiction and responsible employee designation, according to Alvarez. Additional amendments include the right to cross-examination of survivors and perpetrators and a narrowing of the definition of sexual assault under Title IX.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Briana Conway said to students that despite the potential stress the proposed changes could bring survivors, C.A.R.E. will work to support them through the legal process however it can.</p>\n<p>Reynolds pointed to <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB493\">Senate Bill 493</a>, a piece of legislation recently introduced by Senator Hannah Beth Hannah-Beth Jackson, which aims to combat potential issues arising from the amendments.</p>\n<p>Reynolds questioned whether the UCSB administration would be taking a stance on the legislation. The UC system <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">released a response</a> to the proposed amendments in December 2018, stating that the changes would “reverse decades of well-established, hard-won progress toward equity.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez responded that they are aware of the bill and are currently trying to navigate its position.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock discussed the possibility of requiring Standard of Excellence Training for OSL organizations and sports teams, which is another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>The Standards of Excellence is an educational program run by C.A.R.E. that is currently required for fraternities and sororities on campus. SASA has requested that the training be required for all OSL organizations and sports teams.</p>\n<p>The current obstacles for Standards of Excellence training concerns the content of the curriculum, which is still under discussion, Ashlock said. OSL plans to meet with C.A.R.E. to review the Standards of Excellence.</p>\n<p>Alvarez gave an update on SASA’s third Ask, which requests a redesigned Public Accountability Report modeled after UCLA’s Title IX Office. UCLA’s model features an “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB currently produces an annual report, SASA feels that shifting to UCLA’s model will provide more thorough information.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Title IX Office is in the process of considering which aspects of UCLA’s model may be beneficial for UCSB, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Students and Director of Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Kimberly Equinoa discussed the online accessibility of Gaucho FYI content, another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>Equinoa predicts that the Gaucho FYI content will be accessible online within the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>SASA officers also discussed the Ask that requests $5,000 annually from UCSB. The funds would be used “to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>Ruiz clarified that funds for this request would ideally come from university fees, not student fees.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn suggested a formal proposal and budget for the ask, detailing what the campaign will accomplish. The SASA officers agreed to follow up on this request.</p>\n<p>SASA officers moved on to discuss the National College Health Assessment, a survey distributed to over 100 universities nationwide that assesses students’ “habits, behaviors, and perceptions,” according to National College Health Assessment website.</p>\n<p>The survey questions students on topics ranging from alcohol and drug use to personal safety and violence. It was distributed to UCSB students via email on Feb. 12.</p>\n<p>Ashlock explained that the survey provides reliable national data, allowing administration to see which issues are unique or less prevalent at UCSB. These trends allow administrators to gauge which programs and policies are beneficial.</p>\n<p>Feliciano voiced several of SASA’s concerns regarding the survey, including its lack of trigger warnings and feedback opportunities. He noted that SASA officers were also disturbed that the survey did not list any resources and neglected to give a clear definition of affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>Conway responded that UCSB did not have any jurisdiction over the content of the survey itself, only the email that was sent to students. The email provided a trigger warning, stating that there may be some “personal discomfort with the content of certain questions.”</p>\n<p>Conway also explained that the Health Equity Initiative, a work group that promotes health equity for underserved students, went through the survey last spring and wrote recommendations to the national organization. The group consists of members from RCSGD, C.A.R.E., C.A.P.S., Student Health, the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, Health &amp; Wellness and the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration requested that the SASA Officers compose their feedback in writing to allow them to seriously acknowledge their concerns.</p>\n<p>SASA’s next town hall will take place in Spring Quarter, with exact date and location yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
