Food Co-op and Santa Barbara Student Housing Co-op, Associated Students and Isla Vista community members.<em> Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Food Bank and UCSB Sustainability hosted their first of two Isla Vista Food Forums discussing student food insecurity at the local and state level at the Santa Barbara Hillel last night.</p>\n<p>During the forum attendees explored student inaccessibility to healthy food, the lack of local governance surrounding healthy eating practices, the increasing costs of education and its impact on student health and the financial issues that accompany eating out versus grocery shopping. The idea for the forum was born from collaboration between the A.S. Food Bank Committee and UC President Janet Napolitano’s UC Global Food Initiative, which aims to establish food security around the world.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze said planning for the forums manifested after the California Higher Education Food Summit, which brought sustainability workshops and renowned sustainable food advocates to campus this past January.</p>\n<p>“Our hope is to continue the conversation surrounding food justice and food security that grew out of the California Higher Education Food Summit, but to bring the discussion back to a more local level that students and I.V. community members can really relate to and be a part of,” Freeze said in an email.</p>\n<p>Freeze said goals for the forum include bringing students, I.V. residents and local organizations together to come up with solutions for the various food security issues that surround students on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Through the forum, we are hoping to create and implement feasible methods for ensuring that all I.V. residents have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food in the future,” Freeze said in an email. “The more voices we can involve, the more successful we will be in achieving this goal.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, food inaccessibility is a problem of increasing severity, with the A.S. Food Bank servicing over 4,000 individuals since opening in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We feel it’s really important for students to be involved in the forum because food insecurity remains largely unacknowledged in our community,” Freeze said in an email. “It is a major problem that is continuing to grow, especially among students.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard said input from the campus community is an important aspect of these forums when discussing methods to improve health and food security on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get feedback from students, staff, and faculty across campus on what we should include in our goals moving forward,” Maynard said in an email. “As a result we will be hosting a series of public forums this quarter and next.”</p>\n<p>General Manager of the Isla Vista Food Co-op Melissa Cohen said the purpose of the forums is to begin uniting various food-centered dialogue  occurring in the I.V. community, including work done by the A.S. Food Bank and in light of the UC Global Food Initiative.</p>\n<p>“The goal is to start to thread together a lot of different conversations that are happening to create one cohesive dialogue and to then be utilized in future conversations,” Cohen said. “The Food Forum will show that there’s a unified dialogue happening between everyone who’s in an invested organization in this conversation.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said the I.V. Food Co-op is a major partner of the A.S. Food Bank and works closely with them on issues surrounding “the food movement” in I.V.<br>\n“The goal is to make sure that everyone who needs to be in this dialogue and who is affected by either food insecurity or are affected by being a part of an organization that has the resources to address that … are talking to each other,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Diane Fox, who ran a food co-op 30 years ago in New Haven, Connecticut, said the forum brought back memories of the struggles she and community members faced in terms of food security and affordability in her own community.</p>\n<p>“This is sort of nostalgic for me because I ran a food co-op, so I’m interested in the issues that people are struggling with because I remember those issues,” Fox said. “I love the energy that people are bringing. It’s made me want to come visit the co-op here.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Environmental Affairs Board member and second year psychology major Yanira Flores said the I.V. Food Forum is a great way to create a dialogue between students and organizations to figure out how to better serve the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really good resource to have because it’s a very good way to start a conversation that’s been pending for a very long time,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>“Although the Environmental Board is mainly environmental, it has to do with every aspect of environmentalism which includes food security and food justice. It’s all incorporated and inter-connected.”</p>\n<p>Flores also said the most important issue I.V. and the university need to work on is educating both students and citizens on food resources available to them.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like a few of the things people were saying they needed are already in place but they just weren’t aware that it was,” Flores said. “So I think information, education and more communication between businesses, between students and between Isla Vista itself [is important].”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, March 5, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/food-security-forum-explores-finances-of-eating-healthy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/food-security-forum-explores-finances-of-eating-healthy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/food-security-forum-explores-finances-of-eating-healthy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/food-security-forum-explores-finances-of-eating-healthy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/food-security-forum-explores-finances-of-eating-healthy/","id":2863,"author":{"id":167,"name":"Erica Loera"},"related":[2862,2861,2860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":167,"name":"Erica Loera","biography":"Not available","articles":[2863,2936,3461,4742,4775],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

SJP President and second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur was the main speaker for the presentation and began the event speaking about the many ways in which Palestine is affected by the occupation and apartheid of the region, as well as the U.S.’s relationship with the conflict.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, the problems in Palestine span a wide range of humanitarian issues that transcend the political motives controlling the region.</p>\n<p>“In regards to Palestine, it connects to women’s issues, queer issues, environmental problems, state violence, immigration and displacement of indigenous populations,” Kaur said. “It goes beyond transnational borders because it is much more than people perceive. It does not just affect one group of people with one issue.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting case of Michael Brown in the U.S. is directly tied to Palestinian oppression because the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) trained some members of the American police force who were active in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“The government in Palestine is super fearful of public opinion and resistance. But the IDF trains the police in the U.S. to have the same fear,” Kaur said. “It is connected to the Ferguson issue because the police here are trained to oppress resistance at all violent costs. It was a case of rampant anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, police brutality leading to the death of innocent people is modeled after “the hatred and strategy of the Israeli army.” Kaur said the strategy stems from the fear of possible opposition, aiming to abuse people from the lower class and encouraging the marginalization of these people in a consistent manner.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental science major Nia Mitchell said her historically marginalized Afro-Cuban culture helps her understand the ongoing oppression in Israel.</p>\n<p>“I identify as Afro-Cuban and I realize that my people are and have been dominated and oppressed,” Mitchell said. “This is what happens in all lands. Therefore, it is so clear for me to see how it is impossible to take away issues like women oppression because of interconnectivity between dominance and exploitation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61431\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61431\" data-attachment-id=\"61431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/occupation_sam-aragon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the interesection of palestine and other human rights issues.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424978633\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Occupation_Sam Aragon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61431\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Occupation_Sam-Aragon-1024x678.jpg?resize=365%2C242\" alt=\"Anumita Kaur facilitates a group discussion on the intersection of Palestine and other human rights issues.

Women have very little rights there and this will unfortunately most likely continue.”</p>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Jeremy Garza said racism exists in different forms in the U.S. and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“All forms of racism are not the same around the world. For example, we see in the Ferguson case that there is discrimination against blacks,” Garza said. “There are also a lot of African immigrants in Israel and they are not given documentation, rights, work, and are only provided with segregation.”</p>\n<p>According to Garza, African women are being sterilized in Israel because the government wants to control the population.</p>\n<p>“These women are not provided with equal rights but are being sterilized which is an example of how the government controls their people,” Garza said. “This is a tactic that the U.S. has used plenty of times in South America and with Native Americans.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Shahryar Mooraj said female immigrants in Gaza must also face sterility checkpoints and are unable to obtain medical assistance such as medicine, ambulances and local doctors.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of unfairness in Palestine, especially with the issue of sterilizing women at checkpoints. Women are being sterilized but do not get to experience medical attention and it is definitely unfair for Palestinians,” Mooraj said. “They do not have access to medical aid in Gaza which is a denial of life. There are no ambulances or speedy recoveries.”</p>\n<p>Mooraj said his immigrant lifestyle in the U.S. is much easier than the life of Palestinian immigrant because he is granted basic civil rights and allowed to travel.</p>\n<p>“I am an international student myself and cannot imagine the troubles that immigrants face in Palestine,” Mooraj said. “The restriction of movement of the Palestinian people is wrong because they have been there for years and are denied public services. I fortunately have not faced such discrimination in the U.S. so far as an immigrant student.”</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, people should be allowed to relocate and travel in their search for suitable living conditions.</p>\n<p>“At the core, this is really a human rights violation because people need to have the right to move around and find comfort,” Mooraj said. “They need to be able to grow and expand. People in Gaza and the West Bank just do not have that and I find it to be completely awful.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61440\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61440\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/humyn-rights-board-students-for-justice-in-palestine-host-talk/","id":2861,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2860,2859,2858],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: Just ‘Cause You Can’t See Them, Doesn’t Mean They Can’t See You","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The death of Lucas Ransom was a blow to the UCSB community and to the nation.

They’re sculpted in the devil’s own image, with massive torpedo-like bodies and gaping jaws. They choose to take a bite out of you, and you’re pretty much done for.</p>\n<p>At first, the feeling creeps up and wraps around you like a constricting vest, and makes you wish you didn’t have any limbs dangling off of your board and into the unseen depths below.</p>\n<p>That feeling is panic. Primal innate terror — your fight or flight mechanism. In the ocean, that crucial inner “oh shit” alarm kicks in when your body suspects the presence of a predator swimming nearby.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it manifests as an eerie tingle or the gut feeling that something is not right. The water becomes hostile and your hackles rise.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry,” you think to yourself. Science suggests that sharks don’t truly appreciate the taste of human flesh, rarely attack humans and will probably spit you out if they happen to bite out of curiosity or hunger.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s a fact you’ve got to accept or quit swimming in the sea. The Pacific Ocean is our backyard. Among other things, it’s a hotspot for great white sharks, among other species — most docile, some dangerous, most just dumb and hungry.</p>\n<p>Big predators are out there — charging through the unknown beneath, free of conscience or notions of guilt. They don’t care for your career aspirations or how much your family loves you and don’t have qualms about taking a bite out of you just to see how you taste. Inside, they sing their blissful song, “Nat-Ur-Al. Sur-Vi-Val!”</p>\n<p>Nobody truly thinks they’re going to be the one. It’s hard to even start pondering, but sometimes you can’t stop yourself.</p>\n<p>We don’t know what’s going to happen out there. There’s no way to say that the next time we go surfing our own lives won’t be placed in jeopardy because of a shark. But, there’s also no way to say that you won’t die in a fiery car crash on your way to the beach one day, or perhaps a heart attack on the shitter when you’re 95.</p>\n<p>I take some comfort in that fact that you can’t blame sharks for what they do. They aren’t monsters, despite their appearance. They are just big scary-ass animals looking for lunch. And I can’t begrudge them that, as much as I fear and grieve their attacks. Universal balancing power resides in a shark’s jaws just as it does within everything in nature.</p>\n<p>To most landlubbers, surfing with the risk of a shark attack hanging on your head seems like an unnecessary risk, but that’s clouded thinking.</p>\n<p>Putting your life on the line builds character. Although I could think of more dangerous activities, surfing does pose significant risks, including marine predators. Engaging yourself in vigorous pursuit of your passions is the staple of a healthy life. While danger may sometimes encroach on that sphere, it’s reflective of a strong personality and an unassuming soul to move forward in the face of danger to accomplish personal goals.</p>\n<p>It’s an internal decision you have to make with yourself and take to the grave, although most of us will be fortunate enough to not have to take that decision to an early grave. And should that happen, you’ll know, in your last moments or beyond, that your life wasn’t taken in vain — that you were taken as part of a grander plan, a force that guides and cycles life.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/nuglets-wisdom-doesnt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/nuglets-wisdom-doesnt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/nuglets-wisdom-doesnt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/nuglets-wisdom-doesnt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/nuglets-wisdom-doesnt/","id":2862,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2861,2860,2859],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
