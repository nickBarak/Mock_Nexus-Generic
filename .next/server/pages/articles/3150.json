Additionally, the council discussed the Halloween parking situation and funded the upcoming Students of Color Conference.</p>\n<p>Although council members have hotly contended the request to form the new BCC over the past months, they decided it was a worthy addition to the association. Representative-at-Large Javier Martinez said the coalition’s ideals are aligned with those of A.S. and the University of California.</p>\n<p>“It continues in the tradition of the association’s activism and it’s about education,” Martinez said. “If we want to be the progressive campus we claim we are, this would be a step in that direction.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez said the bill was strongly supported by students, so representatives could do no better than respect constituents’ wishes.</p>\n<p>“These students came to us because they have a vision and wanted to make a difference on campus,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “I wouldn’t want to be part of a group that doesn’t let students contribute what they want to the campus.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council allocated the SOCC one-fourth of its special projects budget for the full year, equal to $4,284. On-campus Representative Joe Lee said such significant funding was warranted as the event will not only draw 1,000 attendees from across the state but also greatly empower the campus as a whole.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good way for legislative council to represent the student body, considering the large amount of hate crimes recently [reported] in our community,” Lee said. “That is something that we as A.S. should be concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council discussed Halloween parking. According to Student Advocate General Harrison Weber, students with a night and weekend pass from UCSB Transportation &amp; Parking Services will face a two-hour time gap during which the permits will not be valid. He said this raises not only logistical issues but greater problems within the parking system as well.</p>\n<p>“At a public forum last week, we asked if they could suspend the ban for a few hours and they said that was cool,” Weber said. “But apparently outside of the forum, that was not cool. We could all get a temporary pass or drive around for a few hours, but I think the principle that they can say something to our faces then go back on it is more important.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/","id":3150,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3149,3148,3147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin","biography":"Not available","articles":[3133,3134,3136,3148,3149,3150,3162],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s allocation wasn’t enough to lift the University out of its financial deficit. According to A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Doug Wagoner, UCSB will still face a $439.9 million shortfall in 2011-12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Wagoner said UC VP of Budget Patrick Lenz alluded to future fee hikes for UC students during a UC Student Association board meeting over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“[Lenz] danced around the fact that there’s probably going to be a 20 percent student fee increase in November and he also didn’t answer any of our questions very well,” Wagoner said. “I encourage you all to research more into the budget to see where the money’s going in our dire state.”</p>\n<p>The council also discussed the 1993 court case Smith v. Regents, which prohibits the use of student fees to lobby any proposition or candidate. A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez cautioned the council to remember its expenses are regularly audited in compliance with Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>“Taking a position either way on an issue is not a violation of Smith v. Regents,” Marquez said. “What is a violation is spending any student fees to defeat or support any particular proposition or candidate. However, the educational process is not a political process; I’d be putting out the message that we’re investing in the educational mission.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez questioned the legality of funding a group such as the Rock the Vote campaign, if the organization used the money to favor of a local candidate.</p>\n<p>Marquez recommended the council seek her advice when unsure whether an allocation was in line with Smith v. Regents, Off-Campus Representative and Finance Board member Chloe Stryker requested Marquez give a similar talk about the case at Monday’s Finance Board meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you had come and given that presentation [last] Monday, that probably would have changed the outcome a lot,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>Marquez then went on to discuss the Associated Students’ role in Steve Pappas’ lawsuit against Board of Supervisors Representative Doreen Farr, in which Pappas claimed that the Associated Students had potentially mishandled registration forms during the 2008 election. Though the case was dropped, Pappas has recently appealed the decision.</p>\n<p>“A.S. and the campus itself were subpoenaed as witnesses, and we were compelled to respond,” Marquez said. “We need to comply because the suspicion is that Associated Students was conducting voter registration that wasn’t following election code. We’re potentially involved, and that’s something you should all be aware of.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, Wagoner congratulated UCSA’s recent voter registration effort on campus. As of 11:30 Tuesday night, 5,284 UCSB student voters had registered for the upcoming election. UCSA hopes to register a total of 7,000 voters by the end of the drive on Monday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/","id":3147,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3146,3145,3144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Political Events Spur Debate of Fund Allocation","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Legislative Council discussed the context of a recent A.S.

Finance Board allocation during last night’s three-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The council conferred about the 1993 Smith v. Regents court case, which prohibited the use of student fees in lobbying for any particular political proposition or candidate. With that in mind, the A.S. Finance Board decided not to fund CalPIRG’s “Vote Float” parade during last Monday’s meeting for fear that the organization might align itself to a certain politician or cause.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the aforementioned legislation strictly regulates the manner in which college student governments can regulate funds.</p>\n<p>“It has been a requirement for elected students to ensure that they don’t support a candidate,” Marquez said. “You all receive honoraria so we can’t endorse candidates for that reason. Individuals in their own name can make an opinion about something, but they aren’t allowed to attach it to their office.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council debated whether T-shirts produced with student funds should be manufactured by a single company in order to establish a standard rate and save money for A.S. in the long run.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jamie Silverstein said the council’s budget gives representatives no choice but to lower its expectations for T-shirts they commission.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure T-shirts are made in an environmentally aware manner and ensure that they will be cost effective, but these two things go in different directions,” Silverstein said. “The group needs to decide if they want cheap prices or environmentally made T-shirts. The group needs to decide what they want out of their T-shirts.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said A.S. shouldn’t limit student organizations’ options by binding them to one shirt manufacturer.</p>\n<p>“A lot of groups on campus already have a partnership with different companies,” Lopez said. “They may already get cheaper prices there and if we make them go somewhere else we might make them spend more money than they would have otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually tabled the discussion.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Chloe Stryker said she was concerned that A.S. Finance Board is likely to run out of funds for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” Stryker said. “We could take away from winter [quarter’s unallocated fund] or just give away all our money in the next two meetings. If you know people that have events in Fall Quarter, have them come in as soon as possible because it’s going to become difficult to fund those groups.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/","id":3148,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3147,3146,3145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

While many board members thought the addition would fill a current void in A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, others felt another branch would add unneeded stress to current student government infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Chloe Stryker, who authored the bill, said the movement was practically retroactive.</p>\n<p>“I think HRC should have been a BCC to begin with,” Stryker said. “An OSL is very specific and this group is very broad. Also, obviously if they were working as an OSL, they wouldn’t have come to us. How does it look if A.S. is turning hundreds of students trying to build a coalition away?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said the absence of such an organization within the institution reflects poorly on the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>“It has to do with the way we are represented as a campus to our state, to our nation, to anyone who looks at the UC — they will look at our A.S.,” Mayorga said. “At this point, human rights aren’t even being addressed in our own student government.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis, on the other hand, said the association doesn’t have the funds to support a new board.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important to establish that the vote isn’t upon how necessary human rights are,” Lewis said. “It’s one of the most noble causes you can have in a BCC. But as A.S., we also represent the students and right now we’re in the recessionary period and other BCCs aren’t doing so well.”</p>\n<p>The council ultimately shot down the bill with a 13–9–1 vote.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council decided to take a stance against hate crimes towards the queer community.</p>\n<p>University Owned Off-Campus Housing Representative Alfredo del Cid cited a measure he had written in response to a recent rise in suicide rates amongst queer youth.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the language we use has no intent, but does send bad messages — such as saying, ‘that’s gay,’” del Cid said. “That has recently driven nine young people to death. I’m asking that we pass this, but also take a moment to reflect on what we do and say.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, the board approved a piece of legislation to support today’s Day of Action — a rally in defense of public education.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for us to show our support for this,” Representative-at-Large Jasmin Esparza said. “We need to stand by our students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-07/council-debates-creation-board/","id":3149,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3148,3147,3146],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
