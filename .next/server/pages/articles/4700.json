Sheriff’s Department (SBCSO) deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers were commended at the 46th annual H. Thomas Guerry Awards Ceremony in the Santa Barbara County Administration Building Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Five SBCSO deputies and three UCPD officers were awarded the H. Thomas Guerry Award for valor at the ceremony and several other local law enforcement officials were also celebrated for superior performance. The prestigious award is named after former Santa Barbara police detective H. Thomas Guerry, who was shot and killed in 1970 by two suspects attempting to rob a bar downtown.</p>\n<p>UCPD Corporal Gregory Pierce said despite the unfortunate circumstances, he is honored to attend the ceremony and hopes to bridge an understanding between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>“We’re all honored to be here, but it’s an unfortunate reason that we’re all standing here,” Pierce said. “But taking a positive attitude, building a relationship with the community and understanding what we do on a daily basis, what we’re capable of doing kind of put some closure to this event for the law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>UCPD sergeant Dan Wilson said community members should take preventative measures and reach out to the police if they have mental health concerns about someone.</p>\n<p>“We really need to work on the mental health aspect in our community, because that’s an epidemic that’s really facing our country right now,” Wilson said. “Usually somebody knows something before it happens, but they fail to report it. And, unfortunately, we’re unable to prevent that from happening.”</p>\n<p>According to Pierce, events such as Pizza with Police, Coffee with Cops and UCSB residence hall programs are a good start to communicating with residents and students.</p>\n<p>“I know that our agency at UCSB tends to do a lot more community outreach,” Pierce said. “We have the res hall liaison program, where officers are assigned to those res halls and they provide information and talks on how to be safe in Isla Vista. That’s definitely one that helps us build those relationships.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Pizza with Police is important because it “allows [the police] to be human” and allows the community feel more relaxed around cops.</p>\n<p>“They get to know us by name and they can actually feel comfortable approaching us, and that’s kind of breaking down those barriers because a lot of times, people don’t feel comfortable [so] they’re not going to say anything,” Wilson said. “A lot more students are approaching police officers and having a relationship and talking and you can see it by them saying thank you.”</p>\n<p>According to UCPD Corporal Bradley Prows, open communication must be ensured in I.V. because the police exist to serve the public.</p>\n<p>“We are there to serve them so you have to have an open dialogue back and forth that is a healthy exchange of ideas,” Prows said. “I mean if an officer were to tell you they aren’t interested in what you have to say, you’re looking at a fool.”</p>\n<p>Prows said Chancellor Henry T. Yang is bringing in officers from UCLA, UC Irvine and UC Riverside every weekend to maintain safety on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had that every weekend … officers coming in Thursday through Sunday,” Prows said. “There’s been a huge commitment on it on the part of the chancellor to ensure the safety of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Prows, the argument that there is too much police presence in I.V. has no basis, especially given the string of recent robberies this past week.</p>\n<p>“I think you could have a spirited debate between people saying it’s too much and people who are victims of either nonviolent or violent crimes that would say there’s not enough,” Prows said. “Especially this last week we’ve had three armed robberies, I’d have to argue that we don’t have enough officers.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said he approves of the university’s steps in taking “a bigger interest in the community” by providing alternative events to popular I.V. festivities such as concerts and fairs.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting together on different platforms to try to talk about issues and come up with resolutions,” Wilson said. “I think having different alternatives during these in advance, whether they’re planned or not, like the concerts, places for people to go — it’s the little things that make a big difference.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/","id":4700,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4699,4698,4697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun","biography":"Not available","articles":[2342,2590,2757,2768,2776,2777,2834,2853,2878,3455,4655,4700,4749,4785],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Locals Gather to Raise Awareness for the Houseless","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Houseless-Awarness-Night_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Houseless-Awarness-Night_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"“The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone.

The evening ended with long-term I.V. houseless resident Clyde performing Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” on the guitar.</p>\n<p>Hedges said while many people think of houselessness as an abstract problem, it is actually an issue made up of individuals.</p>\n<p>“They are not a population,” Hedges said. “They are persons who you can meet and know by name and by stories, not by what group they’re a part of.”</p>\n<p>Anyone can become houseless given unfavorable circumstances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>“In a blink, any one of us can become homeless,” Hedges said. “We’ve seen it happen. A house burned and that family becomes homeless. During the landslide, a lot of those folks became homeless for a while.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while nonprofit organizations need to create opportunities for houseless people, they should not try to “fix” them.</p>\n<p>“We stepped in and gave them [houseless people] a key to provide opportunity and advocacy to get their lives back together,” Hedges said. “They take it upon themselves to better their lives.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said houseless people have died in I.V. this past year, specifically his friend, Little Rick, who passed away after struggling with addiction and depression.</p>\n<p>“He ended up dying behind that … liquor store in Isla Vista,” Hedges said. “He drank himself to near death then died of hypothermia that night. He had no will to live, and it broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said people need to stop stigmatizing houselessness because it creates a “self-fulfilling” cycle.</p>\n<p>“There’s a set of characteristics homeless people have — low self-esteem, difficulty holding a job, etcetera,” Rawlings said. “If you tell them they can’t make it or they’re inferior or can’t do certain things, they will lose the motivation to try.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said society’s conceptions on homelessness do not reflect the root of the problem.</p>\n<p>“We carry in our heads bullshit of how the world really works,” Rawlings said. “What is true and what is legitimization — stories we tell ourselves that makes us feel better about the world.”</p>\n<p>Rawlings said common ideas on houselessness often underestimate the influence of economic and social forces.</p>\n<p>“Poverty is seen an individual problem — people are poor because they don’t work hard. They’re not the toughest of the lot, but that’s not true,” Rawlings said. “The basis of these B.S. theories on inequality is through an overemphasis on being individuals.”</p>\n<p>Common Ground Santa Barbara Volunteer Coordinator Stephen Gruver said houselessness is much harder than perceived.</p>\n<p>“You end up filling out dozens of paperwork to apply for anything, and people say homeless people are just getting free handouts, which may be true, but they’re working hard to get even the simplest things,” Gruver said. “I want to change the stigma that being homeless is easy.”</p>\n<p>Longtime Santa Barbara county houseless resident Jim said he wishes meetings like Houseless Awareness Night were more frequent.</p>\n<p>“I’m grateful it happens in the first place, it’s a good step in the right direction, but more needs to be done,” Jim said. “Only an hour and a half can’t even begin to explain what we go through every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jim, being houseless in Isla Vista is like living in a “war zone.”</p>\n<p>“At night we get this breeze from Alaska that will be like 10 degrees — you can die of hypothermia,” Jim said. “The kids don’t care and will run over you with bikes and you’re constantly living in a state of fear from being attacked or mugged or raped by anyone. The people here don’t give a damn about us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/locals-gather-to-raise-awareness-for-the-houseless/","id":4697,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4696,4695,4694],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

A CSD would be funded by local taxes and improve local infrastructure and public services.

We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this. – Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said the discussion on the financial feasibility report outlining the expenses of a CSD is unrelated to the current passage of the bill to committee. Schunk also said LAFCO “continuously misrepresents facts” regarding details of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Consistently property owners, long-term I.V. residents and other groups have been undermining the passage of the self-governance movement and AB 3,” Schunk said. “To say that AB 3 isn’t self-governance while recommending the existing power structures maintain control is not only disingenuous but also misleading.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said the LAFCO process of discussing financial aspects of a CSD is “crucial” in making the decision to endorse a bill.</p>\n<p>“At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward,” Soutar said. “We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Lanny Ebenstein said creating a CSD is a long overdue step, as shown by recent tragic events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was tragedy in many respects that led to this proposal coming forward,” Ebenstein said. “It was the clear evidence that the current government structure for Isla Vista is not working.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created. – Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch said Goleta should not partake in the CSD except to address issues of safety, such as establishing ordinances for Deltopia and Halloween weekends. According to Murdoch, these specific ordinances are county-wide and can be executed from within Goleta without the need for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created,” Murdoch said. “If I.V. was part of Goleta then specific unique ordinances could be drafted to solve these specific unique problems.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, conversations on the CSD’s financial feasibility will not be relevant for months to come and have distracted from the discussion on endorsement of the bill.</p>\n<p>“We will need the feasibility study to determine the rate of the tax but we won’t be determining the rate for maybe another year,” Abboud said. “The CSD law says you’re allowed to have a laundry list of taxes that can be specified later, it’s not important to the fast-paced process of the bill right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta City councilmember Michael T. Bennett said AB 3 is not perfect, but I.V. issues are intrinsically tied to Goleta city issues and should be supported by the council. Bennett said the effectiveness of the I.V. Recreation and Parks Department suggests a CSD that includes students and long-term residents could be successful.</p>\n<p>“I think as a beginning point it’s an opportunity for people to determine their own destiny,” Bennett said. “What gives me the most faith that it can actually work is, in fact, the Parks and Rec Department. When that was proposed there were many naysayers … but it has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectation and has shown that it can work with students and those that are residents with the community.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, committee members took a group vote to postpone the discussion to May 19 to discuss the matter with Mayor Paula Perotte, who could not attend the meeting due to sickness. The motion failed and the committee adjourned to regular meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*This is an updated version of this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63107\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63107\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/","id":4699,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4698,4697,4696],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
