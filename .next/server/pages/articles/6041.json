Needless to say, I didn’t really know the plotline or what to anticipate. But as a fan of David Fincher’s work (“The Social Network,” “House of Cards,” “Fight Club”), I knew it had to be good. After watching it, I can say that it is as good as, if not better than, any Fincher film.</p>\n<p>“Gone Girl,” based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, is a beautifully frightening film that tells the story of the complicated marriage between Nick and Amy Dunne, played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. The film centers on the mystery behind Amy’s unexpected disappearance on their five-year anniversary. As part of an elaborate scheme for revenge on her cheating husband, Amy disappears and leaves clues that frame Nick as a murderer.</p>\n<p>Nick has no idea where his wife has gone, but as more clues are revealed, they point to the idea that he had something to do with her disappearance. The police continue to investigate further and everybody in town starts to believe that Nick is responsible for the murder of his wife.  Throughout the film, he tries to piece together the reasons behind Amy’s disappearance while trying to prove to the world that he is innocent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Things get more and more complicated as events unfold and the truth comes out.  Filled with deception and suspense, “Gone Girl” will definitely keep you sitting at the edge of your seat and have you whispering, “what the fuck,” quietly to yourself at the ending.</p>\n<p>Before I spoil the movie even further, I’d like to share the lessons that I have learned from watching “Gone Girl”.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h3>You can’t force love onto somebody.</h3>\n<p><strong>“</strong>Gone Girl” paints painfully relatable scenes that depict the extreme bliss of beginning a relationship, followed by the desperate great lengths people are willing to go to save a relationship when it starts to fall apart. What we should all learn from Amy Dunne is to <em>not</em> do what she did.</p>\n<p>While she was a beautiful, intelligent and extremely cunning character, she was also mentally troubled, soulless and vengeful. It is heartbreaking for a person to let go of the significant other that doesn’t love them anymore, but manipulation and trickery are not the way to force the relationship to keep going.  Her plan may have been successful, but it could never happen in real life.</p>\n<h3>There are two sides to every story.</h3>\n<p>In the beginning of the movie, the audience is not given the full story. All signs point to Nick as the murderer and Amy as the victim. But when the film reveals Amy’s agenda, everyone stops hating Nick and starts to sympathize with him.  In the end of the story, the media and the townspeople are convinced that Nick and Amy are the perfect couple, not knowing the real truth about their relationship and the lies that they both told.</p>\n<p>Just like real life, it’s easy to make assumptions about people or situations after hearing only one side or source, especially when one is a close friend.  People are often biased and the only way to figure out the full, accurate story about anything is to ask everybody involved.</p>\n<h3>You should never alter yourself to fit someone’s mold of what is cool.</h3>\n<p>Amy tried really hard to become her husband’s idea of a perfect woman, whom she labels the “Cool Girl.” The Cool Girl is a “hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes and burping; who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth while somehow maintaining a size 2.”</p>\n<p>She’s the type of girl that’s “understanding, never gets angry and only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.”  Amy later admits that that type of girl doesn’t exist and that she never felt like she could be herself. She may have been a sociopath, but she serves as a reminder that altering yourself to please others never ends up well.</p>\n<h1><a

stepped onto the stage of the Arlington Theatre on Friday, Oct. 10, it was in a style only two cartoonists could pull off: wearing knit hats shaped like “Futurama” characters Nibbler and Bender and introducing themselves as each other. Such casual humor should be expected of any 40-year friendship, especially when it involves Barry, creator of the comic strip <em>Ernie Pook’s Comeek</em> and author of several novels, and Groening, best known for his comic strip <em>Life in Hell</em> and cartoon sitcoms “The Simpsons” and “Futurama.”</p>\n<p>The event, arranged by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, attracted a crowd of several hundred. Audience members ranged from young children to elderly couples, most in semi-formal attire. The huge theater walls were bedecked with balconies and lanterns to resemble the exterior of Spanish Mediterranean buildings. Depthless black covered the ceiling, and one could easily picture themself in a tranquil nighttime courtyard — at least, until the show began.</p>\n<p>First came iconic clips of the Simpsons and their antics: Bart showing Lisa his (accurate) illustrated prediction of their father being crushed by a garage door, Homer hurtling down a hill on skis as mounds of snow striked his groin and the entire family suffering epileptic seizures induced by a Japanese cartoon. The audience was roaring with laughter before Groening and Barry even took their seats in a corner of the stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The friends began their talk by recounting details of childhood. Barry described her Filipino grandmother, who sang in the kitchen and told far-fetched tales of monsters that attacked misbehaving children. Groening discussed how his family members influenced his most renowned characters. While cycling through a wealth of family pictures — taken by his father, a professional photographer — Groening revealed that Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie and Abe Simpson were named after his real life father, mother, sisters and grandfather, respectively.</p>\n<p>The discussion shifted to Evergreen State College, which the cartoonists both attended in the ’70s. Barry described the Oregon school as a liberal place where “everyone thought hippies would be around forever.” Groening first met Barry in college, upon learning that Barry had received a reply after writing to <em>Catch-22</em> author Joseph Heller, one of Groening’s favorite writers. The cartoonists recalled a number of their college exploits, from Barry’s temporary work as a nude model to Groening’s position as editor of the school paper, where he announced he would print “anything anyone wanted.”</p>\n<p>From there, Groening and Barry started talking about their artistic work. Barry, an experienced art teacher, encouraged artists and writers to work by hand rather than computer, because hands don’t have delete buttons. She played a video, showing lines drawn by a child juxtaposed with those drawn by Picasso in an abstract sketch and those drawn by a “physics dude” in a diagram. Barry insisted that such lines were alike in that they were all created by people getting ideas.</p>\n<p>Barry then showed the hilarious (but not entirely unrecognizable) results of her adult students sketching Marge Simpson for a minute with their eyes closed, to prove that adults who’d stopped drawing for years could still find joy in creating art. Not to be exempted, Groening and Barry made their own blind drawings on stage. Groening joked that he would sell his fairly accurate representation of Marge for five dollars, as Barry cackled at her own flawed attempt.</p>\n<p>While Barry leaned back in her chair feigning boredom when it was Groening’s turn to talk, and Groening laughed loudly at Barry’s humiliating stories, it was easy to see that this was a lasting friendship. The cartoonists ended their effortless exchange with an emotional hug, which might have lasted longer if they hadn’t reserved time to answer questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>The first question came from dedicated fan Matt Wallace, who asked if he could buy Groening’s drawing. Wallace, proudly displaying the sketch after the Q&amp;A session, stated, “I met Matt probably 20, 25 years ago … He was doing a book signing pre-‘Simpsons.’”</p>\n<p>Lucky, who at age 10 was the youngest audience member to ask questions, said one of her teachers “claimed” to have dated Groening’s father. Though a stunned Groening couldn’t confirm the statement, Lucky said of the event, “It’s really cool because I always watch ‘The Simpsons,’ and [once I] was Lisa for Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Fans old and new left the Arlington Theatre laughing. That night Groening and Barry were living proof of the agelessness of friendship and humor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/","id":6038,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6037,6036,6035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Recounts Night in Jail after BUI Arrest","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The purpose of the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Dept., according to their website, is to “utilize bike patrol and officers from the CHP and UCSB Police to provide safety and enforcement for the...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The purpose of the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Dept., according to their website, is to “utilize bike patrol and officers from the CHP and UCSB Police to provide safety and enforcement for the community of Isla Vista.” In a small community like ours, where the majority of citizens are college students, are people more afraid of the police officers or of the actual crimes? I am a 138 lb. woman, who had four drinks within an hour span on April 20, 2012, before attending the SBTRKT concert at the Hub. I am 21 years old and didn’t drink for over 2 hours until operating my bike and felt fine to ride my bike, or as the police like to call it, “driving your bike.”</p>\n<p>My friend and I are seniors fulfilling our last quarter at UCSB. At approximately 12:30 a.m., we were stopped on our bikes when we were eight houses away from our home on Trigo Road. The cops stopped us for not having bike lights on our bikes and then proceeded to ask us about our night. However, he eventually asked us if we had anything to drink. Shortly after taking the breathalyzer test five times, my BAC ranged from a .13 to a .14. Then I was handcuffed. The officers looked through our wallets and demanded the passwords to our phones. Subsequently, my friend scored a .156, and we were both in handcuffs on our way to the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>This is where my perception of the police force took a turn for the worse. My arresting officer, Officer Clocherty, was driving, and I was stationed in the passenger seat, and my friend was in the back seat with Clocherty’s partner. On the way to the jail, Officer Clocherty was tailgating going 90 miles an hour, rolling stop signs and talking to me about how he was a state champion wrestler in 1996. Not only did we get lost on the way to the jail, Officer Clocherty had to call his boss to see if he could legally take us to jail and had no idea whether a BUI was an infraction or a misdemeanor. When I told the officer he was breaking laws, he replied, “I have my lights on.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>My jail experience left me craving to reform the system that seems to only perpetuate crime, the very thing the police are meant to stop. I have never experienced such a loss of rights, a loss of freedom and a feeling that I was not in control of my own self.</p>\n<p>When I was being processed, Officers Clocherty and Alexander Fuller were exchanging jokes about an inmate I could see through a window. He was standing on a bench in his cell. Officer Fuller yelled, “Jump! Do it! Kill yourself!” and they both erupted into laughter.</p>\n<p>Once in the cell, I met Akemi Neufeldt, a student at SBCC who was arrested that night for a DUI. Although arrested for a DUI, Neufeldt was not driving the car. Neufeldt’s boyfriend was driving her car when he attempted to drift and he hit a parked car. Neufeldt and her boyfriend got out of the totaled car and waited until the cops came 30 minutes later. In that waiting period, Neufeldt took her keys and got her car insurance out of her dashboard. The cops came and arrested Neufeldt because she had the keys in her hand at their time of arrival and claimed her boyfriend, even though he stated he had been driving, was lying and covering for his girlfriend. They had reached their conclusions and took Neufeldt to jail, and her boyfriend went home free.</p>\n<p>The people with the power to take away our rights completely lacked compassion altogether. The jail guards were overly flirtatious and malicious, while the women jail guards were stereotypically on a power trip. Not every worker in the jail fits these descriptions; there were two people in particular, namely Officer Magri and another woman, that were exceptions to the rule. These are the people that should be celebrated. In the face of what seems like the Stanford prison experiment, these two people I will take note of as the people that retained compassion despite the norm.</p>\n<p>After 10 and a half hours of being in jail (for some reason we were in longer than the two DUI cases), we were released into another room where we awaited to be given our property. The mistreatment was not over. The woman checking us out, Dominguez, took 30 minutes. She conversed with her coworkers about life, and then got out our cell phones and purses and for some reason she felt the need to put them on the ground and kick them over to us.</p>\n<p>I am writing this because I believe people need to know. If the overall police system became entirely corrupt, would we have the means to overcome it? Whether you are being stopped on your bike for not stopping at a stop sign or given a ticket for not having a bike light or any other ridiculously distributed citation, people need to know that it happened. These citations are not given out to “protect safety.” Where are the police when real crimes occur in our neighborhood? Incidences of rape and violence are reported every weekend; burglaries are treated as an afterthought. An armed robbery just occurred last Friday, and the perpetrator is still out on the loose. The desire for a powerful position in society has clearly corrupted the minds of these police men and women. People that become police officers because they want the power are not the right people for the job for the very fact that they are power hungry. My sophomore year, I saw an SBCC student, Willy Stober, tazered by a police officer after he asked him not to give him a noise violation. The cop acted in this way because he felt “threatened by Stober’s friends and needed to set an example.” I asked Stober why he didn’t proclaim his innocence in court and he replied, “Who are they going to believe, me or a cop? It’s his word versus mine.” Change is in order and safety needs to be the ultimate priority of police, not exercising their seemingly limitless power on innocent bystanders.</p>\n<p>Katy Roberts is a fourth-year global studies major.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

But thanks to the groundbreaking filming tools of digital macro and motion macro 3D technology, viewers can now uncover a secret world underneath the waves. We’re talking about a world too small to be seen by the naked eye.</p>\n<p>Shot in the Bahamas, Fiji and Bimini, “Secret Ocean 3D” displays the interdependent relationships of marine life through octopi, Moray eels, arrow crabs and zooplankton spaceships. Over 40 species are observed in the documentary, enabling audience members to get up close and personal to underwater scenes like Squid City and Kelp Forest Avenue. With revolutionary filming techniques, director Jean-Michel Cousteau takes the world on the ultimate dive and shows how even the smallest organisms (on which the rest of the food chain depends) warrant as much protection as the dolphins and whales.</p>\n<p>“Secret Ocean 3D” will be screened downtown on Feb. 2. Jean-Michel Cousteau and his children Fabien and Celine were honored with the Attenborough Award on Jan. 28 at the Arlington Theater. Pick up the <em>Daily Nexus</em> next week for coverage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bD8gnSlZW8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones</p>\n<p>Arasch Blurfrushan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, stars of “The Theory of Everything” will be honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award in recognition of their career achievements, particularly for their acclaimed performances as Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde Hawking.</p>\n<p>Born in London on January 6, 1982, Redmayne started his performance career with the National Youth Music Theatre and made his stage debut at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in 2002. He scored his break with a minor role as Matt Damon’s son in the 2006 film “The Good Shepherd.” His rise continued with major roles in “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables.”</p>\n<p>Jones was born in Birmingham, England on October 17, 1983. The English actress’s first major role was the antagonist in the 1998 British TV series “The Worst Witch.” She went on to appear in “Doctor Who” and in a TV adaptation of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>. In 2011, Jones won the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize for “Like Crazy,” for her role opposite Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence. The actors improvised almost of all of the dialogue from a script outline.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” portrays the personal lives of the Hawkings and how instrumental Jane was in her husband’s success. Jones’s Oscar-nominated and moving performance excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle and her deep love for Stephen that allowed her to stay with him for years. A favorite for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Redmayne’s portrayal of Hawking’s intial stages of ALS was near flawless. Redmayne and Jones will be honored at the Arlington Theater tonight, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Salz7uGp72c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Confession”</p>\n<p>Alex Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Premiering in the United States at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, “Confession” is the debut feature of director Lee Do-Yoon. Nominated for three Korean Golden Bell Awards, the South Korean film is a neo-noir crime thriller that follows three friends: Hyun-tae, In-chul and Min-soo.</p>\n<p>After graduating from school, the three begin to lead separate lives. Hyun-tae and Min-soo take on calm lifestyles with standard jobs, while In-chul’s career as an insurance agent leads him to take some considerably criminal risks. When Hyun-tae’s mother tasks the three with burning down her casino in order to get the insurance money, things get rather complicated. If the film’s trailer is any indication, “Confession” promises to be a twisted, intense film.</p>\n<p>“Confession” will be screened downtown on Jan. 30 through Feb. 1.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JpRDHVlG2zk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Last Five Years”</p>\n<p>Bin Nguyen, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>Let’s be honest: were you a fan of “High School Musical” when you were a little kid? Well if you were (or secretly were), you will definitely enjoy this little film, since it is pretty much the adult, real-world version of HSM. Based on the Broadway musical with the same name, “The Last Five Years” is a romantic journey between two young individuals making their way in the city of New York. Struggling actress Cathy Hiatt, (Anna Kendrick, “Pitch Perfect”) and aspiring novelist Jamie Wellerstein (Jeremy Jordan, “Smash”) are a married couple going through the ropes of a modern 21st-century relationship.</p>\n<p>Unlike any other cliché love story, “The Last Five Years” is told in a very different way. Directed by Academy Award nominee Richard LaGravenese, the musical explores the history of the two lovers in opposite chronological order. Cathy’s point of view is told in flashback from the end of the marriage while Jamie’s version is told from the first time the pair met.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t catch spoilers in the last sentence, yes, the marriage did not last. Audiences get to enjoy the songs and music that pair with a slowly destructive relationship, while relating to the issues that every couple has to face.</p>\n<p>The main winner in this situation is the musical’s writer, Jason Robert Brown. While the Broadway musical is based on his own failed marriage to his ex-wife, it is Brown who has the final laugh as he now has written a highly successful play that has been produced internationally. So it must be true … nothing like a heartbreak to develop some real inspiration. Take that Taylor Swift! You’re not the only one making it rain by writing music about your failed relationships!</p>\n<p>“The Last Five Years” will make you laugh, cry, and sing along … maybe all at the same time. It will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 2 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dT0mrKzObw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies”</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60299\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"734258363\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60298\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60299\" data-attachment-id=\"60299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/mv5bmty1ndc4mja5mv5bml5banbnxkftztcwnji5njuwna-_v1_sx214_al_/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"214,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?fit=214%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60299 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=214%2C325\" alt=\"MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_\" width=\"214\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?w=214&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMTY1NDc4MjA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5NjUwNA@@._V1_SX214_AL_.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-60299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>imdb.com</em></p></div>\n<p>Follow the steady descent of Gilby Small’s life as he loses his job, his girlfriend and his apartment all in a single week. As a man in his thirties newly re-nesting with his eccentric mother, Gilby doesn’t have much going for him. But when a glimmer of hope appears on the horizon of his increasingly bleak life in the form of Rachel, his best friend’s married sister, Gilby sees no choice but to attempt to woo her … with a string of lies, of course.</p>\n<p>When he finally lies himself into a corner, Gilby realizes he must confront himself before trying to be with anybody else. Written and directed by Phil Allocco, “The Truth About Lies” puts a comically depressing yet endearing twist on the typical romantic comedy. It forces audiences to identify with Gilby, the big liar. What is the truth about lies? Maybe that we all do it to fabricate certain aspects of our lives and ourselves in an attempt to give others a wrong impression. Or maybe that lies can be occasionally well-meaning.</p>\n<p>“The Truth About Lies” will be screened downtown on Jan. 31, Feb. 1 and Feb. 4.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/artsweek-picks-for-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/","id":6040,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6039,6038,6037],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
