Colbert, who won two tickets to an advanced screening from a radio station in eighth grade, recognized immediately that “Star Wars” had changed everything and lamented the fact that none of his classmates yet understood his love for that galaxy far, far away. Although Colbert has been a “Star Wars” fan a whole two weeks longer than most people, ask any person who was young during the summer of 1977, and I bet they will have a similar story to tell.</p>\n<p>The success of “Star Wars: A New Hope” was truly unexpected and unprecedented: the film was turned down by United Artists, Universal Pictures and Disney, but was finally budgeted a measly $8 million by 20th Century Fox. It opened on a Wednesday in less than 32 theaters nationwide, with even George Lucas forgetting the film’s premiere. The film was an immediate smash hit — theaters quickly began demanding the film, and Fox’s stock price doubled in three weeks. “Star Wars” quickly became the most successful film they had ever released. All this from a film that Lucas so expected to flop that he wrote a self-contained storyline in case he was denied future funding.</p>\n<p>In 2012, after five more “Star Wars” movies and a handful of ill-fated TV specials and animated features, Lucas sold Lucasfilm, along with the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” properties, to Disney for $4.05 billion. With George’s empire now in their hands, Disney quickly announced a new trilogy of films, with “The Force Awakens” taking place roughly 30 years after the events of “Return of the Jedi,” as well as three stand-alone films focused on specific characters. The Internet, of course, went wild.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With less than a month left until “The Force Awakens” premieres in North America Dec. 18, 2015, how much do we actually know about the film? Unsurprisingly, very little, with a lot of room for speculation. Between a handful of teasers, two trailers (one Japanese) and a 60-second spot, we can infer a lot about the film.</p>\n<p>Even 30 years after the death of Emperor Palpatine, the galaxy still finds itself in a struggle for peace, with the Empire replaced by the New Order, led by a new masked darksider, Kylo Ren, a member of the Knights of Ren, a cult devoted to “finishing what [Vader] started.” Fighting against this new reign of tyranny are scavenger Rey; Poe Dameron, a member of the Resistance, which has replaced the Rebel Alliance; and Finn, a First Order deserter who is somehow in possession of Anakin Skywalker’s lightsaber (y’know, the one that Obi-Wan picked up when he left Anakin for dead and then gave to Luke, who lost it when his hand got chopped off in Cloud City. Yeah, that one). Guiding these young heroes along are near-mythical figures Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker (whose face has yet to appear in promotional content).</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to imagine a storyline for this film. Considered together, the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy tell the tale of the fall of a father and his eventual redemption through the help of his son and the triumph of good over tyrannical evil. From the second that he accepts Anakin’s lightsaber from Obi-Wan in “A New Hope,” Luke assumes the responsibility of being his father’s son, and all the good and evil that comes with it. The Rebel Alliance’s toppling of a monolithic, totalitarian and xenophobic imperialist regime was just a secondary benefit of Luke’s quest. And just as Obi-Wan passed the lightsaber on to Luke, just as George Lucas passed the lightsaber on to J.J. Abrams, just as the generation that saw “A New Hope” in theaters passed the lightsaber on to their children, the characters of the original trilogy pass their triumphs and struggles on to a younger generation — a new group of protagonists who are strong as the aging heroes grow weary.</p>\n<p>And that’s what this is all about, isn’t it? The passing of the lightsaber — the changing of the guard. “The Force Awakens” boasts an amazingly long cast of series veterans, many of whom are returning to these characters after more than 30 years away: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Leia Organa), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Warwick Davis (Wicket the Ewok) and Tim Rose (Admiral Ackbar). The project also employs veterans Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the scripts for “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” composer John Williams and sound designer Ben Burtt.</p>\n<p>And so it was with this “Star Wars” “brain trust” that J.J. Abrams embarked on his labor of love. With the help of Simon Pegg, whom Abrams treated as a sounding board, a generation that had grown up absolutely enamored by “Star Wars” was given the chance to play in the galaxy far, far away while working with many of the people who made the place what it is today. Many of Abrams’s choices hearken back to the original trilogy: heavy reliance on practical effects, scale models and actual set pieces in contrast to the prequel trilogy’s extensive reliance on CGI; the use of 35mm Kodak film and 65mm IMAX in contrast to the digital cameras used for “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith;” and the return of iconic ships such as T.I.E. Fighters, X-Wings, Star Destroyers, a massive spherical superweapon and, most importantly, the Millennium Falcon.</p>\n<p>“The Force Awakens” is a second coming of “Star Wars” in a world that was let down by the prequel trilogy. It is made to recapture the childhood that a generation experienced in the summer of 1977. There is absolutely no way that it will not succeed in terms of sales; the real challenge is changing the game and inspiring a new generation, like “A New Hope” did all those years ago. According to Disney, the film’s second teaser trailer, released April 16, 2015, was viewed more than 88 million times within its first 24 hours online. IMAX ticket sales quickly reached over $6.5 million for just the U.S./Canada market, shattering records set by films like “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Avengers,” which had garnered around $1 million each. Ticket sales site Fandango crashed repeatedly while “The Force Awakens” sold more than eight times the number of tickets of the previous record-holder, “The Hunger Games.” Analyst Phil Contrino has predicted that “Star Wars” will easily earn $1 billion and could cross into the next billion. (For reference, “Jurassic World” grossed $1.669 billion worldwide and current record-holder “Avatar” grossed $2.788 billion.) Not bad for a group of scruffy-looking nerf herders.</p>\n<p>Here are my thoughts to those who of you who are planning on seeing it — and let’s face it, even if you don’t think you’ll see it, you probably will, and if for some reason you are adamant about not seeing it, it’s probably going to be all you hear about until February — re-watch all six films. That’s right, six. Take in the entire story of the Skywalker family, both the good and the bad, because we may soon be moving on to a new lineage of heroes. Plan on staying off the Internet and social media starting Dec. 14. And if by some weird, freaky, miraculous circumstance you have a friend that has not seen a “Star Wars” film, do not by any means let them watch any before they see “The Force Awakens.” Drag your friend through their protestations — through their kicking and screaming — to see “The Force Awakens” with you. If it somehow ends up being bad, then your friend might be angry at you for a bit. But if it turns out to be anything close to what “A New Hope” was, then your friend will forever remember you as the person who showed them an amazing film that changed their life. You will have passed on the lightsaber and shown them what it’s like to live a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away …</p>\n<p>And the Force will be with you. Always.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66649\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/chewie-were-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66649\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/chewie-were-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/chewie-were-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/chewie-were-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/chewie-were-home/","id":5891,"author":{"id":778,"name":"Robert Johnson"},"related":[5890,5889,5888],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":778,"name":"Robert Johnson","biography":"Not available","articles":[5891,8049,8050],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Letter to the Editor: I’m Obsessed With Snoop","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In this Letter to the Editor, Risa Weber expresses her concern that celebrity culture is taking over her brain.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1758235165\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52466\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52484\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/letter-to-the-editor-im-obsessed-with-snoop/snoop-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?fit=800%2C1002&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1002\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"snoop\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?fit=800%2C1002&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52484\" alt=\"snoop\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?resize=800%2C1002\" width=\"800\" height=\"1002\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snoop.png?resize=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>It was 9:45 a.m. on a Wednesday when I realized that I have a serious problem. My professor had been speaking for 15 minutes but I hadn’t been listening at all. I was going through the motions of a responsible student, with my notes open, eyes attentive and head nodding, but none of her words reached my ears. Instead, I was consumed by a question that had been plaguing my thoughts and nagging at the very essence of my being for months: Why does Snoop Dogg (excuse me, Snoop Lion? Does anyone even know anymore?) love socks so much?</p>\n<p>It all started when I first followed Snoop on Instagram. Yes, that’s how familiar we are: I just call him “Snoop” now (#firstnamebasis). Snoop’s Instagram features awkwardly angled “selfies,” blunts, socks, Adidas gear and pictures of his kids. Let me describe a few of my favorite Instas:</p>\n<p>• A pair of slippers custom-embroidered with the words “Snoop Dogg,” a gold chain, G Pen vaporizer and a $2 bill, with the caption, “Essentials #slippergame #gpen.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>• One skinny foot sporting an orange, grey and black argyle sock, captioned, “Sock game!!

At first my friends and family responded with similar enthusiasm, but one by one, they became disinterested as I continued to shove pictures of Snoop’s socks in their faces. At this point, I was just beginning to use the phrases, “Sock game!” and, “What it do, nephew?” in daily conversation.</p>\n<p>As I got deeper, I spent more and more time thinking about Snoop. How does he stay so cool? Why does a grown man smoke so much weed? Why hasn’t his daughter taught him how to take a better “selfie”? Why does he wear so much jewelry when he goes on vacations? Where can I get myself some Snoop slippers? And what is up with all the socks? Then, I started thinking I saw Snoop in airport terminals and bus stations. Is that man in the orange shirt actually just Snoop re-living his Extravaganza experience?</p>\n<p>I downloaded the Snoopify app (highly recommended) in order to better understand the Snoop mentality, but when I took my own “selfie” and tried to Snoopify it, there was nothing I could add to make it more Snoop-y. The Snoop-session had gone too far.</p>\n<p>Residents of Isla Vista and scholars of UC Santa Barbara, I am asking you to come to my aid. These unanswered questions have my mind spiraling out of control. This ardent love of Snoop Dogg has taken its toll. (See? I’m even writing in rap form now.) I only hope that if my questions are answered, I may finally be able to focus on my studies and continue a relatively normal life as a student and a friend. So seriously, guys, da fuck is up with all the socks?</p>\n<p><em>Risa Weber is a third-year communications major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, my professor gave my class some personal advice. To sum it up, he told us to choose our majors and aspire towards certain careers for one reason and one reason only: a love for the subject and an interest in the profession.</p>\n<p>Later, during our weekly section, one of my classmates challenged what our professor had said, telling him upfront that it was probably the worst advice she’d ever heard. While he thought that careers should be based off of interest and natural talent, she thought it was completely irresponsible and impractical to ignore the economic concerns that vary between different career paths. With our undergraduate education costing around $30,000 a year, she argued that students could not simply wait around for the subject that “clicks” with them; students were making the right, informed choice when choosing certain majors that led to higher incomes. Money, being one of the fabrics of our society, plays an important role in the decisions we make as pre-career, undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>Yet if money were to be the only thing we based our decisions off of, why wouldn’t we all be engineering majors? Besides the fact that I would probably drop out after the first quarter, there is also the underlying yearning shared by all of us whether we like it or not: we crave passion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We hear both sides every day: “Follow your dreams,” and, “Find your passion,” versus, “This market has really good job opportunities,” and, “This career will make you a lot of money.” In high school, you may have taken a test that assigns you the professional career that fits you best. My results told me that I would excel at being a wedding planner, and while I do enjoy planning events such as parties and dances, let’s be honest: I’d much rather crash a wedding than plan one.</p>\n<p>Then my counselor told me that I should major in English because I scored well on the AP Literature test and on the writing section of the SAT. However, to me, writing essays upon essays for the next four years sounded more like selling my soul than attending college (no offense, English majors).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that in these early years of young adulthood, most students aren’t sure of what their passion is yet. We want to find it, but we just don’t know how. And the one thing we’re sure of is that money is important, because it lets you live comfortably and escape the worries of not being able to sustain the lifestyle you desire.</p>\n<p>Coming out of high school without a clear vision of what path to take or which passion to pursue, many freshmen (including myself) respond to the words “jobs,” “money” and “opportunity” with open ears. Is that bad? My professor would argue yes and my classmate would argue no. I say to hell with both of them. Yes, financial security is an important factor when making decisions about your future. Yes, happiness is also an important factor when thinking about the job you’ll be doing for the next several decades. But do these two factors have to be seen on the opposite sides of the spectrum? To say, “Yes, definitely,” would be as ridiculous as UCSB’s ranking at No. 2 instead of No. 1 on Princeton Review’s Top Party Schools (seriously, what is the deal with that?).</p>\n<p>So what’s the best answer then? There isn’t one really, or at least not one that’s the same for all of us. Although “money can’t buy happiness,” it sure as hell can put a roof over your head and a nice warm meal on the table. However, how you get that money is completely up to you. Chasing a goal solely for the end amount of cash isn’t the best strategy in the book. No matter who you are or what you’re after, you’re going to want have fun while you chase whatever it is you decide to pursue. Sure, an engineering major might statistically be better off than a psychology major, but the world we live in wasn’t built by statisticians. And we wouldn’t be college students in the first place unless we adhered to the motto “#YOLO.”</p>\n<p>As young adults, the only way we’re sure to avoid the constant, pressing advice of those around us is by locking ourselves in our rooms and shutting off all human contact, something I’d strongly advise you against doing. The thing is, it’s a natural tendency for those older than us to warn us about the future based of their own experiences or observations. But it’s our job to decide which advice we’re going to listen to and which advice we’re going to throw into the lagoon. Most importantly, take to heart the advice that is going to further your own interests and passions.

The film consists of reenactments of real-life stories of LGBTQ+ members residing in Kenya.</p>\n<p>The film lasts about an hour and contains five vignettes, titled “Ask Me Nicely,” “Run,” “Athman,” “Duet” and “Each Night I Dream.” The film is straightforward in its plot and execution: the stories are short and to the point, and the film itself is entirely in black and white. The stories range from the ups and downs of a relationship between two high school girls to a researcher hiring a male escort to visit him in his hotel room. Although the stories vary in the status of relationships and the severity of conflicts within them, all five reenactments involve a sense of urgency in keeping the extent of their sexuality private.</p>\n<p>Many queer Kenyans who express their sexuality face discrimination from strangers, peers and their own families. According to a 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, 96 percent of Kenyans believe that homosexuality should not be condoned by society. Very traditional religious and cultural values held by the majority of residents play a large part in sustaining the country’s deprecating views of the LGBTQ+ community. Men and women can face up to 14 years in prison for engaging in homosexual acts, possibly even 21 years if the encounter is considered to be under “aggravated circumstances.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Laws against discrimination or violent acts don’t protect queer Kenyans. If they are attacked in a hate crime, they’re unable to go to the police to report it without being charged with homosexuality. Many officials even encourage citizens to make arrests themselves if an officer isn’t present. Many are fired from their jobs or kicked out of their homes for being queer. The real-life stories portrayed in “Stories of Our Lives” show how pervasive these detrimental opinions are in Kenya and the immediate effects they have on queer citizens.</p>\n<p>In the first short, “Ask Me Nicely,” a student named Kate is suspended from school for having a relationship with another female student. “Run” involves a violent confrontation between business partners after one sees the other, named Patrick, walking into a gay bar. The final short, “Each Night I Dream,” follows Liz and her partner Achi as they wonder how they’ll respond when the police come to interrogate them about their relationship.</p>\n<p>Stories like these are common among the LGBTQ+ community in Kenya. The film was made by The Nest Collective in 2014 to bring awareness to just how prevalent these circumstances are. The Nest is a collective based in Nairobi that works to create discussion on important societal topics through the arts, including film, music, fashion and other visual arts. The collective gathered the interviews for the film by traveling across Kenya, recording only audio to protect the individual’s identities. The group’s $15,000 budget came entirely from a donation from Uhai/EASHRI, a sexual rights fund also in Nairobi. Reenacting the stories took 8 months of filming with just one DSLR video camera.</p>\n<p>The film is banned for distribution and screening in Kenya for “promoting homosexuality.” Most of the film’s crew has remained anonymous, but director Jim Chuchu, executive producer George Gachara and writer Njoki Ngumi released their names in an interview with <em>Xtra!, </em>an LGBTQ+ magazine based in Toronto. Shortly after they went public, Gachara was arrested for violating the country’s Films and Stage Plays Act.</p>\n<p>While it may seem to some that the world has become much more accepting of differences, it’s apparent that we are nowhere near complete tolerance. Stories like Kate’s, Patrick’s and Liz and Achi’s occur far too often. Films like “Stories of Our Lives” bring a much-needed awareness to a wide audience about how far we still have to go to achieve true equality.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/stories-of-our-lives-brings-awareness-to-prevalent-anti-gay-views-in-kenya/","id":5890,"author":{"id":733,"name":"Karrah Bates"},"related":[5889,5888,5887],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
