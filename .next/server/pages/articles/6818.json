Inside an interesting restaurant concert venue styled American, almost-Southern-European, bar and lounge, monochrome photographs depicting close ups of models in late 20th century fashion hang along the deep red brick walls. A bar stands stranded in the middle foreground of the dining area, separated from any walls. A brass framed mirror hangs on the lounge wall, reflecting warm, desert-sun casted, sand yellow lamps; thin cylinders pendant from the vaulted, wood-panel ceiling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating lightly zested, succulent, crunchy calamari while Dreamers warm up SOhO Restaurant and Music Club with some quick-paced, hard-thumping snare and bass, enveloped by roughened strumming. A tiramisu and raspberry jam covered cheesecake dessert shared with friends was delicious, while the DJ spun The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Miike Snow and MGMT’s “Kids” followed by Two Door Cinema Club, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Milky Chance; an array of recent chart favorites comfortingly raising the energy levels of visitors that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After enough DJing, Dreamers plug in and slam, shredding mercilessly upon their instruments. A dream-catcher hangs and trembles from lead-singer and guitarist, Nick Wold’s, mic stand. Three voices spill from the stage as drummer Jacob Lee Wick and bassist Nelson join Wold in vocal support. Along with the impeccable sound engineering at the club, the lyrical Dreamers kept SOhO moving.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging from the spray-painted streets of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the group has set out on their first tour. Now they are stationed in L.A. working on their album to be released in mid-to-late March. Surprisingly, this will be their first LP release, although an EP came out in November of 2014. The stage chemistry between the members along with the vibrations and melodies emitted from their instruments portrayed the band as congruous as old veterans.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their sound was not entirely unfamiliar, but stood out among others within their indie-rock genre. A mixture between Young the Giant and a more-garagey Two Door Cinema Club,Dreamers’ music kept the atmosphere buzzing and excited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their tracks “Shooting Shadows” and “No Love” cascaded throughout the dance pit, and “Wolves” shook the rafters, grey-painted metal pipes and the floor beneath the audience’s feet. The energy spewing from the audience stomping and jumping across the wooden floorboards harmonized fluently with the band’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightening up the crowd magnificently, Dreamers made way for Brazilian Girls! Immediately, the lights were dimmed and only the stage light set furthest upstage glowingly alighted the back of the stage in a light fade. This hardly provided enough light to envelop the drummer, Aaron Johnston, if anyone. guitarist Jesse Murphy, lead vocalist Sabina Sciubba and keyboardist Didi Gutman were left to prance around in the dark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the probable request for limited lighting by the band, they spun SOhO around and around until the audience was screaming for an encore at the end of the show. Their upbeat, dance-infused jazz and bossa nova peppered electronic reggae grew out of darkness, awing the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They opened with their new single, “Critics,” which elegantly introduced the public to the pleasant weirdness comprising a good portion of Brazilian Girls’ work. Later, favorites such as “Don’t Stop” and “I’m Still Sleeping” sprayed over the crowd. Thankfully not the last song in their repertoire that night, “Pussy” was performed toward the end of the show; it would have been the obvious choice, but not the only great one. Instead they closed with a “jammed” version of a past album track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd moved with the beat of the music. Sciubba’s alluringly mysterious stage presence crept throughout the space as the front rows shined bright white in smiles. She arrayed herself in a long, draping black sports coat over a deep blue tank top aflame in fire emblems of orange and yellow. Shiny royal blue tights in star emblems aligned her skinny legs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brazilian Girls effortlessly breathed vibrant life into downtown SB, enticing young and old to dance a night away in pure joy. As unique, strange or varied the troupe’s musical endeavors are, they maintained a danceable energy that locals of SB thoroughly inhaled, devoured, respected and enjoyed. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67590\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67590\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/brazilian-girls-dreamers-set-upon-soho/","id":6818,"author":{"id":727,"name":"Alec Hartnett"},"related":[6817,6816,6815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":727,"name":"Alec Hartnett","biography":"Not available","articles":[6818,6843,6928,7041,7062,7606],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Monterey Jazz Brings Campbell to Life","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jazz-e1453361766712.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jazz-e1453361766712.png?resize=400%2C393&ssl=1","description":"The air was still and brimming with excited anticipation in Campbell Hall on Thursday night.

A group of five men stood onstage with their silent instruments, illuminated by an outline of red light. Quietness and darkness permeated the theater. Then all at once the silence was shattered by a burst of vibrant music as the ensemble began to play, kicking off a night of jazz, fun and incredible talent.</p>\n<p>The versatile performers were welcomed by UCSB Arts and Lectures as members of the Monterey Jazz Festival on tour. The festival itself has showcased renowned jazz musicians since 1958 and the tour continues to share the magic of jazz music and the talent of the ensemble members. At their Thursday performance, they delighted the audience with a variety of musical styles and moods, all instruments blending effortlessly together while still remaining distinct.</p>\n<p>Gerald Clayton tied the ensemble together as the musical director and with his stunning and stylized piano. His steady, pounding chords provided a backbone for every song and solo, adding an extra punch to the rhythm. The centerpiece of his performance, however, was his masterfully fast finger work during his solos. His hands jumped from key to key with incredible dexterity, reaching the highest and lowest notes within seconds. His entire body moved with him across the piano as he played, creating sweeping and gliding sounds as he moved up or down the notes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>No jazz ensemble is complete without a captivating rhythm, and the MJF tour had Joe Sanders on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums to thank for that. Sanders shone during the opening and closing numbers with his fast plucking and rapid note changes. He plucked strings with ease, almost embracing his upright bass as it moved with him to the beat. Hutchinson’s pounding kick drum gave intense energy to every number, with plenty of the symbol flourishes characteristic of jazz music. Together, their collective beat created a full, rich sound that resonated deep within the chest and throughout the theater.</p>\n<p>Nicholas Peyton’s trumpet took center stage with its bright sound and spontaneous note changes. During “’Round Midnight,” Peyton began with low, whispery tones, creating a quiet atmosphere of mystery. Without warning, a long, high blow from the trumpet pierced through the mellow stillness, the clear tone filling the theater in dramatic contrast to the other, quieter instruments. Peyton enthralled the audience with his incredible, long, drawn-out notes that built to thrilling crescendos and his rapid riffs that added a fun personality to each number.</p>\n<p>Ravi Coltrane’s alluringly smooth saxophone provides a perfect compliment and contrast to Peyton’s trumpet. Coltrane’s solos began with long, lingering notes, allowing the sound of the instrument to grow and create a mellow atmosphere. He followed long notes with short bursts of sound and unexpected combinations of low and high tones to create a jazzy, improvised sound. During the second number, his harmony with Peyton’s trumpet was clear and smooth, giving the number a relaxed feel.</p>\n<p>With a rich, smooth voice and lightning fast guitar playing, Raul Midón had the audience roaring with applause after every number. During his solo songs, his ability to sing while playing the guitar and the bongos at the same time gave the illusion that there were three performers onstage rather than just one. At the beginning of “Sunshine, I Can Fly,” his vocals perfectly mimicked the sound of a trumpet while harmonizing effortlessly with his rapid guitar picking. The various elements of his performance worked together, his voice rising with his guitar and his lyrics settling into the rhythm he was creating on his own.</p>\n<p>The Monterey Jazz Festival tour was a showcase of classic jazz styles and dedicated performers. Each member of the ensemble added a key element of sound to the overall atmosphere of each song. In their solos, however, they each demonstrated a unique improvisational style and various techniques to change the mood from mellow to thrilling. Jazz is a music that focuses on the coming together of individual talent in organized chaos, and nowhere was that melding of music so perfectly arranged than the MJF tour.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-67583\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jordan Tritton / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>If you’ve ever cruised down Pardall on a Tuesday night, you might have passed a cozy open mic occurring at the Coffee Collaborative, and heard a quick snippet of what sounds like a guitar-percussion compilation straight out of “August Rush.” What you were hearing was in fact David Kuperman, a second year communication and philosophy double major from San Ramon, a slow suburb in the East Bay area. “Kupe,” as most of his friends call him, jams out with a unique style of guitar playing called slap guitar, which essentially incorporates rhythmic and percussive elements into regular guitar medleys.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t heard or seen his slap guitar stuff, picture a Jewish curly-haired dude intensely strumming a guitar, simultaneously smacking on it on certain beats and plucking the strings at seemingly random instances to produce a full sound that almost makes you believe there is more than one instrument performing. Or, you could just watch the video of his Batcave session, which works too.</p>\n<p>Kuperman sauntered into the <em>Daily Nexus</em> to record a Batcave live session looking like your everyday typical chilled-out rocker — not-quite-tattered-but-still-slouchy shirt, black earrings, a random assortment of necklaces and bracelets, a droopy baseball-esque cap worn backwards and, of course, holding a skateboard in one hand. Kupe is essentially the personification of the word “chill;” he easily lounges on a chair in the office while draping his arm across the back, casually joking around with a lazy smile on his lips. It’s hard to picture him getting worked up about anything, until that is, he picks up his guitar. All of sudden, a wicked gleam overtakes his eyes and he deftly busts out a few complicated-sounding chords while waiting for the videographer to set up his equipment, without breaking a sweat. His fingers seem to have a mind of their own and his gaze flutters from the guitar, to the walls, to the camera, all around as the rest of his body accommodates the melodies emanating from the instrument — complete with foot tapping and head bobbing. And we haven’t even started the actual session yet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When we finally sat down for an interview, Kupe effortlessly assumed his natural, laidback persona again, sinking into the couch while mindlessly tapping his foot. Again, the topic of music seems to stir him from this relaxed state into something more passionate. Not surprisingly, music has been a most of Kuperman’s life. “Since I was, like, a little one, my dad turned me onto a bunch of music he was listening to at the time, a lot of rock music.” It wasn’t until he was around eleven, after having played the saxophone for a short while, that he first picked up a guitar and formed an informal band with some friends, attempting to emulate popular rock giants such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Guns ‘n’ Roses. His interest in slap guitar came a bit later, after seeing a fellow guitarist Andy McKee on the Internet. “I remember on YouTube, there’s this video of Andy McKee playing this song called ‘Drifting.’ It was full of this crazy stuff, he was like slapping the guitar and doing all these crazy rhythmic things and I just thought like, ‘Wow that’s cool.’”</p>\n<p>If you watch this video and think, “Man, that looks like such a difficult style of music to perform, it must’ve taken him so much formal training to get the hang of it!” you’d be only partially right. While it did take Kuperman some time to master the style — “It was like learning how to play the guitar again, almost” — he never actually learned how to formally play slap guitar. Instead, he just sat down one day and started messing around with rhythmic and percussive elements until it blossomed into the impressive showing you see here today. “I think it’s just guitar playing with just a little extra something thrown in. Probably just comes from guitar players when they’re not playing with other people wanting to, and being able to, create a full sounding thing by yourself.” Not exactly an easy task, so it understandably took him a while to figure out the “rhythmic difficulties” involved.</p>\n<p>Foot tapping away, with what I now began to realize was a characteristic wild look in his eyes, Kupe began to excitedly tell me about how slap guitar style “opened up a new door of guitar playing.” He continued, “people find themselves so limited on one instrument, like you can only do this or this, standard stuff. But like, you know, this is an instrument and when it comes down to it, this is a thing that makes noise and sound and you can get so much out of it.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, the smaller, raw nature of the Isla Vista music scene, which welcomes talent of all shapes and sizes, suits David’s interests just fine. “That’s my ideal show: dingy show, relatively small place, but packed with people because then there are no rules and, like, it kinda has more character to it.” What he brings to I.V. is a unique, bluesy slap guitar style that can liven up even the dullest open mic or small house show. But that’s not the only form of music Kuperman hopes to perform here in I.V. “I’m forming a band right now, and this is me playing electric, which is very different from my acoustic playing. Basically my other musical half, my like, blues-rock alternative kind of playing — very loud and crude, but like energetic stuff.” This band will definitely bring an exciting underrepresented blues-rock sound to I.V. — once he finds a drummer that is, which has been the biggest roadblock he’s faced so far.</p>\n<p>Between electric guitar and acoustic slap guitar, it’s clear to see that, while slap guitar is what David calls, “my core, that’s my soul, some of the music I write that I really call my art,” he prefers performing his electric rock music. “It’s the performance, it’s the energy, like, it’s rock and roll, that’s more what it’s about.” Don’t worry though, you’ll still be able to catch Kupe jamming out with his slap guitar music around Isla Vista (and this Batcave session) pretty regularly, but he’ll soon be playing some loud, bluesy, alternative rock music with his to-be-determined band. If you just can’t wait, look his name up, “David Kuperman” on SoundCloud, or search him on YouTube to listen and watch a few of his original song compositions. Besides that, catch him tearing up the streets of I.V. at a house show near you soon enough, or pop into an open mic whenever you’re free — chances are you’ll spot him going nuts on a poor acoustic guitar, delivering some interesting and rock-inspired slap guitar melodies.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjdsnQyMvU&amp;feature=youtu.be</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/","id":6816,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6815,6814,6813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ghastly, Local Acts Make Sunday Funday @ SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pokemans_092.gif?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Swarms of drunken Isla Vistans descended upon SOhO Restaurant and Music Club Sunday night to jump up, down and all around to the show SELECT Entertainment and We the Beat lined up.

Individuals who normally show up 20 minutes late to their 11 a.m. classes actually arrived to the venue on time in order to support local artists Bucketz and DJ Prodijay. The venue was filling up long before Ghastly was set to go on stage.</p>\n<p>After some slight hassle and wait time to get into the venue, most of the crowd went directly to the bar. Bucketz was able to lure thirsty college students away from their tequila shots and over to the stage with some tasty house tunes. The dance floor was “lit af” and he was only half way done with his set. His support wasn’t only from locals either. I managed to talk to some folks from Santa Monica and Oxnard who told me they were glad they showed up in time to see the opener and couldn’t wait to find him on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>DJ Prodijay kept the hype building for Ghastly with his own blend of house. More and more people were entering the event and gravitating directly over to the stage, a tribute to Prodijay’s mixing. The demographics of the crowd made it feel like Isla Vista had literally taken over SOhO and decided to make it into the greatest house party.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Unfortunately, I spent most of Prodijay’s set waiting in the cursed bathroom line, making bathroom-line friends that I’ll probably never see again. By the time I got out and back on the dance floor, Prodijay was wrapping up his set and SOhO was the most packed I’ve ever seen it. When Ghastly finally came on in the late hours of the night, the crowd was well past drunk and very, very hyped for the headliner.</p>\n<p>Ghastly’s set had all the components of catering to a crowd that was as energetic as any Sunday night. He dropped some nasty beats and paired them with colorful visuals that combined to turn the house party into an all-out rager. Audience members were getting low and pushing around so much that I had to take a step back and watch from the safety of the sound booth corner. Frat dudes lost their shirts and girls ended up on shoulders for the ‘gram — a true sign of a performance well done.</p>\n<p>With the show done, audience members reluctantly left the venue in search of their Ubers and after parties to continue the great experience at SOhO. I managed to snag a spot on a random bus that had no intentions of turning down anytime soon. Seeing local artists build such a great atmosphere for an up-and-coming artist like Ghastly is something I hope to see more of in the future. Kudos to all those that contributed to making that Sunday one for the books, y’all crushed it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/ghastly-local-acts-make-sunday-funday-soho/","id":6817,"author":{"id":122,"name":"Sohila Sandher"},"related":[6816,6815,6814],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
