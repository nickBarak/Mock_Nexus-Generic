Additionally, the council discussed the Halloween parking situation and funded the upcoming Students of Color Conference.</p>\n<p>Although council members have hotly contended the request to form the new BCC over the past months, they decided it was a worthy addition to the association. Representative-at-Large Javier Martinez said the coalition’s ideals are aligned with those of A.S. and the University of California.</p>\n<p>“It continues in the tradition of the association’s activism and it’s about education,” Martinez said. “If we want to be the progressive campus we claim we are, this would be a step in that direction.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez said the bill was strongly supported by students, so representatives could do no better than respect constituents’ wishes.</p>\n<p>“These students came to us because they have a vision and wanted to make a difference on campus,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “I wouldn’t want to be part of a group that doesn’t let students contribute what they want to the campus.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council allocated the SOCC one-fourth of its special projects budget for the full year, equal to $4,284. On-campus Representative Joe Lee said such significant funding was warranted as the event will not only draw 1,000 attendees from across the state but also greatly empower the campus as a whole.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good way for legislative council to represent the student body, considering the large amount of hate crimes recently [reported] in our community,” Lee said. “That is something that we as A.S. should be concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council discussed Halloween parking. According to Student Advocate General Harrison Weber, students with a night and weekend pass from UCSB Transportation &amp; Parking Services will face a two-hour time gap during which the permits will not be valid. He said this raises not only logistical issues but greater problems within the parking system as well.</p>\n<p>“At a public forum last week, we asked if they could suspend the ban for a few hours and they said that was cool,” Weber said. “But apparently outside of the forum, that was not cool. We could all get a temporary pass or drive around for a few hours, but I think the principle that they can say something to our faces then go back on it is more important.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/incorporates-coalition-extensive-debate/","id":3150,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3149,3148,3147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Potential Policy Change Spurs Council Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Council members debated the logistics of the bill, including vague wording in the resolution, its committee membership requirements and endorsement policy. The board ultimately tabled the measure until next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of Internal Affairs Jake Elwood said it’s crucial for the council to reach a decision by their next meeting.</p>\n<p>“The deadline to make changes to this year’s elections committee is week five [of winter quarter],” Elwood said. “If we do not vote by then, the changes will be made for next year.”</p>\n<p>However, Representative at Large Chloe Stryker said she couldn’t support the bill as written because of its lack of clarity. Stryker said its vague language could potentially violate the A.S. Legal Code’s bylaws.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of things in this bill that I think are a Judicial Council hearing waiting to happen,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>The board also discussed the resolution’s proposed candidate endorsement procedure. As specified in the bill, if a current elected officer endorses a candidate for the 2011-2012 academic year, the officer will be penalized and lose pay, among other consequences.</p>\n<p>“For endorsements, I don’t think that you should be using your position to endorse a candidate,” Stryker said. “But does that mean that an officer cannot post ‘vote for this person’ on their Facebook without losing their honoraria and having to pay back tuition?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the endorsement clause of the bill does not specify what constitutes “official support” for a candidate.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can get some clarification from the elections committee,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Representative at Large Miles Freeman, on the other hand, said he supported the bill because the electoral process is in dire need of change.</p>\n<p>“I know this is a complicated bill,” Freeman said. “This was a bill essentially drafted, created and compiled by the elections committee and I think we should rely on the elections committee to make this decision.”</p>\n<p>However, On-Campus Representative Alfredo del Cid said the council must first discuss the matter with the elections committee before making a decision.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/","id":3151,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3150,3149,3148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Additionally, the board discussed potentially videotaping council meetings, Governor Jerry Brown’s proposed 2011-2012 budget and efforts to create a student-run cooperative café in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha and Lambda Theta Phi members John Salas and Lidia Rivas, respectively, requested $1,350 to fund t-shirts and food for an upcoming event encouraging low-income high school students to pursue higher education.</p>\n<p>Rivas and Salas said UCSB sociology assistant professor Victor Rios agreed to speak at the event for free if organizers bought a copy of one of his books for each participant.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said the arrangement would violate University policy.</p>\n<p>“UC faculty cannot be paid for speaking anywhere in the UC,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>After reviewing its budget records, A.S. Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht discovered that the association had already funded the group $1,100 in November. The council eventually allotted an additional $500 for food and $168 to donate eight of Rios’ textbooks to the four participating high school libraries.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov submitted a proposal to record legislative council meetings. Tzankov said the recordings would not only create more transparency within A.S., but also prevent campus media outlets from misquoting council members.</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said recording meetings could deter council members from voicing their opinions.</p>\n<p>To avoid calling attention to closed meetings, Tzankov said the council could post recordings after the meetings in lieu of releasing a live feed.</p>\n<p>“Last year there were … issues that came up and we had to go into a closed meeting and so I don’t know if a live feed is the way to go,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid, recording meetings could make the council more accessible to the student body.</p>\n<p>“To us, A.S. is this great thing, but to many students it seems like this exclusive group,” Del Cid said. “[Recording meetings is] definitely better. … Most students don’t want to go through lines of minutes.”</p>\n<p>The proposal was ultimately tabled for future consideration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Kaily Burton said the council is considering funding a student-run restaurant at the former site of On The Side on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>Burton said the restaurant, which would be modeled after a similar venture in Berkeley, would sell locally grown organic foods.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/legislative-council-discusses-videotaping-meetings/","id":3152,"author":{"id":212,"name":"Dominic LoBuglio"},"related":[3151,3150,3149],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
