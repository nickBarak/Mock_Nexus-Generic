But after my first time, I realized that sex was great. It was the key to my maturity — it was liberating! And not just intercourse itself; all aspects of human sexuality fascinated me, from courtship to first kisses to all that sexy, dirty nastiness that follows. I mean, if Helen of Troy could bring down an entire empire because some guy wanted to bang her, the sex must have been worth it.</p>\n<p>I mean, if you think about it, what is every living being’s ultimate goal? Survival. And what is survival if you cannot pass on your quality traits to the next generation? Whether you like it or not, you have been hardwired to reproduce, and therefore 99% of us humans are sexually charged (excluding the Shakers and those who identify as asexual, of course).</p>\n<p>Whether you’re waiting for marriage or have already lost count of your I.V. flings, you have to understand that we all have urges. Think about your relationship with food: When you’re hungry, you eat. And when you deny yourself food, that urge to eat doesn’t just go away — it actually worsens over time. Horniness is strikingly similar to hunger. It is a completely natural human drive, one that has kept our species alive for thousands and thousands of years. If we hadn’t explored this primal instinct from the very beginning, our kind would have wasted away, starving for the nourishment we could only give to each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Obviously we don’t need to repopulate the Earth anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean these urges have faded away. Plain and simple, sex feels good, and so does eating. The brain releases pleasure signals when you feed and when you fornicate — think of the evolutionary “Four Fs”: fighting, fleeing, feeding and fucking, all controlled by our friend, the hypothalamus. So why deny yourself of two of the greatest feelings in the world?</p>\n<p>Of course, there is always the problem of overindulgence. What happens when you overeat? You develop a wide variety of problems, your ass included. We all know obesity is one of the most pressing health issues in America, along with Type II Diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Sex can have a hefty price tag as well. Unplanned pregnancy, STIs and the emotional trauma that can arise from risky behavior are just some of the reasons why so many preach abstinence.</p>\n<p>But my tried-and-true motto? Everything in moderation. Find a balance. If you can physically and emotionally handle a hookup every night of the week, go for it! If you want to slow things down with a committed relationship, that’s cool too! Fine with taking things in your own hands for a while? Dandy! I, myself, at 4’9” and a hundred pounds, cannot eat five heavy meals a day, but I still have my favorite, go-to recipes. And of course, a light snack every once in a while certainly curbs the urge.</p>\n<p><em>Echo Meyers is a first-year pre-biology major.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

Traditionally, women are expected to be groomed, cleaned, styled, primped and prepared from eyelash to toenail. Consider women’s hairstyles alone: there’s the length, color, style and occasional accessory. Ladies will spend countless hours in front of the damned 360-degree full-length mirror, perfecting their reflections until they feel like someone off the latest cover of <em>Vogue</em> … and that’s just for a quick trip to the DLG. Obviously, this is an exaggeration, but the clothes we wear, the makeup we put on and what perfume we use are all factors that are being analyzed each time we leave the house.</p>\n<p>Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to get laid. Generally speaking, men have a much shorter list of things they have to do to get a partner’s attention, but that doesn’t mean that these few things aren’t just as vital. For the guys who have either mastered the outdoorsy vibe that drives some people wild, have guitars strapped to their backs or drive Bugattis, water through the hair and the occasional shave will suffice. However, for the remaining 99.99% of men, there are certain prerequisites that must be fulfilled before anyone will seriously consider you for their favorite position.</p>\n<p>So here is a starter’s guide for those of you who don’t know the difference between shampoo and conditioner – there is one, by the way. You guys can thank me later, when someone, if not a plethora of someones, is suddenly dying to hop into your (hopefully clean) sheets.<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"42693919\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51719\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51722\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/the-hurdles-to-jump-before-you-hump/new-image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=800%2C574&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,574\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"New Image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?fit=800%2C574&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51722\" alt=\"New Image\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image-250x179.jpg?resize=250%2C179\" width=\"250\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New-Image.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It’s as basic as asking a store clerk, “Hey, do these fit?” Pick something simple that works for you; less is almost always more. I know the end goal is to get someone in your pants, but if you can literally fit them inside while still wearing said pants, it might be time to go for a slimmer fit. That being said, make sure your jeans aren’t so tight that they cut off circulation to the parts that need it most – find a happy medium so you can make your medium happy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Clean Up, So You Can Clean Up</p>\n<p>Basic rule of thumb: If your grandmother wouldn’t approve of your living conditions, chances are, neither will your partner. Do the dishes, pick up your dirty clothes (or at least hide them well), hell, maybe you could even do your laundry. Basically, if your place is so dirty that you don’t want to be there, what makes you think that your partner is going to feel any different?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do the ’Do or Chop the Mop</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much time to throw some type of product in your hair to at least make it look like you tried. With great hair comes great responsibility. And if you simply can’t muster up the energy to show it the respect it deserves, throw on a tasteful hat (three-gallon maximum). If long hair is too much of a commitment and you just can’t find the right hat, don’t be afraid to get your buzz on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If I Can Taste It, It’s Too Much</p>\n<p>Once the previous steps have helped you get a date, don’t expect that the smell of your Irish Spring bar soap is going to wow them into your arms. Using soap is a great start, don’t get me wrong, but once you’re out of the shower, a spray or two of something that doesn’t come in a can will definitely give you an advantage. Ditch the Axe and invest in a glass bottle. But make it last – use sparingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be Minty Fresh</p>\n<p>Few things are more disappointing than getting excited and intimate, only to inhale your partner’s dinner breath. No one wants sloppy seconds from your egg salad sandwich. Brush your teeth, eat a mint, chew some gum or use mouthwash … we really don’t care. Keep your dinner a mystery and you just might get dessert.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chivalry: Back with a Vengeance</p>\n<p>Okay, so it’s old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining armor. Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody. Go the extra mile so that they will too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If these ideas sound scary or revolutionary, you’re probably the guy who has the most to learn from them. These are pretty simple concepts and although there’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get some, I can just about promise you that if you neglect to follow these steps, the odds will never be in your favor.</p>\n<p><em>Haley K. never leaves the house without a fresh mani/pedi, a double coat of lip gloss, the perfect balance of bronzer and blush, and exactly seven spritzes of Daisy by Marc Jacobs. </em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of the June 26, 2013 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I dream a dream of perfectly mowed, or at the very least nicely trimmed, meadows in the pants of men everywhere. Yes, you young rapscallions, you, today we will be discussing the importance of manscaping. About damn time.</p>\n<p>If you are a man, you may wonder: when should I trim the ball-fro? A rule of thumb: If you’re going to show it, mow it. Your most sensual apex should be a metaphorical front lawn. Don’t be the scary man down the street whose home is lost in the undergrowth. The one that requires the local EMTs to hack down the grass with a machete to cart out your critically sex-starved body … OK, I’ll admit I got carried away with that metaphor. Just remember you want the yard to look nice.</p>\n<p>I recommend having your crotch trimmed. If you are a generally hairy guy, don’t shave it. Imagine going to the zoo and seeing a gorilla. Now imagine that gorilla has crudely shaved only its genitalia. Take that horror and ponder it for a moment. A trim will suffice.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for the rest of it, I’d say, anywhere you want licked should be shaved. Balls and shaft should be devoid of hair. If you get random hairs growing on your dick, pluck that stick. I do not want a hair dislodging itself at the back of my throat. It will tickle and perturb. Just as you wouldn’t get hot watching your cat cough up a hairball, you won’t enjoy my deep human suffering at the hands of your misgrooming. If you are well-maintained, your options for fellatio open up. A girl may be more eager to take your sack of goodies into her oral cave of wonders if it doesn’t result in having wet hair in her mouth. Yes. I hope you are as disgusted as I was while writing that sentence. Wet hair.</p>\n<p>Now, there may be some discomfort when the hair returns if you opt to shave. When it grows back it will prickle and tickle your sensitive giblets. Remember, waxing will mean a) that you won’t have to maintain it for at least a month and b) it will grow back thinner and softer than before. It is a choice only you can make. Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>If you do opt to shave, I recommend the proper set of tools: a good razor dedicated solely to your bits. There is something dehumanizing about shaving your face with a razor that has a pubic hair on it. If you want to be well-prepared, buy Coochy Cream (*insert rambling dialogue by spokesperson of Coochy Cream*). This is a shaving cream dedicated solely to handling your nether-lands. It permits you to shave against the grain which may be easier and it limits shave bumps. Consider it a sexual investment, my friend.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone cares about this stuff. You can adjust according to your partner. Perhaps you’ll land someone who likes the springyness of your bush and has made peace with the initial digging that must occur.</p>\n<p>And ladies, though you are generally better versed in this song and dance, remember that the same rules apply. At the very least, you should maintain your bikini line. Communication is key, people. If you want it from your partner, you need to ask, tactfully. I recommend one of two options that work for me. You can: A) ask if they want something like that from you. It opens the door and makes it reciprocal. “Hey, what are your preferences for how I keep it down there? Do you want it shaved? You do? OK, would you mind doing the same for me?” Or B) “Hey, I think it would be really sexy if you were bare down there …” Mention it offhandedly, flirtatiously. “Imagine all the things we could do …”</p>\n<p>And so, my little horny toads, I leave you with this applicable quote from one of my role models, Dr. Evil of Austin Powers: “There’s nothing quite like a shorn scrotum … It’s breathtaking … I suggest you try it!”</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has better things to do than look for a needle in a haystack.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of the Wednesday, April 24, 2013 print edition of the<em> Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-24/gents-tame-your-man-mane-and-let-your-inner-lion-find-his-roar/","id":6353,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6352,6351,6350],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Role-Playing: How and Why You Should Try It","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/doctorandpatient.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/doctorandpatient.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"R.

According to our oh-so-omnipresent source of Wikipedia, it represents a form of foreplay that involves two or more people who act out roles in a sexual fantasy. While that explanation more or less adequately portrays the technicality of the act, let’s thrust deeper. My definition of sexual role-play? It’s freedom. Pure, steaming and explosive freedom.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, non role-players question the allure of the act. Why pretend to be someone else when you have a perfectly capable self to be? Why not leave the dress-up and acting for Halloween? This, my friends, is where the freedom comes in. Sexual role-play builds for an almost excruciatingly erotic scene that allows you to overcome many of your sexual inhibitions, at any time and at any place. It grants you permission to access your deepest desires, your innermost fantasies and your most desperate wishes. Want to be tied up and dominated? Have your partner rip your clothes, strip you, bind you, whip you, whisper dirty diction as you grow more and more aroused — any or all of the above to quench that temporary bondage binge. Want to reenact the classic scandal between teacher and pupil? Find a spare room, set up a desk and whiteboard, decide on who teaches and who learns; dress the part and start off like it’s a one-on-one detention session or a last-minute lesson on linear algebra. Then there’s the prisoner and prison guard, the Sleeping Beauty, the dutiful robot, the repairman and the naughty wife, the photographer and the model, the celebrity and a lucky fan … Possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>On top of that, role-play possesses no confinement to physical, in-person play. It can occur via phone, email or an online chat room. It also holds no prejudice against two partners or five as well as a private setting or an open show for suspecting — and unsuspecting — audiences. This is your sexual fantasy put to life, so live it like you want to, folks.</p>\n<p>For the expert role-players, I tip my hat to you and cheer you on. But for the newer actors and actresses just starting out or are contemplating dipping their feet in the fun, here are some tips:</p>\n<p>1. Immerse yourself. Absorbing the essence of your character and your scenario will provide for a more realistic scene. As for generic, easier stories, you can get by from watching some films or using your imagination to hurl out that cowboy drawl or pretend you know anything about teaching. But for some of you ambitious role-playa-playas, be sure to do your research. My boyfriend and I once played out a hypnotist scene, and while it was still hot and heated, I realized midway that I wasn’t fully sure of routines or phrases hypnotists use on their clients, and role-play verbiage became a bit stilted. Of course, it’s important to note that everything depends on your seriousness for the play and your demands on realism. If you’re just messing around and having fun, laughing between scenes and guffawing about the awkwardness is a-okay. But if you want that penetrating experience, get down to business and get into it.</p>\n<p>2. Obtain appropriate props, set a good scene. Again, this depends on how serious you are about the role-play. Some people rent or buy equipment, secure a desired location setting and obtain the appropriate costumes; others work with what they have and simply use a single item to sustain their scene. It doesn’t matter, because you don’t need to go all out in order to feel the sexual steam of role-play. However, props certainly do help accentuate the reality of the scenario and the roles, and visual affirmation acts as a stimulant not only for your eyes but also for your libido.</p>\n<p>3. Just have fun. Ultimately, this isn’t about practicing for an acting audition or memorizing a study guide. We’re just here to unlock our fantasies, and hell, if we’re going to give them life, then we might as well live them up.</p>\n<p>In the end, let’s just say the doctor from the aforementioned scene quenched his desire for release, and the patient calmed her “itch.” And what was left at the end? Two nude college students, laughing on their dorm bed about an amazing night’s play.</p>\n<p>Role-play on, Humpers, and role-play hard.</p>\n<p><em>R. Pengsta highly recommends regular checck-ups with your favorite doctor.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
