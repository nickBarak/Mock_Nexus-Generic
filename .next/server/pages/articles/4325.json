It has yet to prove it can consistently win on the road as it is currently 2-4 away from home.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s definitely one of our goals.” Checketts said. “We have to be able to win away from home, we play tough teams and we have to be able to beat them at their home.”</p>\n<p>And this series will be exactly that; a tough road series. LBSU has beaten quality teams this season at home and currently holds an 11-5 home record. UCSB won two of the three game series last year, however, the games were close.</p>\n<p>“They are a solid team and we remember them from last year.” Checketts said. “We have to be ready for them and I believe we will.”</p>\n<p>The Dirtbags success could be attributed to their strong pitching. Currently they are third in the Big West in team ERA (2.92), third in hits allowed (177) and third in opposing batting average (.230).</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff is sophomore Darren Mccaughen (4-0). The right hander ranks fourth in the Big West in ERA (1.62), second among starting pitchers, after allowing 10 runs in 39 innings pitched while also striking out 34 batters which ranks 10<sup>th</sup> in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The sophomore is expected to get the start in Saturday’s game. Starting Friday’s game will be sophomore Chris Mathewson. The right hander has a 3.55 ERA which is not the best but his 40 is second best in the conference and best on his team.</p>\n<p>Although it has had great success, LBSU cannot take UCSB and its strong hitters lightly. Currently it ranks first in the Big West in slugging percentage (.411), on-base percentage (.398), runs scored (154, RBI (132), and second in batting average (.281).</p>\n<p>One quality that makes Santa Barbara a truly dangerous team is the fact that at any time any of the nine hitters in the line-up can have a career game or series.</p>\n<p>The same was true for redshirt sophomore Josh Adams who was named Big West Field Player of the Week. Adams received POTW honors after a great week in which he batted 5-12 (.417), six RBI, and one home run. He currently leads the team in home runs with four.</p>\n<p>Other notable gaucho hitters are redshirt junior Andrew Calica who leads the team in on-base percentage (.504), sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover who has the best batting average (.410) and redshirt sophomore Austin Bush who has the best OPS (.927) on the team.</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos this weekend will start with junior Shane Bieber on Friday, freshman Noah Davis on Saturday and redshirt sophomore Joe Record on Sunday.

It added to its lead in the seventh thanks to an RBI walk from sophomore David Banuelos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tried to rally in the ninth inning as sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher hit a single that eventually led to him getting on third base, however, closer Chris Rivera recovered for the Dirtbags and picked up his league-leading 11<sup>th</sup> save of the season.</p>\n<p>Although he picked up his third loss of the season, redshirt sophomore Joe Record (3-3) had another solid outing going 6.1 innings deep and only surrendering three hits and one earned run.</p>\n<p>Hitting wise, Fisher, redshirt junior Andrew Calica and sophomore first baseman Austin Bush, were the only players that registered a hit for Santa Barbara on Sunday.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s match-up, both pitching and batting was key to the Gauchos win that clinched the series and gave them a solid start to conference play.</p>\n<p>Led by Bush, UCSB racked three runs on eight hits, three of which came from the sophomore, and held LBSU to one run to secure a victory.</p>\n<p>The scoring began early when Hampson hit a solo shot to give the Dirtbags a quick 1-0 lead after one inning. Freshman pitcher Noah Davis (3-0) responded by allowing only six hits the entire rest of the way.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tied the game in the fourth inning after sophomore second baseman J.J Muno hit an RBI single down the right field.</p>\n<p>They took the lead in the seventh inning after junior utility Billy Fredrick hit a sac fly to left field which allowed redshirt freshman catcher Rowan Thomas to score.</p>\n<p>Muno extended the lead in the top of the final frame to take a 3-1 lead for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the stretch sophomore pitcher Kyle Nelson continued his brilliant start to the season allowing no hits or runs and securing his fourth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Davis also pitched another solid outing which prevailed him to keeping his perfect start to the season. The freshman picked up his third win after going eight innings, allowing seven hits and one earned run while striking out five batters.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s game, the Gauchos picked up some great momentum after winning its Big West opener thanks to great hitting.</p>\n<p>UCSB started off the game sluggish down 2-0 after pitcher Shane Bieber allowed two runs in the bottom half of the first inning courtesy of junior catcher Daniel Jackson’s RBI single and sophomore outfielder Brock Lundquist’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara responded quickly with two runs of its own in the top of the second frame as Bush hit a solo shot homer and sophomore Josh Adams was able to score on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitchers settled down and took control of the plate again as the score was 2-2 until the top of the fifth when the Gauchos took the lead for the first time after Calica hit a solo shot home-run to make the score 3-2.</p>\n<p>The Dirtbags were able to respond in the seventh inning as they tied up the game at three apiece when Hampson hit a one-shot homer. Beiber was relieved by Nelson after the homer.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took the lead once again immediately in the top of the next frame as it again scored on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>Nelson then took the game into his hand as he retired the four of the final five batters picking up his then third save of the season.</p>\n<p>Although there were moments of sluggish batting/pitching, UCSB managed to put together another excellent weekend, the first of conference play, and start the Big West season the right way.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also able to show that they are capable of winning road games against tough opponents as they were able to take a series from the No. 16 team in the nation.</p>\n<p>Now as it takes a week off from conference play coming up, it will be interesting to see if Santa Barbara can stay grounded and stay focused.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is Friday, April 8 against College of Charleston at C of C Baseball Stadium at Patriot’s Point at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Foot Patrol, UCPD deputies, Santa Barbara County Fire and American Medical Response medics responded to an initial report of an unresponsive college-aged male on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive at around 10 p.m., according to an SBSO press release.</p>\n<p>The unconscious male was lying in the backseat of a vehicle, and his housemates stated he had ingested narcotic pain reliever Oxycontin and an unknown amount of alcohol. He was immediately transported to a hospital.</p>\n<p>While officers and deputies were still at the scene, another male who had stopped breathing was carried out of the residence; a Sheriff’s deputy administered a single dose of Narcan, or naloxone nasal spray.</p>\n<p>The victim began to breathe after receiving the dosage.</p>\n<p>Officers and deputies conducted a wellness check of the residence. Around 20 college-aged students were gathered inside the residence and seven of the students were exhibiting symptoms similar to a drug overdose.</p>\n<p>Several of the subjects transported to the hospital were UC Santa Barbara students, according to the release.</p>\n<p>The students showing symptoms of an overdose had reportedly consumed a “blue pill.” Nine male subjects were transported to the hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p>Eight of the patients have been released from the hospital. The ninth is expected to be released from the hospital today.</p>\n<p><em>This story will be updated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
