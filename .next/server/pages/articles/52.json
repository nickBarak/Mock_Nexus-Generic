The new pair was able to beat the Lobo pair of sophomore Ruth Copas and freshman Cassie Chung, 6-2. The pair was able to play well in an important set, which gave the Gauchos a good start and the important doubles point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting singles play for the Gauchos was Silveira, who bounced back in her individual play against her doubles competitor earlier in the meet, Dulski, by winning scores of 6-4 and 6-2. Gilbertson also bounced back like her doubles partner and won her match in singles play against New Mexico’s Chung, 6-1 and 6-3. The last Gaucho to pick up a victory in singles play was Atanasson, who was able to beat Olivier. The remaining three matches in singles play were left to be unfinished after sophomore Atanasson’s victory, and the Gauchos were able to earn the victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos went into this game coming off of a five-game road trip, which ended on a sour note. The team suffered two straight losses with one delivered by the University of Washington Huskies, ending in a straight sweep of the meet, 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thankfully. UC Santa Barbara was able to bounce back extremely well in this match. Playing their first game back home since Feb. 12, the delayed start wasn’t the ideal situation for the Gauchos to earn the victory, but the team was able to settle into a rhythm that they were unable to in their previous match. The victory ended Santa Barbara’s two-game losing streak and the team was in control from the beginning to the end of the meet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the New Mexico Lobos, the loss to the Gauchos comes at a time where the team is struggling. The team is now 1-9, having not won a game at home or away. The team’s only win was at a neutral site against the University of Wisconsin Badgers on Feb. 18. Since then, the New Mexico Lobos have been on a four-game losing streak, and the team was once again unable to clinch the doubles point, something the team has failed to do in every game they have played this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara has a packed schedule this upcoming weekend, playing two games in two days. The Gauchos will play the University of San Diego Toreros on Thursday, March 9, and the University of Denver Pioneers on Friday, March 10. The Gauchos will travel for their last game on Sunday, March 12, against the Pepperdine Waves.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76247\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-blank-lobos-despite-weather/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76247\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-blank-lobos-despite-weather/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-blank-lobos-despite-weather/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-blank-lobos-despite-weather/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-blank-lobos-despite-weather/","id":52,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[51,50,49],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Set to Welcome Cal and LBSU to Campus Diamond","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One game behind the .500 mark, the UCSB softball team will attempt to remain within the top of the Big West Conference standings as the Gauchos are schedules to face Cal this Wednesday and Long Beach ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In hopes of staying within the race of the Big West standings, an important week awaits the UCSB softball team.

It’s really just about getting back to playing clean softball,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “We’ve had a lot of different people step up who continue to get clutch performances.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears play with a powerful offense which consists of three standout players who together account for most of the team’s success. These players hold the top positions in the batting lineup, and are powerful hitters all around.</p>\n<p>Cal’s sophomore utility player Jazmyn Jackson will be a focus for the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as she holds the team’s highest batting average of .390. Jackson has scored a total of 26 runs this season on 57 total hits. She has also contributed seven doubles and 16 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Another key contributor for the Golden Bears is sophomore infielder Kobie Pettis. Pettis currently possesses a team-leading 26 RBIs this season. She has also slugged two home runs along with recording 10 doubles. Pettis also bats owns a .356 hitting clip and has a total of 15 runs scored this season off 42 hits.</p>\n<p>Despite her freshman status, Cal infielder Lindsay Rood has been a consistent force in the Golden Bears’ batting rotation, leading the team with 34 runs scored this season. She’s also registered a total of 20 RBIS, five doubles, two triples, and three home runs.</p>\n<p>Following two resting days between its contest versus Cal, UCSB will return to the field to face Long Beach State this Saturday.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have strengths in both hitting and pitching, making them an extremely versatile team and a tough opponent. Junior starting pitcher Christina Clermont is sure to see the mound this weekend as she has established her presence with a 14-7 record while tossing a total of 142.2 innings this season while accumulating a 2.11 ERA. Clermont has given up 43 earned runs, and has recorded a solid 144 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Complementing LBSU’s pitching will be its performance at the plate as well. Senior third baseman Darian Tautalafua has dominated Big West play, earning Player of the Week after hitting 4 home runs in Long Beach’s series’ victory last weekend against UC Davis. Tautalafua leads her team in almost every offensive category. She has slugged 12 home runs this season, along with six doubles and one triple. Nonetheless, her abilities at-bat are phenomenal as she bolsters 44 RBIs and has notched an on-base percentage of .421.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Nichole Fry has also made moves this season, and serves as a secret weapon for the 49ers. Although she holds a lower spot in the batting lineup, she has tallied a total of 26 runs scored this season and seven doubles, all while holding just a .250 average.</p>\n<p>In hopes of returning to its playing form in which it began the season with, UCSB will be led by the veteran talent of senior infielder Arianna Palomares. She is currently second on the team in runs scored with 25 and has 26 RBIs this season.</p>\n<p>“We just need to play together. We’ve seen glimpses of the best that we can do, but it’s going to take all of us being on at the same time and really clicking,” said Palomares.</p>\n<p>Freshman second baseman Seirra Altmeyer continues to prove her talents among the lineup as well. Altmeyer leads with 30 RBIs and 12 doubles this season. She also holds an on-base percentage of .383, while contributing 15 runs scored off of 37 hits.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow and freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin will be sure to split the Gauchos upcoming games. Ludlow has provided 130 innings of pitching this season, while giving up 53 earned runs and striking out 127 batters. Gulvin has also provided 95 solid innings while giving up 47 earned runs and striking out 58 batters.<br>\nThe Gauchos will take on the Cal Golden Bears at 2 p.m. this Wednesday, April 20. On Saturday, April 23, UCSB will play Long Beach State at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. The final game of the series will take place on Sunday, April 24 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well and threw a complete game in collecting her eighth win of the season. Facing 31 batters, Ludlow allowed only two earned runs and nine hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as the wind at Campus Diamond picked up, so did the 49ers in their 14-6 win in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader.</p>\n<p>The start of the second game looked promising for the Gauchos when in the first inning senior catcher Samantha Stark hit a double to left field, bringing home junior infielder Kristen Clark and sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston, giving UCSB a 2-0 cushion.</p>\n<p>Stark was one of the biggest playmakers on the day for the Gauchos, finishing 3-4 with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of fire, we were just really excited and we had a lot of fight within us,” Stark said.</p>\n<p>The second inning would expose a weak Gauchos’ defense, as UCSB suffered from major fielding errors. With just one more out needed to get the Gauchos out of the second inning, a UCSB error on a deep ball into left field resulted in the 49ers’ first run of the game.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the only unearned run Long Beach would score, as the 49ers tallied four more unearned runs in the second, putting the score at 5-2 until UCSB finally recorded the third out. Long Beach State’s first ten runs were all unearned.</p>\n<p>There was a hopeful moment in the third for the Gauchos when they cut the 49er lead from three runs to one thanks to a clutch double to center field from junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos, scoring Menor and junior infielder Emily Brucelas on the play.</p>\n<p>This was the closest the Gauchos would get, as the 49ers collected another five runs in the fourth, and another four in the seventh. Cavazos also had a big day for the Gauchos, going 2-3 at the plate and finishing with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s final game was a blow to the Gauchos confidence, as they were shutout by the 49ers, unable to put a single run on the board. Long Beach however had a different day as they piled nine runs on UCSB in just five innings.</p>\n<p>The young freshman pitcher Ashley Wright saw some action in the last 1.2 innings of the game, providing much needed relief. She allowed only one hit and struck out one.</p>\n<p>Ludlow, however, took the loss after tossing 2.2 innings and giving up five earned runs off of 6 hits. She was unable to strike out any 49ers. Gulvin also pitched .2 innings in the game, but was quickly relieved by Wright when she gave up four runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB had only two hits in the game, one each by Junior infielder Emily Brucelas and Arianna Palomares with Brucelas’ hit coming on a double in the third inning. Long Beach starting pitcher Christina Clermont threw a complete game, striking out 9 Gauchos and walking none in picking up her 16th win of the season.</p>\n<p>“We have to just keep fighting. With our conference, anything can happen so we have to keep fighting and doing what we have to do,” said Stark.</p>\n<p>Following the weekend, the Gauchos now sit at 22-25 overall and 5-7 in Big West play. The 49ers improved to 26-17 overall, 6-6 in conference play. Long Beach is currently ranked third in the Big West standings while UCSB is close behind ranked fourth. UCSB will prepare to face Hawaii at home next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-25/ucsb-wins-one-unable-to-halt-cal-and-long-beach-state-rallies/","id":50,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[49,48,47],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping to Make Late Surge in Home Finale, To Celebrate Seniors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_4-23-16_8-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_Softball_4-23-16_8-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the opportunity to possibly ascend to a potential clinching of the No. 2 seed in the Big West standings over the next two weeks, the UCSB softball team will attempt to end its two-game losing str...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a tough weekend at home for the UCSB softball team, the Gauchos will remain at Campus Diamond this weekend in hopes of overcoming their recent two-game slump with an opportunity to improve their record against the visiting University of Hawaii.

However, the Wahine lineup includes several talented hitters who may pose a threat to the Gauchos’ pitching staff.</p>\n<p>One of these hidden talents is the Wahine’s sophomore utility player Rachel Lack. Although Lack hits fairly low in the batting order, she has a team high 20 RBIs so far this season. Most notably, despite a meager .200 hitting clip and nine runs scored, slugging the softball out of the park appears to be her optimal strength as she has also banged out a team high five home runs.</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman utility player Sarah Muzik has proven to be a stand out hitter as she leads the team with 25 runs scored this season. Muzik hits third in the lineup with a .282 batting average. She has contributed three doubles and five RBIs this season.</p>\n<p>Behind Muzik with 24 runs scored this season is senior outfielder Keiki Carlos, who also has 40 hits. Carlos leads Hawaii with a .296 batting average and nine doubles. She has also tallied 12 RBIs and three home runs this season.</p>\n<p>The Wahine’s sophomore starting pitcher Brittany Hitchcock will come into the series with a 9-13 record and a 2.28 ERA. In 138.1 innings pitched, she has given up 45 earned runs and 153 hits this season.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho lineup should not have much trouble getting through to her, as collectively they are hitting .301, and have scored 203 runs this season.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Kristen Clark will be sure to bring the heat in this weekend’s matchup. She leads UCSB with an outstanding .420 batting average and 37 runs scored this season. She’s also contributed two doubles and 16 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Alongside her is senior infielder Arianna Palomares who has had clutch performances lately, scoring a game-winning homerun in last weekend’s series opener against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>Palomares has tallied in a total of 27 runs scored this season, along with three home runs. She has also contributed 29 RBIs which is second best on the team right behind freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer who leads with 34.</p>\n<p>Another Gaucho player who will be on Hawaii’s radar is junior infielder Emily Brucelas who has made her way to the top of the lineup, contributing 25 runs scored this season. She has slugged a team-high four home runs along with Altmeyer, and has contributed 22 RBIs. Brucelas has also banged out seven doubles.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to limit their opponents to a .290 batting average. Starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow continues to fight for her team on the mound as she has collected a total of 135 strikeouts this season. Ludlow has maintained a solid 2.96 ERA, giving up only 61 earned runs in 144.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The first game of the series will take place on Friday, April 29 at 3 p.m. The following two games will take place on Saturday, April 30 at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. All games will be played at Campus Diamond.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/ucsb-hoping-to-make-late-surge-in-home-finale-to-celebrate-seniors/","id":51,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[50,49,48],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
