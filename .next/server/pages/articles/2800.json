Food Bank funding and events to commemorate the anniversary of the May 23rd tragedy.</p>\n<p>During yesterday’s meeting Senators passed a “Bill to Re-Envision the Role of the Internal Vice President” and sent “A Resolution to Support the Mental Health Services Act,” “A Bill to Update Policy 37 Media and Publicity,” “A Bill to Define the Special Elections Process for Spring 2015,” “A Resolution in Support of A.S. Food Bank as a Food Center” and “A Bill to Update the Eligibility of EOP Grants” for review by the University Affairs Committee.  The senators also introduced several administrative bills and resolutions regarding A.S. Legal Code, sending them to committee for review.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lt. Mark Signa updated the senators on Deltopia crime statistics and said there were 206 citations issued and 145 arrests made during the festivities. Thirty-five of those arrested were UCSB students, 15 were SBCC students and 95 were unaffiliated with either school.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, although the number of arrests was “moderately high,” a reduction in medical emergencies and violence proved to be a positive change from last year’s Deltopia. Signa said the success of this year’s Deltopia occurred due to the concerted effort of students and community members to host alternative events and keep it local.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I contribute success to is actually not law enforcement, but student efforts and the community and people coming together to make this a successful event,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa also said UCPD aims to reduce the number of officers deployed during Deltopia in the future, but that any reduction would be based on circumstances.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s the general goal of all of this: to reduce the number of officers,” Signa said. “This year we had about 220 officers throughout the day … I think that’s definitely something we can look into reducing.”</p>\n<p>Zach Goulhiane, UCen Governance Board member, Senator and third-year chemistry and political science double major, told the Senate that Kaplan Inc.’s lease on their space in the UCen is ending soon and UCen administrators are weighing their options for how to use the space.</p>\n<p>“Their contract ends in October 2016 so they’re trying to decide whether to use that space as still Kaplan or have someone else rent that spot,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Student Chair Katie Freeze, Vice Chair Erick Lankey and Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen  gave a presentation to the Senate to encourage the Senate to pass “A Resolution in Support of the AS Food Bank as a Food Center,” which seeks funding to expand the Food Bank’s services.</p>\n<p>“The idea we came up with is expansion of educational programs, such as conference outreach,” Freeze said. “And ideally we want a community food center and a demonstrations kitchen where students can go if they don’t have access to a kitchen.”</p>\n<p>According to Lankey, the campus’ grant of $75,000 for the A.S. Food Bank from UC Global Food Initiative and UC Office of the President (UCOP) ends in 2016, and the organization’s fee initiative ends in 2017. Thus, to continue servicing the volume of students that use the Food Bank, the organization will need additional funding, Lankey said.</p>\n<p>“We are going to need additional funding, ideally from the campus, to give us a base of $150,000,” Lankey said. “The idea is that we have $75,000 from lock-in and then a match of $75,000 to be provided.”</p>\n<p>Lankey said the food bank currently services about 2,500 students and is projected to serve 3,000 students by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, receiving additional funding will help the food bank improve their services and thus work toward their goal to reduce the number of food bank-reliant students.</p>\n<p>“We’ll be able to provide higher quality food for our students in the long run,” Freeze said. “More culturally-appropriate food at our bank as well.”</p>\n<p>Freeze also said the A.S. Food Bank is collaborating with other campus organizations for the Edible Campus Project, an endeavor started by alumnus and musician Jack Johnson and his wife Kim that aims to eliminate local food insecurity, co-led by the Food Bank, the A.S. Department of Public Worms and UCSB Sustainability.</p>\n<p>“Another thing we’re looking to do is to increase food production,” Freeze said. “We are in partnership with the Department of Worms and UC Sustainability to start on-campus gardens.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Community Adviser Diana Collins Puente discussed the upcoming two-week campaign for the anniversary of the May 23rd Isla Vista tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Many efforts are underway at UCSB and Isla Vista to commemorate the anniversary and give the community the spaces in which to come together in healing,” Puente said.</p>\n<p>Events will include a candle light vigil, a march to Del Playa, a paddle out held by the Surf Club, the opening of Isla Vista’s Love and Remembrance Garden and the lighting project, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/","id":2800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2799,2798,2797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

For this reason, the committee motioned to pass $0 for seven of the eight requests made by student organizations.</p>\n<p>The UCSB League of Legends club requested funding for food for an upcoming event and the Women’s Club Water Polo captain, third-year Heather Borek-Klempfner, asked the committee to provide funds to help the team travel to Vermont, California for the Pacific Coast Division Championships.</p>\n<p>Money was also requested for the Black Pioneers’ Renaissance Organization’s annual Black <em>Women’s Appreciation</em> community outreach program on May 14 and to fund a Films for Funds project to show movies for $1 on Sundays at Isla Vista Theater to raise money for non-profits.</p>\n<p>Because of the lack of funding for Office of Student Life line item, the committee was unable to approve funding for any of these six student requests.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos member Juan Carlos Gomez requested to reallocate funds granted previously by the committee to reserve the Hub for a dance during the fraternity’s College Link Outreach Program to reserve the Music Bowl, instead. The event usually attracts 120 high school students from the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>\n<p>“We were awarded $350 to reserve the Hub because we throw a dance for them on the second night of the program,” Gomez said. “Unfortunately we were unable to reserve the Hub.”</p>\n<p>A.S. University Affairs also requested approval for the reallocation of $10 from honoraria funding into special projects. The committee approved both requests.</p>\n<p>Tri Delta Philanthropy Chair Cyrena Gonzalez requested funds for the sorority’s iHop charity “all you can eat” pancake event to take place on May 8 from 6 to 9 p.m to benefit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.</p>\n<p>“We have been partners with them since 1989 and we have raised about $40 million for them as a national sorority,” Gonzales said. “This will be our sorority’s first year doing it and I can tell it’s going to be very successful.”</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta Philanthropy Chair Carly Stewart requested funding for the sorority’s annual kickball tournament on May 16 to raise money for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program, a national organization that trains individuals to represent children in court who don’t have access to lawyers.</p>\n<p>The committee also passed the motion to fund $2,598 of the requested $5,195.50 by the Vietnamese Students Association to fund its culture week beginning May 11, which includes an educational workshop, Vietnamese food tastings and a fashion show.</p>\n<p>Fraternity Delta Sigma Pi also received funding for a $250 start-up and the Community Financial Fund was granted $320 in senate allocated funds for honoraria.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Walk a Mile in Her Shoes began in 2001 in Northern California and has since grown into a worldwide movement, with tens of thousands of men donning heels to demonstrate the importance of the cause.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … – Sigma Pi Herald Austen Mauch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Kevin Duong said he hopes the event will help alleviate the negative image of fraternities contributing to rape culture on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“I loved this event. My high school took part in walks every semester and seeing it take place in college is an absolutely amazing sight,” Duong said. “We, as fraternity men, want to work with the community to benefit everybody and having the thought of ‘Oh, X fraternity is prone to sexual violence against women’ leads to adversity in our mission.”</p>\n<p>According to Sigma Pi Herald and third-year biology and economics double major Austen Mauch, the UCSB Greek community stands against sexual violence and is actively trying to reverse the negative stigma surrounding fraternities and rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, I do know that statistically 1 in 6 women are a victim of sexual assault, every two minutes someone in America is raped and 1 in 4 college-age women will be sexually assaulted during their time in school,” Mauch said. “Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … We wanted to bring this issue to the forefront of everyone’s mind so together, everywhere, we can change the violent culture we unfortunately see today.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said UCSB is not the only university where sexual violence occurs and that altering people’s perspectives can be a first step toward changing the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“Many people do not understand the struggle that others have to endure,” Mauch said.  “By taking the opportunity to walk in someone else’s shoes maybe we can begin to understand what others are subjected to … Until everyone, every brother and sister, son and daughter, mother and father, friend and neighbor, can walk alone with no fear of sexual violence we haven’t done enough. Until everyone can go anywhere at any time without fear of sexual violence we have not done enough.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways. – Third-year biology major Kevin Duong</p></blockquote>\n<p>Duong said the event was successful if even one person changed his or her opinion on fraternities.</p>\n<p>“One thing to note is that sometimes events like these don’t feel like it was ‘successful’ but in my eyes, even if one person was swayed to change their opinion then it was successful,” Duong said. “If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said while it was difficult walking in high heels, this was his favorite part of the event because it allowed him to better relate to those who choose to wear them.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely an eye-opening experience,” Mauch said. “It was incredibly difficult and tiring and made me truly appreciate what women and men go through when choosing to wear heels. I believe the event went very well, and through our constant chanting on the walk of ‘listen, believe, support’ definitely drew most people’s attention and hopefully inspired some inquiry into sexual violence awareness and prevention.”</p>\n<p>According to Duong, the students participating in the walk received positive support from bystanders as they marched through I.V. toward Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part was actually when we started entering I.V. past the Pardall Tunnel and our entire group started chanting, ‘listen, believe, support’ while doing our walk,” Duong said. “It showed that we not only were men who could change our footwear for a mile, but that we were willing to, as a collective, voice our concerns for the women in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said by attending the event, participants made a promise not to be passive bystanders when it comes to preventing sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“They were pledging to stop sexual violence, and that any and every time they see anything questionable anywhere, they will not stand idle,” Mauch said. “We need the culture to change. We need everyone to speak out, stand up and not let the violence continue.”</p>\n<p>According to Kappa Sigma Grand Master Guillermo “Memo” Llamas, the event went through multiple stages of planning.</p>\n<p>“Preparing the event required filling out forms, reserving the plaza, making posters and signs, and spreading the word to invite as many individuals as possible to the event,” Llamas said. “Leading up to the event there were several educational workshops geared towards improving sexual violence awareness.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said his fraternity chose to host Walk a Mile in Her Shoes to fulfill the community service requirement which all Sigma Pi chapters must complete because he thought it could make a significant impact.</p>\n<p>“The high heels were supposed to symbolize the struggles of women and anyone who identifies as a woman,” Mauch said. “Having a group not accustomed to the struggles of women would have an opportunity to walk a mile from their perspective.

Storke Plaza as a final event for their Armenian Genocide Centennial Commemoration Week.</p>\n<p>ASA held a weeklong event beginning this past Monday to educate students and the campus community about the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians beginning April 24, 1915, as well as the struggle for the Armenian community to receive United Nations recognition of the genocide years after the massacres occurred. During the Candlelight Vigil at Storke Plaza there will be a moment of silence to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice. – Vice President of the Armenian Student Association Alexander Atamian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Vice President of the Armenian Student Association and third-year biology major Alexander Atamian described the event as a week of remembrance for the genocide, which he said occurred under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for eight years during the start of World War I.</p>\n<p>“Every year we have an Armenian Genocide commemoration week and it’s in order to remember the 1.5 million Armenians that were massacred in 1915 to 1923 by the Ottoman regime at the time,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Atamian said U.S. Senators oftentimes only say they will acknowledge the 1915 massacres as a genocide in order to gain political support from the Armenian community, and then often do not completely follow through.</p>\n<p>“At this point I believe it’s just a political and strategic tactic that senators are using in order to get all of the Armenian votes because they know how strongly Armenians feel about the situation,” Atamian said. “I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice.”</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, in order to prevent future genocides it is necessary for the global community to recognize all past genocides that have occurred, particularly the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“There are other genocides in the world that are happening every day and we need to step up morally and defend those who are being massacred,” Atamian said. “In order for there to not be future genocides we need to acknowledge and accept the ones that have occurred — the first one of the 20th century being the Armenian Genocide.”</p>\n<p>Atamian said ASA integrated other ethnic groups in their commemoration this year in acknowledgement that other groups were also massacred during the time of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“This year we did something different where we had a Assyrian individual approach us and asked us if we would also share their story as well in our commemoration, which we did … because during that time others were annihilated,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, as a part of the Armenian Genocide commemoration week, ASA put up a miniature version of the Armenian Genocide Memorial across from Storke to represent the 12 provinces that belonged to Armenia before the genocide occurred.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide. – Professor Paul Spickard</p></blockquote>\n<p>“[What] we started to do last year was put up the silver memorial along with the 12 slabs … it’s basically a miniature of the Armenian Genocide memorial that is in Yerevan, which is the capital of Armenia … the 12 slabs representing the 12 provinces that belonged to historical Armenia,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Paul Spickard, a professor who focuses on 20th-century U.S. social and cultural history, said although some historians disagree, most historians have come to a consensus that admits the Armenian Genocide fits the definition of a “genocide.”</p>\n<p>“The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide,” Spickard said. “That’s the consensus of historians but there are historians who disagree with that.”</p>\n<p>Spickard also said the Armenian Genocide fits the United Nations’ definition of genocide because it was a direct attempt to annihilate the Armenian population.</p>\n<p>“It was clearly ethnically directed and that’s one of the criteria for genocide,” Spickard said. “When the United Nations was founded they came up with a definition for genocide as an attack or attempt to destroy an entire ethnic group and it clearly was that.”</p>\n<p>According to Spickard, because the U.S. is an ally to Turkey and Turkey refuses to admit its past aggressions, the U.S. is in a difficult political situation in regard to identifying the 1915 massacre as a genocide.</p>\n<p>“Turkey is part of NATO, Turkey is one of the major players in Middle-Eastern politics and … of those players they are the only one with a democracy. So they are an ally,” Spickard said. “The United States really needs Turkey to be a strong counterbalance to Iran … [and] Turkey doesn’t want to face their reality.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year cultural anthropology major and member of cultural sorority Alpha Gamma Alpha Vicki Deirboghossian said many people outside of the Armenian community participated in the event “Handprint Against Genocide” on this past Tuesday to show their support for students advocated for Armenian genocide recognition.</p>\n<p>“At Handprints Against Genocide … from what I observed a lot of people that weren’t Armenian or weren’t associated [with ASA] actually did participate,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Deirboghossian said it is rewarding to see others at the university care about the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to see, being at a primarily white multicultural university and finding that people actually do care, it’s very rewarding,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Katrine Lalaian said it is important for students to be aware of the Armenian Genocide because after a century many people do not know it even occurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really important thing … since it’s our centennial and a lot of people don’t even know what it is,” Lalaian said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/","id":2799,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2798,2797,2796],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
