The spacious events center transformed into a large venue, providing both standing room and seating accommodations, yet most of the crowd were without a doubt drawn to the stage. Despite doors opening at 8:00 p.m., nearly two hours went by before the opening act, Tor Miller, took the stage. In most cases this would call for an uproar of anger from the crowd, but there were no hints of angst threatening to taint the atmosphere. Whether it was the feeling of being surrounded by peers who understood or the number of impaired people in the crowd, the night was too mystic to let impatience get in the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69614\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69614\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1497867743\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69608\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69614\" data-attachment-id=\"69614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/grouplove-warms-it-up-at-deltopia-show/grouplove-by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Grouplove by Lorenzo Basilio 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69614\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Just as the crowd seemed to be losing an ounce of hope, Tor Miller and band took the stage and set the tone for a night that would send everyone present through a spiral of emotions. He may have been a New York native, but the students at UCSB welcomed him with open arms. Although most people were not aware of who he was, he was captivating enough to keep their attention. His stage presence — along with the band members that surrounded him — allowed him to do so. Much to the crowd’s dismay, a portion of his set was a bit on the slower side, yet it enhanced the vitality of songs to follow when the songs did pick up the pace.</p>\n<p>Tor Miller was particularly enjoyable because of his ability to shift between various styles of sound. It is evident in his performance alone that he takes the risk of toying around with various genres instead of finding one that works and sticking with it. Every soulful, alluring song aided to the feeling of wanting to stay inside that room just a little longer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The room erupted in the weight of a thousand lights intensifying with every scream. It was apparent that the band was happy to be there, and the crowd only reciprocated the feeling. The connection between the band and the crowd was dynamic, and the rapport among the students alone was fascinating. The sublime unison could only be explained through the music that played in the background, and while getting lost in the moment, the realization came that this performance was something that only UCSB students had experienced. Rather than just simply seeing Grouplove do what they do best and calling it a night to remember, it became a night to remember because we were able to experience together.</p>\n<p>Grouplove’s energy, along with their artistry, is unequivocal. There is no questioning the fact that they brought a much needed revival to the campus after a long break. It was an extravagant night that one just had to be there to experience, especially with the performance of their hit single, “Tongue Tied.” Every bit of apprehension evaporated the further they went down the set list, and it would be an understatement to say that the school will miss them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

only Gnash is bringing his tour to Santa Barbara with support from friends Goody Grace and Julius on March 9, 7 PM at Velvet Jones. Gnash as an artist is particularly unique because he is able to create his own genre with such subtlety that there is no room for comparison. Many have debated the idea, but he neither identifies as a singer nor rapper, nor solely a DJ, but just as an artist. Attempting to label his creativity would be difficult, so if, for whatever reason, necessity called for a label, it would simply be “Gnash.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash, along with Goody Grace and Julius, is a Los Angeles local, and he is certainly not a stranger to the scene. Performing at shows with artists like Kehlani, Mod Sun and Blackbear, his fan base has expanded enormously over the last several years. He has been friends with these artists for some time, so it is not accurate to say that this is where his fan base originated from, but rather it helped him to become known to the people who had looked past him for some time. His first EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is crafted as a vivid representation of someone who has loved and lost, yet refuses to let it tear them down completely. This is a common theme throughout his early music, giving people an inside look at his heart and mind while also letting people know that is okay to feel something even when it feels like it can destroy you. Gnash’s latest EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, includes this similar truth, but it is much more lively. As he stated in an Instagram post immediately following the release of the EP, it includes many of the life lessons he has learned about moving on and being content with being alone, a healing that is completely evident between the lines of every track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash’s music is all about his journey, and it makes it easier to get to know him as a person. If his sounds are ever too difficult to follow (which is nearly impossible), then it is a joy to get to know his personality through the updates he provides for his “dreamers” via Twitter and Snapchat. His love for his fans shows through his constant hard work and interactions, and there is never a time in which you would second guess supporting him. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to experience Gnash’s music live comes around often, but it increases with intensity with each performance. His energy on stage is overwhelming, and his ability to adapt to any stage or fan base is what makes his performances so enjoyable. If someone is not familiar with his music, they will be sure to check him out after the show. For someone who has seen Gnash a number of times, I know for a fact that he will bring everything he has to the stage. Everything he does, he does it for the people that support him, and he is never quick to forget that his fans are the backbone of his success in addition to his worth ethic. Velvet Jones is a very intimate venue, so it will only enhance the Gnash experience. Getting to see Goody Grace and Julius (who are featured on several songs with Gnash) alongside him is going to make this show go down history. Santa Barbara will be raving about these Los Angeles natives for days, and the lucky ones will be able to say they were there to experience it.</span></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/gnash/ihateuiloveu</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

coming to Velvet Jones this Thursday, April 7. An authentic and self-described thug, Gibbs has been hustling his whole life, whether through rapping, dealing drugs or in a more literal sense playing D1 football. He has led a high-stakes and highly dramatic life and shows no signs of slowing down. Born Fredrick Tipton in eastside Gary, Indiana, Gibbs welcomed the street life early on. After getting kicked out of Ball State, his criminal motivation kicked into high gear. He has since been arrested for gun possession, drug dealing and robbery and has even worked as a pimp. In a more 1800s-style crime streak, Gibbs crossed over to the Wild Wild West outlaw realm as he began robbing freight trains. Rap pulled him out of this lifestyle briefly when he signed onto Interscope. This venture was short lived, and after it crumbled he returned to the lifestyle he was trying to escape. Eventually he returned to rap, putting out a staggering three albums, five mixtapes and seven EPs since 2010.</p>\n<p>While you would probably know him best from his recent song “Old English” or the Kanye remix “Cocaine Parties in LA,” his discography is as complex and extensive as his life. Whether it’s his gritty <em>Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik</em> (referencing Outkast’s <em>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</em>) or compilation mixtape <em>The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs</em>, Gibbs offers lyrically driven, all-too-real gangsta rap. His 2014 album <em>Piñata</em> was a collaborative album with producer Madlib which received widespread critical acclaim and earned him a spot on Pitchfork’s Top 50 Albums of the Year. Concertgoers should expect a lot of hits from this album and his most recent one, <em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>a trappier, heavier album that sounds more like his older mixtapes.</p>\n<p>In a world where everyone from the streets thinks he can rap and everybody who can rap thinks he’s from the streets, Gibbs demands the world realize a genuine street/rap crossover can still thrive. Whereas highly debatable lines like Drake’s “Started From The Bottom” make many people cringe, it doesn’t seem like much of a stretch when Gibbs refers to himself as “Gangsta Gibbs” or “Freddie Corleone.” As a man whose entourage has literally taken bullets for him, who has himself sold drugs and struggled with addiction, who has actually, seriously robbed a freight train, Gibbs has safely secured himself a position as a bona fide badass. One can only wonder how much more aggressive he’d be if he wasn’t smoking a reported half ounce of weed per day. This all being said, his show will provide an interesting perspective that most UCSB students cannot relate to while simultaneously blowing the fucking roof off of Velvet Jones with some of the most uninhibited, unapologetic rapping you’ve ever heard. Not a bad deal for $25.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

station that doubles as NPR during the day, you have likely heard one of the ultra-cool late-night DJs mention and/or play Quantic. Quantic’s unique blend of traditionally acoustic music styles (cumbia, salsa, jazz) with edgy, electronic experimentation creates the perfect ambience for cruising through L.A. at 2 a.m. Fortunately, it also makes for a rockin’ party. On Friday, April 1 the England-born, Columbia-taught, New York-based artist came to Santa Barbara to play at Velvet Jones.</p>\n<p>Opening first was Givers and Takers, a self-described “bliss-rock” band comprised of former Gauchos. Standing at the front of the stage, lead vocalist and keyboardist Zack Greenwald wore loose, colorful clothing and a blue-and-yellow scarf around his head. He looked as if someone had tie-dyed a Hare Krishna. Givers and Takers played a relatively smooth electronic set. Most of the time, the bliss-rock label was fitting, but the band often digressed into harder chords and vocals more representative of true rock than anything particularly indie or pop.</p>\n<p>Following Givers and Takers was Xenia Rubinos. Rubinos shares some of Quantic’s Caribbean influences, but blends these with soul, hip-hop and R&amp;B. She herself boasts a smoky, soulful voice that’s simultaneously playful, oddly reminiscent of Kate Nash. She also used the full extent of her physicality on stage. Rubinos extended her arms out, twining her fingers together. She beckoned the audience closer and gracefully twirled her arms. With her unique vocals and movement, the singer crafts a distinct and affecting stage presence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally, Quantic himself mounted the stage with his band. They all sported shirts with green and pink triangle patterns, the kind of design that would be at home on a dashiki. Quantic (aka Will Holland) maintained an unassuming stage presence. He never stood front and center, keeping slightly back and to the right, level with his drummer and saxophonist.</p>\n<p>All three members of the band pivoted between instruments. Quantic himself played guitar and accordion; percussionist Wilson Viveros played a drum set but also hopped out front at times to rapidly beat on a single drum; regular Quantic collaborator Sylvester Onyejiaka alternated between his sax, a keyboard and a flute that he piped notes out on. Together the band fuses Latin and Caribbean vibes with electronic twists. At some point Quantic pulled out his accordion and dove into cumbia, the dance-oriented, tropical-sounding genre popular in Latin America. Holding his accordion, Quantic bounced up and down on stage, smiling widely. Later, the band played a more melodic, melancholic song Quantic called “Time is the Enemy.” The lighting designer wisely chose to bathe the stage in dark blue light. Rather than lose the audience with this more somber tune, Quantic managed to captivate them. After quite a few minutes of this, the band reverted back to a lighter, more danceable tune.</p>\n<p>One fourth-year UCSB student, Tomek Buras, spoke with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about what drew him to Quantic.</p>\n<p>“I love the blend between the Latin and the Caribbean vibes, and I love the electronic fusion,” said Buras.</p>\n<p>Quantic is known for his preference for sharing the stage, and Friday night was no exception. L.A.-based collaborator Jimetta Rose repeatedly returned to the stage to invigorate the show. Rose exuded a formidable and exuberant presence, calling to the audience and fiercely belting out spirited lyrics. Rose embodies soul — she howls her words. At one point she implored the audience, “Tell the person next to you ‘you’re beautiful.’ We all need to hear those words, every single day.” A guy next to me said “you’re beautiful” and held out his fist to bump. I repeated the words and bumped him, not sure if what happened was a sincere exchange of genuine human affection or just a laugh. Maybe the performers do have a mystical sway in instilling a sense of free love and community into the audience through groovy Latin vibes. Certainly one elderly hippie lady (55 plus years old) seemed to believe so as she mounted the stage and swayed about, clearly drugged-out. Velvet Jones security did not share this communal euphoria. Drummer Wilson Viveros thought it was hilarious.</p>\n<p>Viveros as a musician is remarkable. The older Columbian man maintained a perpetually bemused look on his face as he plunged into several drum solos throughout the show, all done with lightning speed and precision.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his performance, Quantic played music from his most forthcoming album. The beats emanating from the speaker exhibited a harsher techno, but remained highly danceable.</p>\n<p>As his performance concluded, the audience began a chant of “Uno mas!” After a moment, Quantic came back up and spoke. “I’m afraid I’m done, due to Santa Barbara zoning laws — they’re searching people for drugs.” A moment passed. “April Fools” he said, smiling, 45 minutes into April 2 before coming back up with his band to play several mas.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/quantic-brings-latin-funk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6775,"author":{"id":407,"name":"Gabriel Lazo"},"related":[6774,6773,6772],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
