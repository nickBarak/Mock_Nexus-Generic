After a 51-48 comeback win against Dallas last Sunday, the team has shown that they have what it takes to win in the clutch after coasting to easy wins in weeks one through four. Granted, Tony “Choke-O” played his usual game of three brilliant quarters and an epic implosion, but it ultimately came down to an aging quarterback showing he still has a few tricks up his sleeve.</p>\n<p>At age 37, Peyton Manning continues to make jaws drop across the nation with his record-breaking passing numbers and game-to-game dominance. Two years removed from career-threatening neck surgery, Peyton is on track for about 6,000 yards and 60 touchdowns this season alone, putting him in contention for the most coveted title in sports, “Greatest Quarterback of All Time.”</p>\n<p>In the game against the Cowboys, Peyton recorded his 20th TD of the year and threw his first interception. He even ran for a touchdown on an improvised bootleg that he declined to tell his teammates and coaches about.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Broncos aren’t just about Manning though. Demaryius Thomas is playing as well as any wide receiver in football right now, and would have even gaudier numbers if not for Wes Welker and Eric Decker sharing targets. Consider first-year starter Julius Thomas emerging as the best tight end in football not named Jimmy Graham, and Denver has the best four pass-catchers that we’ve seen in recent memory … maybe ever.</p>\n<p>The three-headed mini-monster of Knowshon Moreno, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman are more than serviceable in a pass-heavy NFL, considering the New Orleans Saints, Green Bay Packers and New York Giants all won the Super Bowl in the last five years with less firepower out of the backfield. They each provide something unique and valuable to the team, with Moreno being the workhorse and pass-blocker, Ball being the goal-line threat and power back and Hillman providing quickness and an explosive playmaking element. Moreno in particular is having the career-year everyone has been waiting for, averaging over five yards per carry with defenses sagging off to protect against the dangerous pass attack.</p>\n<p>Granted, the defense gives up a ton of passing yards, but this is only because opponents are usually down by multiple touchdowns in the first quarter and throw like mad in an attempt to play catch-up. When it comes down to it, cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie are talented enough to make big plays in the outside, and the return of linebacker Von Miller gives Denver a much-needed playmaking pass-rusher.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Denver is first in the NFL in yards allowed against the run, although, on paper, their interior defensive line and linebackers might be considered a weakness. Their dynamic passing offense covers up this chink in the armor, as the numbers show.</p>\n<p>The last team to make an honest attempt at going undefeated was the 2009 Indianapolis Colts. They won the first 14 games of the regular season and might have gone undefeated if not for resting their starters in the final two games. The quarterback of that historic team: Peyton Manning. Now, in the last few years of his career, maybe Peyton will decide to go out, play 16 weeks of world-class football and make a run at history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared

Usual playoff contenders such as the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers are winless, while some usual cellar dwellers such as the Miami Dolphins are finding ways to win. Perhaps the most surprising start this season has been the resurgence of the Kansas City Chiefs under new Head Coach Andy Reid. Sparked by a stellar defense, the Chiefs look like they may be in contention for a playoff spot in the AFC.</p>\n<p>While it would take a miracle for the Chiefs to surpass the high-powered Denver Broncos, Kansas City certainly looks capable of securing a wild card spot, especially with a 4-0 record already on the season. When examining the schedule, naysayers may note that the Chiefs have yet to beat any team of merit this season, but at times, the Chiefs look straight up dominant.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City, it all starts on the defensive end. The Chiefs lead the NFL in points allowed, surrendering just over 10 points per game. To put that in perspective, if the Chiefs were to maintain that average the entire season, they would narrowly edge out the 2000 Ravens for fewest points allowed in a 16-game season. While that mark is almost undoubtedly sure to rise for KC, there is still no denying the fact that its defense has been a revelation this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Third-year outside linebacker Justin Houston started the year on fire, registering an NFL high 7.5 sacks this season and almost equaling his career-high 10-sack mark he set during last season’s Pro Bowl campaign. Houston may not be able to keep up the same sack pace this season, but he certainly looks like he is capable of registering 15-plus sacks on the season for the Chiefs’ solid front seven, which leads the NFL with 18 sacks this season.</p>\n<p>The strength of the Chiefs’ defense certainly seems to be its linebacking corps. Houston and veterans Tamba Hali and Derrick Johnson form an intimidating trio to go along with a solid fourth linebacker in Akeem Jordan, who is usually pulled when the team switches from its base 3-4 defense to a nickel to defend the pass.</p>\n<p>Hali and Houston provide tremendous quarterback pressure from the edges while Johnson is a more do-it-all type of linebacker, as evidenced by his three-straight 100-plus tackle seasons. The defensive line may not add a whole lot, aside from nose tackle Dontari Poe, who has 3.5 sacks this season, but the Chiefs’ front seven has the looks of a young but promising defense.</p>\n<p>Kansas City’s secondary, meanwhile, has put up extremely strong numbers to start the season, allowing fewer than 190 passing yards per game this season. Much of that success can be attributed to the pressure the front seven has managed to place on opposing quarterbacks, but the secondary deserves similar credit as well. Headlined by safety Eric Berry, this young and aggressive secondary has proven capable of shutting down high-powered passing attacks such as the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles.</p>\n<p>With the eldest starting defensive back (Brandon Flowers) at 27 years old, this Chiefs’ secondary certainly has shown it is willing to grow together and become one of the more consistent and dangerous units in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Andy Reid has revitalized this Chiefs franchise into a legitimate playoff contender in just one year and deserves much of the credit due to his leadership style. Sure, the Chiefs could flame out similar to last season’s Arizona Cardinals, but this Kansas City team has the looks of a playoff team with a strong defense to go along with a veteran quarterback who has many dangerous offensive weapons at his disposal.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing the Chiefs have on the offensive side of the ball, it is speed. Running back Jamaal Charles is arguably the fastest back in the NFL, and he has proven dangerous in both the running and passing game throughout his career. Wide receivers Donnie Avery and Dexter McCluster also possess that breakaway speed that allows the Chiefs to stretch the field, while Dwayne Bowe is the big target over the middle for Alex Smith.</p>\n<p>Smith may not have felt the love in San Francisco, but he is doing a fine job finding his weapons in the open field and staying efficient in the process. His 7:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio is amongst the best in the league, and Smith has continually proven dangerous with his arm and legs, tools that constantly allow him to avoid pressure from opposing defenses. Smith may not be a quarterback that can lead the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, but he is a veteran and is off to a great start this season.</p>\n<p>Look for the Chiefs to continue winning games this season and to at least challenge Denver’s clinching of the AFC West by Week 12 of the season. I’m predicting an 11-win season for a Chiefs team that finished last season with the worst record in the NFL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fantasy Football</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, it has been a tough start in fantasy football for me this season. Some of the guys I thought were going to have really big years (C.J. Spiller in particular) have gotten off to slow starts. Nonetheless, my team is surviving through injuries to Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski and Roddy White, so I’m still holding out hope.</p>\n<p>However, along with the struggling veterans come exciting breakout players that have been fantasy all-starts throughout the first four weeks. Here are my fantasy breakout stars of the first quarter of the NFL season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Quarterback: Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers</p>\n<p>As weird as it is to say, Rivers has been one of the better quarterbacks to start this 2013 season. Only Peyton Manning tops his 11:2 touchdown to interception ratio, and Rivers ranks second in the league behind only Manning in quarterback rating as well. Rivers is finding ways to put the ball in the end zone and avoid the costly turnovers fans have come to expect from him. He is a solid starting quarterback option any time he takes the field, and with matchups against Oakland and Jacksonville looming in weeks five and seven, there is no better time to ride the hot hand with Rivers than now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Running Back: Reggie Bush, Detroit Lions</p>\n<p>Bush is finally showing why he was so highly prized coming out of USC eight years ago. While he was reliable the last two seasons while in Miami, Bush has proven deadly thus far in Detroit. Matthew Stafford gets him the ball regularly out of the backfield, and Bush is perhaps the biggest dual-threat back this season in terms of both rushing and receiving. If he can stay healthy, Bush will continue to be a focal point of the Lions’ offensive attack and rack up a monster fantasy season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wide Receiver: Pierre Garçon, Washington Redskins</p>\n<p>There may have been better breakout options than Garçon at the wideout position, but you can’t argue the type of year he is having. Garçon has recorded at least six receptions in all four games this season and looks like the most dangerous weapon that Robert Griffin III has at his disposal. If the Redskins can get back to any of the same offensive production they had last season, Garçon will continue to build upon his already promising year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tight End: Jordan Cameron, Cleveland Browns</p>\n<p>Anyone who drafted and started Cameron this season knows they potentially picked up the biggest steal of the season. While he has cracked 100 receiving yards only once this season, Cameron already has five touchdown receptions and has scored 15 or more points in three of four weeks. Despite the Browns’ quarterback deficiencies, Cameron will remain a threat in the red zone, thus racking up touchdowns for the rest of the year. He has been a stud at the tight end position this season, rivaled only by Jimmy Graham in terms of consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Defense: Kansas City Chiefs</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have posted 20-point fantasy performances three times this season and look like a top-tier option and must-add for any owner. Add their league-leading 18 sacks to five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries and it is no wonder the Chiefs’ defense is lighting it up on a weekly basis. Keep in mind they also get to play the Raiders twice this season, so expect them to continue to put up great numbers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52248\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52248\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/","id":3226,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3225,3224,3223],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The WNBA’s Michael Jordan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DT-sports.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DT-sports.jpg?resize=300%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Diana Taurasi: The best player to ever play the women's game","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One of the most common questions surrounding the women’s game today is when it will find its Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>Then come the follow-up questions. What will she look like? Where did she go to school? What team will she play for?</p>\n<p>In reality, people should put these questions to rest and search no further because the best player in the women’s game is already playing.</p>\n<p>She wears No. 3 for the Phoenix Mercury, choosing the number as a freshman at UConn when college coach Geno Auriemma told her she could be the Babe Ruth of women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>He was right.</p>\n<p>After winning two NCAA titles, the UConn legend went on to win two WNBA championships, five scoring titles and two Olympic gold medals. Averaging 20.6 points per game on her career, she’s also an eight time all-star, tying Lisa Leslie for the most appearances in league history.</p>\n<p>Based on those clues, if you still don’t know who I’m referring to, this one of a kind player is Diana Taurasi.</p>\n<p>Like Mike, Taurasi makes her teammates better while knowing when to put the team on her back. She’s not only their vocal leader, but a lead by example kind of player. This season, she averaged 20.2 points and 6.2 assists per game. Last season, the only players in the NBA to accomplish these kinds of numbers were LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook and Stephan Curry. And they did it in 48 minutes; Taurasi only gets 40.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, one of the reasons that Taurasi is the WNBA’s Jordan is that she plays more like a guy. You can actually compare her. She can shoot threes from NBA range, and often does. She loves contact when driving inside and has incredible hang time for a woman.</p>\n<p>Beyond her play though, Taurasi has the mentality of a man. While she would do anything for the team, she certainly has an ego. Her fiery personality often leads to arguments with referees, which adds to her entertainment value. When you watch ‘Dee,’ you look for her to get T’d up because when she does, it usually means she’s going to go on a scoring tangent.</p>\n<p>But despite the fact that there is typically one player believed to be the best ever, there is never one player that will always be the best. Deciding the top player in any league is always controversial and there will always be a better player that comes along. Jordan is the best NBA player to play in the modern era, but there will be another, just like before Jordan there was Dr. J and Wilt Chamberlain.</p>\n<p>The game of basketball is constantly evolving and as a result, it’s impossible to compare players from different time periods. So, Taurasi is the best right now, but at some point in time, there will be a next best women’s player to play the game. She won’t necessarily be better than Taurasi when compared to the time she plays in, but the game will have grown and changed its style.</p>\n<p>Another comparison that can’t be made in the sport of basketball is men to women. Taurasi has a more masculine style of play, which allows the comparison, but overall, the men and women’s game are too different. When the women find its best player ever, like Jordan is considered, nobody will be saying that she’s the women’s version of Jordan.</p>\n<p>While basketball is basketball, men and women play extremely different styles, the men being more athletic and the women playing a more strategic, finesse game.</p>\n<p>So, when that best player ever arises for the women, you’ll know it because there will be no comparison to the men. The game will have reached the point where women will be respected.</p>\n<p>You’ll simply hear, “That’s _________ and she’s the best player to ever play the women’s game.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of wnba.com</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52308\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52308\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/","id":3227,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3226,3225,3224],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
