There was also a crew of juveniles serving out its court-mandated community service hours for the day. The poor suckers had to dig a massive sand pit for an obstacle course the kids used at lunch. I guess not everyone was a volunteer.</p>\n<p>We unloaded trailers full of custom surfboards — some were 18-feet-long with customized wheelchair mounts for handicapped riders — and heaps of wetsuits, lifeguarding surfboards, double-wide boogie boards and heaps of other fine-tuned surf equipment for children with special needs.</p>\n<p>The kids varied in their capabilities and disabilities. Several had developmental disabilities, while several more seemed to have some cognitive impairments, were blind or deaf, battling cancer or phasing out of chemo.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t believe the bravery of those children. Even to someone who has spent his life around it, the ocean is gigantic and unpredictable. And for those kids — some of whom couldn’t even see, some who couldn’t speak, some who had probably never set foot in the ocean and/or demonstrated problems attaining full ranges of physical motion — the sea must’ve been incomprehensible and terrifying at first.</p>\n<p>Trying to steer a surfboard that’s twice or three times the size of your regular board while a newbie surfer perches in front of you is not easy. Not at all. Luckily, the crew of talented volunteers in the water and on the beach were there exclusively to help the kids surf.  We, the volunteers, were their eyes, ears, voices and extra limbs in the water. Every child was assigned to a team of surfers, several of whom would wade or swim next to the child, while one surfer on the extra-sized surfboard rode the wave with the child and stabilized the ride.</p>\n<p>The majority of the time I helped kids onto surfboards and kept close watch to make sure that each child was safe. One particularly striking moment was when this little autistic tyke named Jack, who I was shepherding around the beach, lost his balance and tumbled into my arms. Luckily, the tide was low and I had my feet planted on the bottom so I could hold Jack, but I was completely submerged while I walked to shore holding him over my head above water level. While we didn’t actually speak to each other (Jack wasn’t able to fully articulate coherent speech as part of his autism) the desperate hug that little guy gave me as I carried him to shore before venturing out in the water with him to try again said it all.</p>\n<p>That day, I helped a child without vision stand poised on a surfboard, beaming with all of his face as spray kicked into it. I helped a pack of kids feel, for their first time, the surge of adrenaline that accompanies the tossing and vibrancy of the ocean. I felt the delight of all the volunteers with me firsthand and reveled in our camaraderie, our shared drive to pass our stoke on to those less fortunate.</p>\n<p>It was probably the best day of my life. I state that confidently, without hubris. Not ironically, one of the volunteer organizations participating that October day is named the Best Day Foundation for its efforts.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of my weeklies end along the lighthearted lines of “Go surfing, it’s good for you.” However, sometimes it’s just not that simple. Going surfing isn’t always an easy prospect to tackle.  When you are confronted by special needs such as health conditions, the idea of setting foot in the ocean can seem like a distant hope. That’s why organizations like Ride a Wave and Best Day are crucial. As a volunteer for these philanthropies, you are these children’s natural crutch to lean on.</p>\n<p>I hope those kids remember that day for the rest of their lives. I also hope everyone who reads this takes the time to visit bestdayfoundation.org and rideawave.org to learn how they can contribute to the joy helping others surf. Both organizations have extended their philanthropic efforts nationally. Regardless of skill level, volunteers are needed to expand their efforts further.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

to speak about her experience as Secretary of State and her take on foreign policy, among other things.</p>\n<p>Albright explained that her father faced roadblocks seeking political asylum in the U.S. during the McCarthy Era, as he had to explain that the government he once worked under was openly communist. This extreme governmental scrutiny delayed a young Albright’s path to citizenship until the summer between her sophomore and junior years at Wellesley College.</p>\n<p>Albright expressed the importance of written immigration policy –– an issue that currently divides the executive and legislative branches in a record-breaking government shutdown.</p>\n<p>“We could be more generous in our laws…We have a lot of room [in the country],” she said to a room of thunderous applause.</p>\n<p>She expressed support and empathy for those supported by the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAMers), noting that the bartering of their livelihoods are a “particularly sad aspect” of the immigration crisis.</p>\n<p>“We have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep,” she said during the speech.</p>\n<p>Albright also praised UC Santa Barbara for being one of the first universities to offer a Global Studies major. Though she expressed her concerns for the current state of American foreign policy –– and emphasized that the rest of the world would not wait for the United States to get its act together –– she remained optimistic that students at the university would learn to think beyond stereotypes and borders.</p>\n<p>Albright praised students who opted to study abroad or those whose majors contain an emphasis on the relationship between culture and ethics.</p>\n<p>“Seeds nourished in a multicultural classroom have a way of blossoming… This is a key to real leadership.”</p>\n<p>A common theme in Albright’s talk was a sense of prevailing hope for the future. Citing a round-table discussion earlier in the day with members of the UCSB Letters &amp; Science Honors Program, she spoke with delight about the ferocity of the students she had conversed with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She cited weakness at the core of the political system, not only with the downfall of the American presidency, but with the disastrous Brexit deal as well. The fall of democracy, she claimed, allows fascism to creep its way back into the public eye.</p>\n<p>“As the world’s democracies dither, [nationalist movements] scale the ramparts,” she said, referencing rising totalitarian states like Russia, Syria, Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>\n<p>This rising hyper-nationalism is caused by a combination of globalization and technology, Albright added: “[These trends] are double-edged swords.”</p>\n<p>The issue with globalization, she said, is that it is faceless. She views technology as a more difficult issue to unpack, as she believes it has caused much beneficial change, but also noted that it has put so many skilled laborers out of work.</p>\n<p>Social media combines these two factors, and in the hands of demagogues, becomes a tool of unwieldy fascism, Albright said. She claims social media “allows demagogues to build bonfires” out of hatred, and with the technological advancements of a worldwide platform, the spread of fascism has become that much simpler.</p>\n<p>When asked by moderator Jeff Greenfield how she explains the behavior of President Trump to foreigners, Albright became visibly restrained.</p>\n<p>“I find it very, very painful…There is no logic. It is confusing to our allies as well as our adversaries.”</p>\n<p>Yet, Albright wholeheartedly encouraged people to run for office and to engage in dialogues across the aisle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the word tolerance,” she said, claiming instead that she is partial to its friendlier counterpart ‘respect.’</p>\n<p>She referenced her morning commute to Georgetown University, driving through the streets of Washington, D.C. as she listens to right wing radio. Though it may cause her to, as she puts it, “pose a certain risk to pedestrians,” she also said it was beneficial for her bipartisan philosophy to gain a deeper understanding of both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>“Although now confused for an eccentric Uber driver, I was once Secretary of State.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85780\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright-shares-optimism-at-granada-theatre/eveningwithma-22012019-angelicabanks-9/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-85780\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85780\" data-attachment-id=\"85780\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright-shares-optimism-at-granada-theatre/eveningwithma-22012019-angelicabanks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks–9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85780\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EveningwithMA-22012019-AngelicaBanks-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>There were approximately a 100 people in attendance; some, such as UCSB second-year political science and global studies double major Alex Young, were impressed with Albright’s visit to the Granada.</p>\n<p>However, Young said he was disappointed that she showed restraint when speaking about current political affairs.</p>\n<p>“I think Secretary Albright has a really interesting history and has done great work…a lot other answers were really indirect but I respect her for staying neutral in domestic affairs and speaking to changes on the international stage.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and French double major Emma Wiley was one of the few honors students present during Albright’s roundtable discussion earlier in the day with UCSB students. She agreed that Albright was far more restrained during her prepared remarks.</p>\n<p>“You can tell that she genuinely feels passion for the United States,” Wiley added.</p>\n<p>Not all were happy with Albright’s visit to the Granada, however. A handful of protestors — including approximately 20 members of the Student Activist Network and the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective — stood outside the building during Albright’s speech chanting, “Whose streets?” “Our streets!” and “Whose blood?” “Albright’s blood!”</p>\n<p>Protesters held signs with slogans such as: “Albright gave the green light for the Rwandan Genocide” and “No war mongers in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>In a statement referring to Albright as “a neo-imperialist hawk widely accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity,” the Student Activist Network encouraged UCSB to “redirect its resources to public figures committed to transforming the unjust and untenable political and economic order that Former Secretary of State Albright exemplifies.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that she has written a book about resisting fascism is incredibly ironic because she paved the way for the rise of fascism in this country and in many other countries that the United States supported during her time in office,” Prathik Raghu, one of the organizers of the protest, said.</p>\n<p>Though Raghu, a teaching assistant within the UCSB Global Studies Department, sees Albright as an adversary to President Trump, this does not mean that this exonerates her from “having blood on her hands.”</p>\n<p><em>Hannah Jackson is an asst. opinion editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at opinion@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

He or she can rattle off equations or quote classics and has poured over textbooks in the library for four solid years. That model works for a lot of people, but not everyone.</p>\n<p>Education should not be confined to the mind. A big part of a happy or successful existence for many of us includes physical activity. While we’re here, the goal is to evolve a bit into more responsible, ready-for-real-life adults, and that’s why it is UCSB’s responsibility to provide physical education for all of us in addition to the classrooms and exams.</p>\n<p>Going back to my personal experience (I had to talk about myself at some point, right?), I have been a much happier person while leading a somewhat active lifestyle. Of course, many other factors in my life contribute to that happiness, but ESS, when I go, is basically a guarantee of a pretty good day.</p>\n<p>After exercising, I go home, shower, eat something and feel like I’m ready to get things done. Even if my muscles are a little sore and I’m physically tired, it never affects schoolwork, when I do it of course. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Playing a few sets of tennis or anything else stimulates my mind and improves my mood a ton. Something about endorphins, or something.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to ask yourself what class you went to last that made you feel better rather than exhausted. If the response is your 14-hour chem lab every Thursday night, then maybe the academics-driven lifestyle I talked about earlier is for you. That’s wonderful. We need people in those great white lab coats anyway.</p>\n<p>But if your answer is the same “umm… nothing” that I would have given last quarter, maybe it’s time to look somewhere else, and ESS is a great place to start. They offer a fucking sailing class for God’s sake! I know you have your second pass time coming up soon, so take up another half unit. It’s pass/no pass and, in my experience, they’re easy to crash.</p>\n<p>After four years of college, I’m starting to see why older people are always telling me to enjoy my time in college, to do every activity I can sign up for. It goes by fast, and I highly suggest you find room in between booty calls and film screenings to pick up a sport or two, even if you suck. ESS is going to be gone very soon so find a class now, because it’s the last chance you’re going to get, and that’s a shame.
