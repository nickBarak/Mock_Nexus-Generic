id=\"caption-attachment-86267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The theater troupe spent weeks before the event tabling in the Arbor and inviting students to attend the show. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe President, Jalia Carlton-Carew, said auditions and initial preparations for the production began mid-Fall Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though these pieces are from the ‘90s, they still hold truth because they were still pieces inspired by people’s lived experiences at that time,” Carlton-Carew, a third-year film and media studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The casting process produced an array of people who could accurately portray the stories in “The Vagina Monologues,” according to Carlton-Carew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we have random people who just saw the show, like maybe the year before… I was just so interested after watching the show my first year that I knew I had to be a part of it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Carlton-Carew handles most of the logistics of the production, she will also be performing a self-written Herstory entitled “When I Was Seven,” in which she discusses her personal experience of black femininity in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really important culturally for people to be aware of all the topics that we talk about because they play into a wide range of stories… Pieces from the original monologues still relate today,” Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe Vice President, Kate Rossb, said she was inspired to become part of the production when she first saw the show her freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, [the show is] about people. We do target the female experience, but we also target nonbinary folk,” Ross said. “A lot of our pieces reflect cisgender women and trans women — a real variety of people and diverse experiences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of a wide range of speakers, characters and actors makes “The Vagina Monologues” and Herstories influential on a college campus such as UCSB, Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a special quality about seeing familiar faces on stage performing, Ross noted, saying that one of the ways in which the monologues succeed is in their ability to portray a spectrum of perspectives through real and relatable people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easier to distance yourself when it’s someone else’s words coming out of people’s mouths, but when you’re seeing someone up there, telling their story, and they’re your peers or it’s your sister or your friend or your friend’s friend, it definitely connects you more [to the story],” Ross said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Vagina Monologues” also provide an space for open discussions about current political and social dilemmas. This is one of the most important contributions “The Vagina Monologues” makes to the community, Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given our political climate now, you can’t afford to say something is ‘not your problem,’ even if it doesn’t pertain to you directly because the world is so interconnected. You will feel some impact based on that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if you aren’t influenced by people’s stories and what they’re performing, it’s still good to be educated about what other people’s experiences are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Monologues often deal with issues faced by students at university and reveal insights about students’ experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day,” Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After months of preparation and refining, Carew, Ross and the rest of the UCSB Women’s Theatre Troupe will finally showcase the production this weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the show’s earnings will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, an organization that provides confidential counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault and their loved ones, and the One Billion Rising Campaign, a global movement that aims to end rape and sexual violence against women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In anticipation for the production, Ross is looking forward to finally seeing the pieces come to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing everyone perform their pieces is really inspiring. It really warms my heart to see how much passion everyone is bringing to their stories.”</span></p>\n<p>Tickets can be purchased at the Associated Students ticket office.</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

We let everybody write their message, so that way once it’s delivered it’s already handwritten.”</p>\n<p>The idea to sell Valentine’s day grams started as a group project for Congdon’s Principles of Marketing class, TMP 124, where he and his group members had to construct a pop-up shop.</p>\n<p>After learning the project was due in February, Congdon’s group quickly realized that selling sex toys as part of a Valentine’s day pop-up could actually work, after previously tossing the idea around as a joke.</p>\n<p>“A friend in my group joked about it because her boyfriend’s dad actually owns a sex shop company so we could get wholesale prices,” Congdon said. “It was due in February, and we were like, what’s around February? Valentine’s day!” Congdon said.</p>\n<p>Congdon said the group project had only one rule: The shop couldn’t sell anything illegal.</p>\n<p>Shortly after realizing their idea could become a reality, Congdon, along with group members Clarissa Requiestas, Francesca Towers, Tommy Cen and Raymond Quan, began to map out the logistics of their project.</p>\n<p>Congdon found that the best approach for attracting customers would be to advertise on sites such as Facebook, where he could reach a large audience but also spare interested students the shame of walking into a brick-and-mortar sex shop.</p>\n<p>“We thought people might buy it for themselves. This is the perfect front to do it. It kinda, like, demystifies it. Like, ‘Oh, it’s a joke for a friend.’ If they wanted, they can gift themselves and not tell anybody.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of their buyers’ motivations, Congdon considered the Valentine’s Day grams a success, noting that his group sold over 80 grams before closing up shop.</p>\n<p>The grams are no longer being sold, as the due date for the project fell before Valentine’s Day.</p>\n<p>However, as part of the pop-up shop, Congdon and his group pledged to donate 5 percent of their proceeds to the Planned Parenthood California Central Coast.</p>\n<p>”It’s another way you can feel good about about buying a product for a good cause.
