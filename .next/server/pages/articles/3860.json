Right?\nFriday, Oct. 26, 1:53 a.m. - An officer observed a woman staggering from side to side, westbound on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem… Right?<br>\nFriday, Oct. 26, 1:53 a.m. – An officer observed a woman staggering from side to side, westbound on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The subject stumbled up a short embankment to a residence, where she diligently attempted to sit on a picnic bench, and unfortunately fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>Not one to succumb to failure on the first attempt, the woman stood back up and, this time, pulled off a perfect plop onto the picnic table.</p>\n<p>When a deputy approached the woman, she preempted his probing and proclaimed, “I know, I know. I’m fine. I’ve had four shots, but I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>When the officer managed to get a word in edgewise, he asked the subject where she lived and the 20-year-old woman replied, “I live a lot of places.”</p>\n<p>In his report, the officer noted as evidence of the subject’s extreme intoxication that her tan dress was disheveled and her top was open, nearly exposing her breasts.</p>\n<p>Evidently, the reporting deputy did not understand the Isla Vista Halloween dress code.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Out of Her League<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:04 p.m. – On the 6700 block of Trigo Road, a deputy observed a woman wearing a Washington Wizards jersey charge into a group of people and lose her balance.</p>\n<p>The woman, apparently incised over the foul, turned around and yelled at the group and continued traveling down the lane.</p>\n<p>That is, until an Isla Vista referee stopped her in her tracks. Noticing a strong odor of alcohol, an officer stopped the woman and took her out of the game.</p>\n<p>The deputy sat the woman on the curb and began questioning her, only to learn that she was 17 years old.</p>\n<p>The officer informed the player that she was too young to drink alcohol, to which she countered, “Yeah, but it is Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The rules of the game are the same everywhere, and the deputy said he thought the Wizard had too much to drink. The subject shot back, “Yeah, but so has everyone else.”</p>\n<p>This defense did not work, and the officer asked if the woman had any friends who could help her home. The subject said she drove to I.V. with her sister, but when the officers asked where her teammate was, the woman said, “I don’t know, she walked away from me.”</p>\n<p>This was then game over for the underage Wizard, who was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I’m the Baby… Gotta Love Me<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:28 p.m. –  Officers watched a 300 pound wearing a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth being  escorted down Camino Corto by a friend.</p>\n<p>An officer who observed the man noted that he was filthy and said it appeared that the big baby had fallen into a pile of dirt and rolled around in it.</p>\n<p>After watching the man stumble away from his friend and bounce into a parked car, a deputy stopped the duo and began questioning the 19-year-old man.</p>\n<p>The troubled toddler started whining to the deputies, repeating that he was not drunk, despite his inability to stand on his own, which the officers decided not to attribute to his infantile alter ego.</p>\n<p>The man had no identification and no money for a cab to transport him to his home downtown. The man would not tell officers how old he was  and refused to hold up the appropriate number of fingers. The man was drooling, slurring words and leaning against the patrol unit to keep from falling down.</p>\n<p>Officers arrested the childish culprit and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he took a nap.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Conference on Saturday at the church’s State Street location to provide engaging workshops for middle and high school-age LGBTQ youth and their families.</p>\n<p>The free conference, which ran from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., included a variety of workshops for both children and their parents. The parent workshops included a mental health forum led by two clinicians, a panel on LGBTQ youth health and a PFLAG, previously known as Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, discussion on how to be a supportive ally for LGBTQ youth. The youth workshops included a sexual education discussion, a college panel on identity expression and a series of “coming out” monologues. There was also a tutorial on “dragging” and a drag performance closed the conference.</p>\n<p>Reverend Alyssa De Wolf said attendees of all ages were able to benefit from the conference, particularly parents of LGBTQ youth.</p>\n<p>“I think the parents especially had a lot of time to meet other adults and other people who are working with LGBTQ students and I think got a lot of extra resources today too,” De Wolf said. “We’re trying to really strengthen not just the kids, but really strengthen the people who are working with kids so that we can be a better and stronger community.”</p>\n<p>De Wolf said she hopes the church’s future LGBTQ Youth Conferences will be longer and feature more speakers.</p>\n<p>“My vision is that it grows and grows,” De Wolf said. “I envision bringing in bigger speakers, more people, doing it maybe even more than one day, but really getting the word out and making it the sort of thing people come to every year and that kids especially get excited about every year.”</p>\n<p>Drag performer and 2012 Santa Barbara Queen of Pride Deja Re said she hoped kids left the conference feeling sure of their environment.</p>\n<p>“I think them having this safe place to go to and to really express themselves is great,” Re said. “It’s so great to see these kids at such a young age really know who they are and who they want to be.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she learned from people sharing their experiences of coming out to their friends and families.</p>\n<p>“I really liked sitting in on the ‘coming out’ panel,” Tranner said. “It was just people discussing their experiences coming out, and some of the issues and joys of coming out and that was really interesting to hear, especially from people younger than me.”</p>\n<p>Director of the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network Rachel Gloger said she hopes LGBTQ youth can feel physically and mentally safe and fully accept their identities.</p>\n<p>“The more safe spaces we can provide for these kids, the stronger their sense of community will be and the stronger their mental health outcomes are,” Gloger said. “I think the outcome of these events is just letting our town know that we have a lot of LGBT kids that we’re really proud of, and we’re proud to support them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fearing for the woman’s safety, an officer detained the man and began questioning him.</p>\n<p>The man was aggravated and began yelling that the officer was harassing him. The officer tried to ask the subject why he refused to leave the woman alone, but the man only responded by calling the officer a “douche bag” and saying he was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subject’s friends urged the man to behave, but he went on a rant, and said he wished the deputy would lose his job, and demanded his badge number.</p>\n<p>The man was obviously wasted, and was placed under arrest for public intoxication.

All [that space] is just free parking that anyone has a right to.”</p>\n<p>Ober said that because more people are commuting via bike, there will be more parking spaces available.</p>\n<p>“Every day that I ride a bike instead of drive, there’s going to be one more parking space — one more precious, beautiful, asphalt parking space — just waiting,” Ober said. “I think once the emotions settle, people will realize making biking more accessible and safe will result in additional parking.”</p>\n<p>Joey Juhasz-Lukomski, operations manager for the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, said it is “so valuable” to have a complete and connected bike pathway.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s going to encourage more people to ride their bikes,” Juhasz-Lukomski said. “That’s going to be more people biking downtown, which could actually free up more parking spaces because there will be less people driving downtown.”</p>\n<p>Omar Uribe, Santa Barbara City College student, said he is looking forward to safer bike travel after the Master Plan is implemented.</p>\n<p>“As a bicyclist, I know that [Micheltorena] has no bike lanes,” Uribe said. “I’ve been close to getting hit a couple times, and I’ve seen people get hit on that street.”</p>\n<p>Ober said bicycle safety should be a primary concern for the Council when considering the Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of motorists get passionate about parking or keeping streets for cars, but for them, it’s a convenience issue,” Ober said. “For cyclists, it’s a safety issue. It’s life and death.”</p>\n<p>Ober said his time spent on UCSB’s campus helped him discover the efficiency of biking.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is a lovely place to discover cycling as a practical way of getting around,” Ober said. “I lived on 6800 block of DP [Del Playa Drive]. I also lived on Phelps [Road] which is out by Costco. It taught me that it is way faster to ride a bike to get to class.”</p>\n<p>Tiffany Wu, second-year economics and accounting major chair of the A.S. Bicycle Committee, said she is pleased with the Council’s decision.</p>\n<p>“I’m really glad they passed it because it’s more sustainable and a lot safer for students because we are part of the community as well,” Wu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/downtown-bike-plan-approved/","id":3859,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[3858,3857,3856],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
