Coming off a 79-62 loss to Ohio University, NIU heads into Mandalay Bay Center with a respective record of 21-12 overall and 9-9 in the MAC.</p>\n<p>Winners of nine-straight before its semifinal loss in Anaheim, UCSB has proven itself as a team capable of finishing strong. Moreover, Santa Barbara has found its spark offensively in the month of March, shooting 48.5 percent from the floor and outscoring opponents by 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the opening round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara shot 54 percent and went 11-23 from the three-point line in a 26-point victory (87-61) against UC Davis. This matched UCSB’s largest margin of victory against a conference opponent this year.</p>\n<p>While their offensive efficiency has been a concern for opposing teams, the Gauchos’ strong play can also be accredited to a pestering defense that is currently +7 in the turnover margin and averaging 15 or more points off turnovers over a four-game stretch.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Eric Childress has become a vital contributor to this tenacious defense recording a career-high six steals, four in the first twenty minutes of play, in Santa Barbara’s loss to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>With solid performances on both ends of the court, Santa Barbara’s second unit has relieved some pressure in tight situations and been an aid in closing out games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have increased their bench production to nearly half of the team’s total points, 30.3, during this month. While coming up short in their last game, the second unit of UCSB outscored the Warriors’ bench 26-14 commanded by forward Alex Hart. The second year player out of British Columbia, Canada had his best performance yet scoring 13 points in nine minutes of play, trimming a 21-point Hawaii advantage to eight in the second half.</p>\n<p>This mixture of hard-nosed defense, streaky shooting, and bench support will be key ingredients for Head Coach Bob Williams and his team heading into their match against NIU.</p>\n<p>As for fifth year Head Coach Mark Montgomery and his Northern Illinois Huskies, they will rely on a talented core of underclassmen to propel their way to victory. A starting lineup that features two freshmen and one sophomore, the Huskies are a scrappy yet disciplined team that can compete against experienced squads.</p>\n<p>NIU ranked second in the MAC conference this year allowing just 67.1 points per game. With 6’10 forward Marin Maric and All MAC-Defensive Player Aaric Armstead down low, this duo will try and stymie shooters like Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent from getting good looks and driving to the basket.</p>\n<p>While the Huskies finished ninth in the MAC in terms of shooting production, 72.7 points per game, look for an even distribution of scoring by Montgomery’s starters to carry the load offensively.</p>\n<p>Four out of five starters are currently averaging double-figures in scoring for Northern Illinois with Maric leading the pack at 12.1 ppg. The redshirt sophomore from Croatia has tallied home 14 double-doubles on the year, including two 22-point performances this season.</p>\n<p>In the backcourt, senior Travon Baker will be the primary player that the Gauchos’ defense will attempt to contain. NIU’s all-time leader in steals with 181 and second in school history with 355 assists, Baker is a savvy guard who can draw double teams and open up opportunities for his teammates.</p>\n<p>Guards like Vincent and Childress must do a good job keeping Baker in front and limiting his playmaking ability.</p>\n<p>Tip off between the Gauchos and Huskies will take place at 4:30 p.m. CT, 2:30 p.m. PT. The matchup will be broadcasted live on CBS Sports Network.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-back-in-action-take-on-niu-in-vegas-16/","id":333,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[332,331,330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos’ Season Ended in 88-76 Loss to Hawaii in Big West Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a historic ending to the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team saw its nine-game winning streak come to an end in its 88-76 loss to Hawaii Friday night in the Big West Conference Tourna...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a team-high 22 points from senior Michael Bryson, a 24-3 run opening the second half helped the University of Hawaii to defeat the UCSB men’s basketball team by a final score of 88-76 in the Semifinals Round of the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68937\" style=\"width: 306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68937\" data-attachment-id=\"68937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/michael-bryson-pushes-the-ball-to-his-teammate-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Michael Bryson pushes the ball to his teammate.

The newly crowned Big West Player of the Year connected on four of his first five shots, including two early threes, which handed Hawaii a 14-9 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Mizzou-transfer finished with 24 in points and seven rebounds in 31 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Warriors managed to extend their lead to 10 points as senior Aaron Valdez scored six straight points starting with a dunk assisted by forward Sai Tummala with 8:47 to go in the first. The third-year guard tallied his third double-double of the season finishing with 19 points and ten boards. This was also Valdez’s third straight game with 18 points or more.</p>\n<p>Following a 27-17 outpour by Hawaii, Santa Barbara responded with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>Guard Gabe Vincent helped turn things around scoring seven points in the final four minutes of the first period. The sophomore answered a Jankovich three with a make form beyond the arc, helping trim UCSB’s deficit to one at 30-29.</p>\n<p>Vincent then took a strong drive to the rim and gave the Gauchos their first lead since the 15 minute mark of the game at 31-30. The Stockton, CA native shot 46.7 percent from the floor for 17 points. Santa Barbara finished 9-2 in conference play when Vincent shoots above 40 percent, both losses coming to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>While UCSB only trailed by three heading into the break, the Gauchos were unable to halt Hawaii’s 21-3 run ignited by senior guard Roderick Bobbitt.</p>\n<p>Connecting on three straight three-pointers to open up the second half, Bobbitt scored 12 of his total 21 points in the final 20 minutes of play helping Hawaii maintain its lead. The Oakland point guard contributed distributing the ball as well tallying four of his five assists in the second period and grabbing at total of six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A big margin of difference lied in Hawaii’s field goal percentage and trips to the line. The Warriors shot 52 percent from the floor as well as hitting 27-37 free throws. Santa Barbara, a team who has shown consistency at the line, finished 16-27 from the free throw line. The Gauchos also took 10 more shots than Hawaii, going 26-60 from the floor, but finished with 43.3 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Alex Hart gave a much needed boost off the bench for UCSB. The sophomore forward finished with a career-high 13 points, shooting a perfect 3-3 from three-point range. Eric Childress also played a role on the defensive end. The junior guard finished with a career-high six steals, four of which came in the first half including three-straight steals with six minutes to go.</p>\n<p>However, the efforts of both players would not be enough to prevent the Rainbow Warriors from securing their 88-76 victory. Hawaii will attempt to win the conference championship in hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2002.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-12/gauchos-season-ended-in-88-76-loss-to-hawaii-in-big-west-tournament/","id":330,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[329,328,327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West Tournament against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team will attempt to continue its historic end to the season in its Quarterfinal game versus UC Davis in the Big West Conference Tournament.

Since then, Santa Barbara has swept teams such as Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside, and upcoming opponent UC Davis during this tenured win streak.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there were a lot of people that believed when we were 3-5 we’d move back to the upper echelon of the league,” UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Our team has definitely responded well [following this start].”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this essence of hot streaks towards the end of the season is nothing new for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos ended Big West play last year on a five-game winning streak finishing against notable teams such as then first seeded UC Davis, third seeded UC Irvine, and fifth seeded Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Despite ending this season on such a good note, Santa Barbara does face some challenges when matching up against UC Davis. The Aggies host some offensive threats in Neal Monson, Josh Fox, and Darius Graham.</p>\n<p>Although not as effective in the Aggies’ two losses to UCSB during the regular season, Monson has been relatively efficient as of late, averaging 16.5 points in the past two games. In his third year at UCD, Monson is coming off a career night last Saturday against Cal State Northridge in which he registered his third double-double of the season with 21 points and 15 rebounds. These were both team-highs as Monson helped propel the Aggies in their 87-83 triple overtime win on the road.</p>\n<p>The duo of Fox and Graham will also be key for the Aggies against Santa Barbara. Fox, this year’s All-Big West Second Team honoree, has been a reliable scorer for Davis. The senior forward has proven to be dangerous down low scoring 20 or more points on six occasions this year as well as tallying double-figures in scoring in 21 games this season.</p>\n<p>Fox recorded 17 points in his last outing against Santa Barbara, going 8-15 from the floor along with seven rebounds. His ability to maneuver his way into the paint and take quality shots can be attributed to his versatile scoring capabilities as he ranked sixth in the conference with a 51.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe will have their hands full containing both Fox and Monson in the frontcourt as they will attempt to deny the Aggies’ interior attack and hope to limit Davis from scoring easy points in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior Darius Graham is another central component to Davis’ unit. Awarded this year’s Big West Hustle Player of Year, it is Graham’s tenacious effort at both ends of the court that makes him a vital piece to the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>While Graham is only one of three Aggies who averages double figures in points, alongside Fox and junior guard Brynton Lemar, it is his motor and willingness to scrap for loose balls that sets him apart from the rest.</p>\n<p>Aside from Graham’s gritty demeanor on the floor, the third year player has proven to be a threat from beyond the arc. In his last two games against the Gauchos, Graham has hit 6-10 shots from behind the three-point line including a 3-4 performance from downtown in the Aggies’ 72-66 home loss to UCSB on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Williams will rely on the shooting core of Michael Bryson, Gabe Vincent, and John Green to propel his team to victory.</p>\n<p>The three have been the most consistent for UCSB, averaging more than half of the team’s points— scoring 42.7 of the Gauchos’ 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>After missing six games this season due to a knee injury, three of which were during conference play, the redshirt senior is coming along nicely. Green is shooting an efficient 53 percent from the field during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</p>\n<p>“[John] has had great support around him,” Williams said. “He is a very strong man and drives through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.”</p>\n<p>Green has scored in double figures five times during the team’s current eight-game winning streak, including a team-high 14 points to go along with 10 rebounds on senior night in the Gauchos’ 69-50 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“[We’re playing] with more discipline, but at the same time just having more fun,” Green said. “We’ve been trusting each other more.

It was the fifth straight game in which the Gauchos never trailed.</p>\n<p>Hitting a three-pointer during the first drive of the game, sophomore guard Gabe Vincent set the tone for his team. The former Big West Freshman of the Year finished with 20 points off 8-12 shooting. Vincent’s defensive presence aided the Gauchos as well, recording two steals including one off Davis’ guard Darius Graham leading to a fast break dunk.</p>\n<p>Quality offensive possessions in the first half were the determining factor for UCSB. The Gauchos went 16-30 from the field, 53.5 percent, in the first period and were able to move the ball around the perimeter and knock down open shots. Head Coach Bob Williams’ first unit was on point tallying 32 of the team’s 42 points in the first half.</p>\n<p>Senior Michael Bryson played a large role in this, going 6-8 from the field and scoring 16 of his team-high 24 points before halftime. The All-Big West guard also hit five three’s in the game, knocking down four of these in the first 20 minutes including back-to-back perimeter shots with 6:42 and 6:00 to go. This was Bryson’s ninth game of the season with 20 or more points.</p>\n<p>The Aggies showed some resilience however, as a miscue from senior T.J. Taylor led to a fast break dunk from guard Lawrence White which brought the score to 26-20. Santa Barbara then responded, taking a 16-3 run to finish out the first half with a 42-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ scoring attack remained persistent in the second half. With a 20-point advantage, guard Eric Childress drove to the left side of the rack and converted on a nifty reverse layup.</p>\n<p>The junior had a full stat line finishing with nine points, four rebounds, three steals, and a game-high six assists. Santa Barbara is now 9-4 on the year when Childress averages five or more assists.</p>\n<p>Senior John Green was effective off the bench for UCSB as well. The forward recorded his fourth-straight double figure performance with 14 points and five rebounds. Green is currently averaging 15.2 points per game in the team’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos outhustled the Aggies in rebounds, second-chance points, points in the paint, and most significantly bench points with Williams’ second unit winning the battle 27-5. Overall, UCSB shot better from the field finishing with a field goal percentage of 54 percent to Davis’ 42 percent and connected on 11-23 shots from three-point range.</p>\n<p>In hopes of keeping the game within reach for the Aggies, Bryton Lemar and Siler Schneider carried the scoring load for UC Davis. The two finished with 16 points apiece.</p>\n<p>The true freshman Schneider stepped up big for the Aggies, playing 32 minutes and shooting a perfect 4-4 from beyond the arc. The Lansing, Kansas native set the all-time record for the most freshman points scored in team history with 287.</p>\n<p>Following a slow first half, senior Josh Fox finished his final Big West game with 14 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB will stay alive in March, advancing to the Semifinals of the Big West Tournament and will face No. 1 seeded Hawaii. Tipoff is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. Friday’s game will also be nationally televised on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-11/gauchos-extend-streak-to-nine-games-face-no-1-seed-hawaii-tonight/","id":332,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[331,330,329],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
