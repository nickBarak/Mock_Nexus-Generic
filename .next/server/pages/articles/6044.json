A mass of reporters and photographers began to pool behind a low iron gate. On the opposite end, frenzied crowds gathered. Between them, a lifeless red carpet connected the street to the theater doors. The reason for the chaos on Friday, Jan. 30 was written in lights on the marquee: Jennifer Aniston, the recipient of this year’s Montecito Award, given by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF).</p>\n<p>The awaited actress finally pulled up in a black SUV at around 7:40 p.m. She was immediately met with the fans’ screams and a surge of white papers shoved over the iron barrier. Upon arrival, Aniston’s fiancé, Justin Theroux, swiftly made his way across the carpet and silently retreated in the theater, leaving unnoticed. This was his way of being careful not to detract from his fiancée’s night. Being the seasoned and diplomatic Hollywood actress that she is, Aniston was sure to attend to the fans first. After quelling their screams, she began making her way down the press line, pausing periodically for questions and pictures, as over-exuberant fans belted the “Friends” theme song in an attempt to win back her attention.</p>\n<p>The primary reason for the 45-year old actress’s presence at SBIFF was her recent performance in Daniel Barnz’s dark independent drama, “Cake.” With its issues of chronic pain and addiction, “Cake” doesn’t quite fit the actress’s repertoire of lighter romantic comedies, or even her more emotional films such as “Marley &amp; Me.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I asked the New York native what her least favorite part of filming the atypical role of Claire was, to which she carefully responded, “Stopping it! I really had so much fun, as difficult as the role was. It was quite a lovely set and we had a beautiful, fun creative experience together. Everyone was sort of getting out of their real selves and taking a risk, and everyone was really supportive each of each other and it was…” her voice trailed off, before she dreamily sighed, “I was in heaven, so I was sad when it was over.”</p>\n<p>The actress of over 25 years was not nominated for the exclusive Montecito Award, but rather chosen. Although the foremost reason for this award is her role in “Cake<em>,</em>” it dually honors the countless other performances that have paved her successful career.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8 o’clock the hoard of ticketholders for the night’s event flooded the theatre, as Aniston sat down for an extensive interview accompanied by various clips of her past performances. The talk completely sold out the Arlington’s 2,000 seats, a rare feat. Her entire acting career was spanned, beginning with her years spent at a “Fame”-style performing arts high school in New York. After years of determination, double shifts and failed pilots (“Ferris Bueller” TV series anyone?), a fateful summer in L.A. finally led Aniston to her role as Rachel on the iconic “Friends.” A star was born.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston quickly became a major household name in the 90s and has continued as one into present times. Even then, she makes it a point to mention that it’s still hard for her at times to land specific roles she wants. This is partly due to the baggage that comes with being a world-famous actress conflicting with the desired obscurity of smaller films. There’s also the tragic tendency for artists to be pigeonholed into one role. Still, she enjoys the challenge of consistently proving herself, stating she “had to lobby” for the chance to play Claire in “Cake.”</p>\n<p>Watching the numerous filmstrips from the theatre’s balcony, it is hard to deny the often-overlooked variety of Aniston’s roles and the specific talent delivered in each one. Her equal love for making big budget as well as independent films is clear with the juxtaposition of films like “Horrible Bosses” and “He’s Just Not That Into You” with “Office Space” and “Friends With Money.”</p>\n<p>Going against the famous “one for them, one for me” rule commonly cited by big-name actors, Aniston discussed the different types of fulfillment she receives from routinely dipping into both ends of the cinematic spectrum. Throughout the event, it was obvious that she genuinely feeds off of the artistic pleasure she gets from acting. After receiving the award, Jennifer Aniston abandoned her pre-written speech and spoke from the heart. Tears streamed down her face as a physical artifact embodying raw gratitude.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/jennifer-aniston-sells-out-the-arlington-to-fans-cake-star-receives-montecito-award/","id":6044,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6043,6042,6041],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan","biography":"Not available","articles":[5967,5979,6017,6026,6044,6065,6941,6963,6972,6981,7032,7059,7066,7079,7088,7651,7722,7729],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Lessons Learned from “Gone Girl,” Spoiler Alert!","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Before going to see “Gone Girl,” the only two things I knew about the movie were that David Fincher directed it, and that it’s about a girl who’s … gone.

Needless to say, I didn’t really know the plotline or what to anticipate. But as a fan of David Fincher’s work (“The Social Network,” “House of Cards,” “Fight Club”), I knew it had to be good. After watching it, I can say that it is as good as, if not better than, any Fincher film.</p>\n<p>“Gone Girl,” based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, is a beautifully frightening film that tells the story of the complicated marriage between Nick and Amy Dunne, played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. The film centers on the mystery behind Amy’s unexpected disappearance on their five-year anniversary. As part of an elaborate scheme for revenge on her cheating husband, Amy disappears and leaves clues that frame Nick as a murderer.</p>\n<p>Nick has no idea where his wife has gone, but as more clues are revealed, they point to the idea that he had something to do with her disappearance.

What we should all learn from Amy Dunne is to <em>not</em> do what she did.</p>\n<p>While she was a beautiful, intelligent and extremely cunning character, she was also mentally troubled, soulless and vengeful. It is heartbreaking for a person to let go of the significant other that doesn’t love them anymore, but manipulation and trickery are not the way to force the relationship to keep going.  Her plan may have been successful, but it could never happen in real life.</p>\n<h3>There are two sides to every story.</h3>\n<p>In the beginning of the movie, the audience is not given the full story. All signs point to Nick as the murderer and Amy as the victim. But when the film reveals Amy’s agenda, everyone stops hating Nick and starts to sympathize with him.  In the end of the story, the media and the townspeople are convinced that Nick and Amy are the perfect couple, not knowing the real truth about their relationship and the lies that they both told.</p>\n<p>Just like real life, it’s easy to make assumptions about people or situations after hearing only one side or source, especially when one is a close friend.  People are often biased and the only way to figure out the full, accurate story about anything is to ask everybody involved.</p>\n<h3>You should never alter yourself to fit someone’s mold of what is cool.</h3>\n<p>Amy tried really hard to become her husband’s idea of a perfect woman, whom she labels the “Cool Girl.” The Cool Girl is a “hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes and burping; who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth while somehow maintaining a size 2.”</p>\n<p>She’s the type of girl that’s “understanding, never gets angry and only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.”  Amy later admits that that type of girl doesn’t exist and that she never felt like she could be herself. She may have been a sociopath, but she serves as a reminder that altering yourself to please others never ends up well.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/Ym3LB0lOJ0oframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Ym3LB0lOJ0o\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57029\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/lessons-learned-from-gone-girl-spoiler-alert/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57029\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/lessons-learned-from-gone-girl-spoiler-alert/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/lessons-learned-from-gone-girl-spoiler-alert/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/lessons-learned-from-gone-girl-spoiler-alert/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/lessons-learned-from-gone-girl-spoiler-alert/","id":6041,"author":{"id":746,"name":"Erika Lee"},"related":[6040,6039,6038],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF: “Desert Dancer” Premieres on Opening Night Plus Exclusive Interviews with Star Reece Ritchie and Director Richard Raymond","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-courtesy-of-sbiff.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Even though Santa Barbara is mostly famous for its beaches and natural landscapes, every year at the end of January the coastal city becomes the place to be for filmmakers and movie lovers.

The Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) is a 12-day celebration of all things cinema. Folks from all around the world travel here to catch the latest premieres and mingle with the hottest celebrities. Notable names this year include Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell. On Jan. 28, SBIFF welcomed its 30th anniversary with the opening premiere of the film “Desert Dancer.”</p>\n<p>Starring “Slumdog Millionaire’s” Freida Pinto, “Downtown Abbey’s” Tom Cullen and “Prince of Persia’s” Reece Ritchie, “Desert Dancer” tells the real-life story of young male dancer named Afshin Ghaffarian , who was born in Iran, a country where dancing is forbidden. Growing to love dancing, Afshin (Ritchie) is taught to resist his artistic abilities at a very young age.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at college, he is quick to discover a group of friends who encourage him to free himself. Having no dance background, Afshin teaches himself the moves through the only safe option he could find, YouTube. After watching countless instructional dancing videos, Afshin teaches his group of friends the basics of modern dance. The group begins rehearsing in secrecy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Then enters Elaheh (Pinto), a beautiful yet troubled classically trained young dancer who becomes Afshin’s ultimate dancer partner. Together, Afshin and Elaheh begin an emotional love story revolving around their passion for dance. Set amidst political turmoil of Iran’s 2009 presidential election, the dancers endure pain, love and separation while continuing to perform their greatest joy.</p>\n<p>However, as Afshin becomes increasingly targeted for his desire to dance, he realizes that the only option to fulfill his dream is to flee to Paris and leave his friends behind. He is liberated from his oppressive state and finds a new home in France, where he is granted political asylum and allowed to accomplished his greatest dream: to dance in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>First-time director Richard Raymond heard of Afshin’s life story in the most unusual way. “I had read it in a newspaper<em>, The Sunday’s Times</em>, a story about a young man Afshin Ghaffarian who wanted to become a dancer. But in Iran, dance was forbidden,” said Raymond in an interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em> on the red carpet. “I couldn’t believe it, I was shocked — I couldn’t believe that something as innocent as dancing could be forbidden.” The young director explained the underlying message of his film, saying, “I believe that art can free anyone from oppression.”</p>\n<p>As the story spread about Afshin, Raymond’s independent film was financed by people who believed in its strong message. “The whole concept of freedom and speech, freedom of expression, it’s very important to have that,” said executive producer Mohammed Al Turki. “It was incredible that this film was only made with four million dollars.” Considering “Desert Dancer’s” star-studded cast and expensive location spots in Morrocco, London and Paris, the film made the most of its menial budget.</p>\n<p>Leading stars Pinto and Ritchie took drastic measures to prepare for their roles. To portray the elegance of a classical dancer, Pinto took rigorous dance training for a year. “The physical challenge was really difficult — blisters, pain, it was really hard,” said Ritchie. “Dancing on sand is nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p>But things started to look up for Ritchie when he re-evaluated his role as Afshin. “You suddenly realize that it’s about the impulse that this person is trying to express, rather than the technical brilliance of the dance,” said Ritchie. “I love that it was different, it was a story about freedom. Instead of car chases and gun fights, it was a human story, [one] that happened only four or five years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” is an emotionally-charged film with an important message: art is freedom. The story of Afshin Ghaffarian serves as a beacon of hope for any young individual who has the desire to achieve their biggest dream.</p>\n<p>“Desert Dancer” opens in select theaters on April 10.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60303\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60303\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sbiff-desert-dancer-premieres-on-opening-night-plus-exclusive-interviews-with-star-reece-ritchie-and-director-richard-raymond/","id":6042,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6041,6040,6039],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academy Award Winning Actress Diane Ladd Reminds UCSB to Fight For the Arts","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Thursday, Oct. 23 UCSB’s Pollock Theater was filled with film connoisseurs anxiously waiting to see award-winning actress Diane Ladd on the big screen and in person.

The room was overwhelmed with applause as we watched her name appear on the screen before witnessing her performance as Flo in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 film “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” Her on-screen delivery moved our hearts as expected, but it was her off-screen words of advice that challenged our minds.</p>\n<p>Ladd is a three-time Oscar and Emmy nominee and has earned an Academy Award for her many performances in film and television. She’s an accomplished actress, writer, director and author in addition to being a loving wife and mother. Her film résumé is untouchable and her roles are countless, but none of us can forget her performance as Flo in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Ellen Burstyn as Alice, a widow who travels across the country with her son in hopes of pursuing a singing career and starting a new life. Along her journey Alice meets Flo, played by Ladd, a rebellious waitress who serves meals with a side of sass. From telling Alice that unbuttoning her shirt will get her more tips to forcing Alice to woman up and make a decision, Flo is the friend that keeps it real and keeps us laughing. It’s no wonder Ladd won the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress for the role.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After watching the film, the audience rose to their feet to applaud the accomplished actress and welcomed her to the stage for a little Q&amp;A. Her charming Southern accent and witty speech wooed us again as she told us stories about her life and experiences working in the film industry. She told us about how she surprised the world with the miraculous birth of her daughter Laura after doctors told her it would be impossible. Laura Dern went on to follow in her mother’s footsteps and the two actresses have worked together in films such as “Wild at Heart” (1990) and “Rambling Rose” (1991).</p>\n<p>When asked what working with Martin Scorsese was like, Ladd replied, “Marty is one of the greatest directors that I have ever worked with before in my life.” She talked about how great it was working with a director who loves you because the director-actor relationship is like a marriage. “Marty’s a New York director and with New York directors, you don’t talk with them til’ after lunch!” she joked.</p>\n<p>Ladd and her daughter Laura work hard to bring back roles for women. “It’s very hard to get the men in the profession to read a film script written by a woman, especially one who is an actress,” she confessed. Ladd is working with Scorsese again in her upcoming film “Woman Inside,” which tells the story of Martha Mitchell during the Watergate scandal.</p>\n<p>Meeting Ladd and hearing her speak was truly an inspiration. The first thing she said to me after the Q&amp;A was that she liked my dimples and that her mother used to tell her that dimples were a sign that the angels kissed you as a baby! Could she be any sweeter?</p>\n<p>Her humor and kind spirit attest to her humility, her talent is unmatched and her passion is raw. Ladd reminded us, “Films bring great truth to human beings and bring opportunities for us to see ourselves.” She encouraged us to work hard and have faith in all that we do. And her humor is just as witty and clever in person as it is onscreen.</p>\n<p>Check out Diane Ladd’s organization for the promotion of education, culture and literacy called The Art and Culture Task Force.
