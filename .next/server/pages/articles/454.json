The subject almost fell to ground several times before the officer had reached him, and people walking near him had to move out of the way to avoid being bumped.</p>\n<p>The deputy approached the man and grabbed his arm. The subject looked at the officer with his big bloodshot, watery eyes and pleaded to the officer, “Take care of me.”</p>\n<p>The officer easily determined that the man was drunk, and arrested him for public intoxication. The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Kicking and Screaming… and Crying<br>\nThursday, Sept. 22, 2:03 a.m. – Officers were alerted to a belligerent 21-year-old man when a cab driver dropped him off at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station after he refused pay a $100 cab fee.</p>\n<p>While the deputy was talking to the driver, the subject stood to the side, yelling that he refused to pay the fare.</p>\n<p>The officer contacted the subject, who smelled like booze and had vomit on his shirt and pants. The subject was oblivious to the officer, and continued yelling at the driver.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to question the man and asked him where he lived. In a moment of astounding maturity, the man responded, “I’m not telling you,” and started walking away from the cab.</p>\n<p>The deputy decided the man was too intoxicated to care for his safety or the safety of others, and arrested him for public intoxication. When the officer questioned the subject to prepare him for booking, the man was uncooperative and initially refused to answer questions.</p>\n<p>The subject then began crying, and said he just wanted to go home.</p>\n<p>While returning the man to his mommy may have been just what the subject needed, the officer decided he should take a short time out – in jail.</p>\n<p>As he was transported to the holding cell, the man began kicking the back seat of the vehicle and said, “I didn’t drive! I was just trying to get a free ride…”</p>\n<p>The man was placed in a solitary safety cell in the Santa Barbara County Jail, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Just Chillax, Mr. Officer<br>\nSunday, Sept. 24, 1:45 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of El Colegio Road after receiving reports that a belligerent man was hitting apartment windows and trying to fight people.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived at the scene, several people in the courtyard of the apartment complex pointed to the 20-year-old man who was disturbing the neighbors.</p>\n<p>A few drinks were not the only thing the man had pounded that night, as the officer observed him beating on someone’s front door.</p>\n<p>The officer restrained the man and escorted him away from the apartment. While doing so, the officer noticed the man’s balance was unsteady and he reeked of alcohol.</p>\n<p>The deputy informed the man he was under arrest, and the subject told the officer, “It’s cool, homie.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 30, 1:04 a.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw two 17-year-old women stagger westbound down the street.</p>\n<p>One woman was making it down the street by bouncing off every three or four cars as the other subject was practically carried by a doting gentleman.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the trashed trio and placed the car hopper on the curb for her safety. He began questioning the seemingly caring couple, but to everyone’s surprise – including the drunken duo’s – the pair did not know each other.</p>\n<p>The officer sent the man away, and attempted to find out where the girls were planning to stay for the night. Both of the subjects said they could not remember who their friends in I.V. were or where they lived.</p>\n<p>The officer decided the women were both too intoxicated to care for their safety or the safety of others and placed them under arrest for public intoxication. Upon hearing the charge, one of the women corrected the officer, saying she was not drunk – she had only smoked marijuana.</p>\n<p>Since getting stoned and staying out after curfew are still illegal in California, the officer transported both women to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where they were booked, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-10-04/police-blotter-9/","id":454,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[453,452,451],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore","biography":"Not available","articles":[454,2872,3823,3860,3861,3863,3883,3884],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Captures First Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After three consecutive losses to national top-25 teams, the UCSB men’s tennis team finally breathed a sigh of relief after escaping with a 4-0 victory in its ITA Kickoff match against #62 Troy on S...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After three consecutive losses to national top-25 teams, the UCSB men’s tennis team finally breathed a sigh of relief after escaping with a 4-0 victory in its ITA Kickoff match against #62 Troy on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re happy because had a really tough start,” said junior Mathieu Forget, who was the first off the court against Troy in a 6-0, 6-3 win. “We played pretty well despite having three losses. We knew we were good enough to beat these guys and got the win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also faced off against #7 Florida — the regional tournament’s host — on Friday, losing 4-0 but managing to take their first doubles win of the season. Forget paired with sophomore Ben Recknagel to best the Gators at #1 doubles, 9-8 (4). Senior Alex Konigsfeldt provided UCSB with another highlight on Friday, beating #28 Sekou Bangoura 6-3, 3-1 before the match was called because Florida already had the four points necessary to win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Alex, since the beginning of the year, has been really impressive,” Forget said. “It’s his last year and I think he wants to do really well. If he’s playing that way, he’ll bring us a lot of wins.”</p>\n<p>Konigsfeldt continued to play at a high level in Saturday’s consolation match, which he won 6-2, 6-3, along with the rest of the squad. Going into the day’s matches, Troy was ranked #62 in the nation, just one place behind #61 UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We figured it was going to be very close and it was,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “We had to come from behind to win the doubles point and then we got off to a great start in singles and put them away. It was important for us psychologically to get out of town with a win.”</p>\n<p>The victory brings the Gauchos to 1-3 on the year as they prepare for their first home match of the season against #47 University of San Diego on Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>“[Last weekend] confirms that we are playing pretty good tennis and we needed that win because we have a monster match against San Diego,” Davis said. “It gives us a little momentum I hope and a little confidence. It was our first extended trip as a team together so it was a bonding experience as well, and I think the team chemistry is really good.”</p>\n<p>Forget, for one, sees no lack in his team’s confidence level.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that we can compete against schools that are top-10 or 20 in the country is something that’s going to help us out a lot,” Forget said. “They have some really good players, but if we can play consistent and focused and motivated, as we did against the other teams, I’m sure we’ll be fine.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-30/ucsb-captures-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-30/ucsb-captures-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-30/ucsb-captures-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-30/ucsb-captures-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-30/ucsb-captures-win/","id":451,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[450,449,448],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Routs UC Irvine On the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-02-01-at-12.10.48-PM.png?resize=800%2C419&ssl=1","description":"After having its four-game winning streak ended in its previous, the UCSB women's basketball team got back on the winning track with a blowout win over UC Irvine on Saturday.

It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Anteaters, placing them in eighth at 3-18 and 1-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s three-point shooting barrage was active from the game’s first quarter as it went 7-10 from long distance. All but one of the Gauchos’ eight field goals were made from downtown as they made seven-straight to close the period.</p>\n<p>Both Hernandez and redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter, who returned from injury after sitting out the game at CSUN, were spot-on from long range. Each scored nine points in the opening period to power UCSB’s 23-7 run. Limited to 11 minutes, Porter was proactive with her time on the court as she ended with 15 points on 5-8 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine, who was without two starters due to injury and had just three players coming off its bench, couldn’t find its rhythm on the offensive end. The Anteaters ended the first period with more made free-throws at 4-4 than field goals at 3-for-10.</p>\n<p>Scoring one of UCI’s field goals and half of their free-throws was senior forward Shereen Sutherland. She had a team-high 20 points on 5-for-11 shooting and a career-high 10-of-11 free-throw performance. Still, the Anteaters trailed 23-11 at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s dominance continued in the following quarter with a 9-2 scoring run. Hernandez added two more three-pointers before halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe silently had an efficient performance of 12 points on 4-for-6 and 2-for-2 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact was the emergence of UCSB’s bench. Redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler and sophomore guard Makala Roper each were effective as Toler was fearless in her drive for layups and Roper followed suit along with displaying her midcourt range.</p>\n<p>A made layup by Roper gave the Gauchos a 43-19 advantage with 1:37 remaining before the half. She ended the game with nine points, while Toler had 12 points and a team-high three steals. Hernandez scored UCSB’s last basket of the quarter with a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>Although UCI’S senior forward Brittany Glassow responded with a three-point make of her own, it did not have much of an impact on the Anteaters’ deficit as they trailed 46-24 at halftime.</p>\n<p>Glassow led Irvine’s small bench rotation with six points on 2-for-3, 1-for-1 three-point shooting and tied for the team-high of six rebounds in 29 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Similar to how they both started the game, both Hernandez and Porter sustained their hot shooting hands in the second half. Pouring on makes from three-point land, both backcourt players went 2-for-3 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Porter was responsible for six points during the Gauchos’ 8-0 run in which they tallied their largest lead of 30 points at 60-30.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s spark came from Sutherland with nine points and senior guard Irene Chavez with five points but would not be enough to prevent the Gauchos from entering the fourth quarter 73-44 lead.</p>\n<p>A 5-0 run to open the fourth quarter showed the Anteaters’ unwillingness to accept defeat, but they couldn’t contain the Gauchos from closing out the game behind the play of Toler.</p>\n<p>Toler scored three-straight layups, scoring the majority of the team’s five field goals in the quarter. Despite its ability to make 18-of-23 free-throws, UCI’s poor shooting of 38.8 percent and 4-for-16 three-point shooting curtailed any chance of it making a comeback as UCSB earned the victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to the Thunderdome to face Cal State Fullerton this Wednesday, Feb. 1. at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-30/ucsb-routs-uc-irvine-on-the-road/","id":452,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[451,450,449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Streak Ends, Faces UC Irvine Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-26-at-12.49.49-PM.png?resize=795%2C402&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team was unable to preserve its four-game winning streak, losing in its first game back on the road at Cal State Northridge.

Porter currently leads the Gauchos in scoring during conference play with 13.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also unable to contain the Matadors’ rhythmic shooting night. CSUN benefited from its backcourt players in both its starting lineup and bench rotation.</p>\n<p>After scoring a career-high 25 points last Saturday versus Cal Poly, redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe surpassed her career-best total with 28 points in the Matadors’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Combining with Maulupe for 49 of CSUN’s conference game best 75 points was sophomore guard Cheyenne Allen with a career-high 21 points on 6-for-9 shooting from the field and an 8-for-9 finish at the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Overall, CSUN shot 48.2 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>In addition to Maulupe and Allen, helping create the Matadors’ hot shooting was their rebounding.</p>\n<p>They outrebounded UCSB 47-27 as freshman forward Eliza Matthews had a game-high 12 rebounds and sophomore center Channon Fluker had 11.</p>\n<p>UCSB will wrap up its pair of away games for the week against UC Irvine this Saturday. Prior to facing Santa Barbara, the Anteaters will play Hawaii tonight at 9 p.m. PST. They will enter the Stan Sheriff Center at 3-16 and 1-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Various pieces have contributed to the Gauchos’ upgrade in play since the start of Big West play. A central piece has been the productivity of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman.</p>\n<p>In just her first season as a Gaucho, she has already solidified her role in the paint.<br>\nQuick enough to use her pivot foot and strong enough to post up and drive on a defender,</p>\n<p>Edelman has been nearly unstoppable as she holds the Big West lead in field goal percentage at 56 percent.</p>\n<p>Prior to scoring her lowest point total in a conference game with three on Wednesday, Edelman had posted double figures in four straight games.</p>\n<p>Despite grabbing a team-high 10 rebounds, Edelman’s offensive production was missed, as UCSB is 8-3 when she manages to score in double figures.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine’s women’s basketball program is in rebuilding condition after its decline in recent years.</p>\n<p>En route to its third-straight losing season, the Anteaters have not had a winning season since their 2013-14 run. In the past two seasons, UCI had a combined 12-51 record.</p>\n<p>The downward spiral led to the hiring of first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue during the offseason last April.</p>\n<p>Despite losing just one senior from last season, UC Irvine has a multitude of players that lack in-game experience. All five of the team’s current seniors had never started a full season entering this year.</p>\n<p>In addition to the hiring of a new coach, the Anteaters are still dealing with the lingering effects of the early departure of their most impactful player last season in former forward Mokun Fajemisin.</p>\n<p>On a team that had no double-figure scorer, Fajemisin managed to lead UCI in scoring with<br>\n9.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Yet it was her defensive and rebounding abilities that were most pivotal. She led the Big West in blocks per game with a 2.0 average and ranked fifth in the Big West with 7.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She was the conference’s ultimate rim protector as she ended last season with a conference-leading 54 blocks.</p>\n<p>Despite boasting an arsenal of three double-figure scorers — senior forward Shereen Sutherland, sophomore guard Andee Ritter and junior forward Sabrina Engelstad — UCI has had ongoing issues with both scoring and defending the ball.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are the Big West’s worst scoring defense, as they allow 72.2 points per game and are second-worst on offense with an average of 58.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains one of the conference’s top teams in terms of scoring the ball and playing three-point defense, ranking second by allowing just 63.7 points per game and third as it holds opponents to an average 29.2 percentage thus far.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Anteaters will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 28, at 2 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":yu\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/womens-basketball-streak-ends-faces-uc-irvine-next/","id":453,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[452,451,450],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
