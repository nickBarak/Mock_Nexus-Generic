Anderson takes the dark concept of a dog-vacant society and blends it together with a venturesome endeavour made up of five furry companions who come to the aid of a 12-year-old boy, Atari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly enough, when you say “Isle of Dogs” quickly, it comes out as “I love dogs” and Anderson does well in guiding us through the canine-passionate voyage. The four-legged mutts, which typically hold background roles, are at the forefront of this cinematic extravaganza. Among it’s opening sequences, the film introduces a community which has just banished dogs to a trash-filled island. Atari, voiced by Koyu Rankin, as he embarks on a quest to find his once trusty companion, Spots (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liev </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schreiber) finds himself encountering the rancid, garbage pervaded isolation. However, he also meets abandoned dogs, Duke (Jeff Goldblum), King (Bob Balaban), Rex (Edward Norton), Boss (Bill Murray) and Chief (Bryan Cranston) who accompany him on the journey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anderson has grounded himself in taking fascinating worlds from his imaginations filled with spontaneity and creativity to present them to audiences all around and expresses them in fantastic manners. With cartoonish and rapid fight sequences and silky cinematography for the canine romance between Chief and Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson)  captures the essence of filmmaking in unorthodox and fun ways. The combination of Japanese culture woven together with Anderson’s compositional aesthetic make for grand moments which are pretty to the eye. His cinematography is best known for the meticulously chosen imagery and quirky shots which are used frequently throughout this film.  His irreplicable use of stop motion and styles are so smoothly inserted throughout “Isle of Dogs” which are what make the film unique</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isle of Dogs” makes for a joyous adventure. The beauty of a film like this, as with most Wes Anderson films, is its ability to encapsulate a variety of emotions meshed with societal concepts which raise awareness in a multitude of ways. The simple idea of helping an outcast group merge together with society is the movie’s main premise –– and has always been a prevalent topic in the societal climate of most eras throughout history. Throughout, Anderson exemplifies how to infuse such discussions in a not too overwhelming manner, which does not tarnish the atmosphere that he develops with the remaining entirety of the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atari is a character whom is somewhat naive but is also just a kid. And as any other kid, he is curious about the world. Anderson uses his power to test the limitations which restrict the young mind. Thinking about the childhood, playground moments where I stood on top of the highest platform of the jungle gym and pretended to take off on a rocket ship are brought to life by Anderson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, dogs don’t actually speak English (although Anderson does his best in translating barks), which is what makes the film so fun and sets it apart from other “man’s best friend” flicks. Hearing the voices of big time actors and actresses such as Murray and Johansson was incredibly amusing, and the idea in and of itself sounds entertaining. Nevertheless, as pets which become close to humans, these animals have such beautiful ways of communicating to the world. The plot emphasizes the four-legged playmates’ capabilities to make a connection with humans. The relatability of these elements are what render viewers vulnerable to the emotion-evoking moments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isle of Dogs,” serves as a reflection of Anderson’s inquisitive perspective of the world. The simplicity of the ideas which linger throughout his mind are brought to light on the big screen and in the funnest of ways. Anderson does not hesitate with the creation of his plots and as long as this remains the case, he will keep audiences howling with joy.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

awards season. The film is a perfect children’s film about family and a boy with a dream that takes places in a vibrant Mexican town of Santa Cecilia during <em>Día de Los Muertos</em>. The fun adventure that follows left me laughing throughout and crying by the end. “Coco” was my favorite film of the year and deserves to take the Oscar. The other nominations deserve credit, especially “Loving Vincent” for its use of real impressionist oil paintings in every frame of the film. In any other year, a film with that level of innovation would have a real chance to stand up to Pixar, but “Coco” is unstoppable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Actor</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Not Gary Oldman</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Gary Oldman</p>\n<p>Gary Oldman’s performance in “Darkest Hour” is great. He’s a veteran actor who knows what he’s doing, and his ability to sink into a character that you might not expect from him is admirable. But let’s be honest, this is an extremely safe choice the Academy is going to make. “Darkest Hour” is a film that ticks every box for in the no-one-will-remember-this-in-five-years category. Instead, the Academy ought to give the award to Daniel Kaluuya, Timothée Chalamet or Daniel Day-Lewis, but it would be shocking if it did.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Actress</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Saorise Ronan</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Frances McDormand</p>\n<p>I enjoyed Ronan’s naturalistic and believable persona as the titular character in “Lady Bird,” but Frances McDormand deserves to be the favorite here as well. She goes on a crusade in “Three Billboards” and is the driving force behind a film that is getting Best Picture buzz. Her role certainly asked her to do more than Emma Stone’s performance that netted her the trophy last year. In the end, while I’d like to see Ronan take it, McDormand has earned the trophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Director</strong></p>\n<p>Who Will Win: Guillermo del Toro</p>\n<p>Who Should Win: Guillermo del Toro</p>\n<p>The Best Director/Best Picture split from the past few years might not bode well for “The Shape of Water” winning cinema’s biggest award because Guillermo Del Toro seems like a lock for Best Director. Del Toro’s work has always been imaginative, and this film might be his tightest and clearest depiction of that fantastical vision. The film’s imaginative use of color, costume, set design and visual effects oozes Del Toro as he brings the various elements into perfect harmony. No other director could imagine the fantastical flooded tableau that begins the film or the green hued color palate that dominates its visual landscapes. While many critics might point to identity politics as the reasons behind a possible Del Toro win, I would disagree. Mexican directors have won the Oscar in 2013, 2014 and 2015, but Del Toro won’t win because of the Academy’s interest in Mexican filmmakers; rather he will win because his individual voice shines through, just as Cuarón’s and Iñárritu’s before him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best Picture</strong></p>\n<p>Who Should Win: “Get Out”</p>\n<p>Who Will Win: “The Shape of Water”</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this is simple: “Get Out” is a cultural touchstone that will be remembered long after we forget “Darkest Hour” and “The Post.” Have you ever seen someone argue about Phantom Thread on Twitter? Now, every year we don’t give the Oscar to the movie with the biggest cultural momentum. But “Get Out” is not only an Internet touchstone, it is also a film deserving of such high honors in its technical aspects. The original screenplay has pushed writing in the horror genre forward in a way not seen for decades. The actors deliver incredible performances and Jordan Peele’s directorial voice is clear and captivating, despite “Get Out” being his debut film. “Get Out” needs to win the Oscar, but even if it doesn’t, it will remain in our consciousness long after we forget these other films.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s hard to predict the Best Picture Oscar, particularly will the influx of thousands of new voters in the last few years. I can see a few films winning the award, including my personal preference, “Get Out.” The favorite seems to be “The Shape of Water.” His is not a particularly traditional choice, but Del Toro’s film represents the way film can take viewers to a new, strange world. “Dunkirk” is another film with buzz, especially as the Oscars draw closer. While the film is indulgent in its cinematography and visuals, its storytelling leaves much to be desired, and Nolan shouldn’t win for a film that doesn’t live up to some of his other work. Still, the more traditional voting bloc of the Academy might heavily back “Dunkirk.” “Lady Bird” is a charming indie film, but doesn’t deliver enough to set it apart from others in its genre. “Three Billboards” might win on the back of McDormand’s one-woman crusade and act as a symbolic gesture toward the #MeToo movement, but it seems to have lost some momentum throughout awards season. “Get Out” being a horror film could hold it back. “The Shape of Water” pulls ahead as the slight favorite and would be a deserving winner, but the race is fairly wide open, so get your popcorn ready folks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81744\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/artsweeks-2018-oscars-predictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81744\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/artsweeks-2018-oscars-predictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/artsweeks-2018-oscars-predictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/artsweeks-2018-oscars-predictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/artsweeks-2018-oscars-predictions/","id":5769,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[5768,5767,5766],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Donald Glover’s Surreal World of Atlanta","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FullSizeRender-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FullSizeRender-2.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Atlanta” is nothing like any TV show the world has ever seen before.

Moments like these ring true amidst the unthinkable events happening around the characters and similarly set a new contextual lens for the audience to perceive those events. Donald Glover’s self-written, -acted and -produced passion-project “Atlanta”is amazing at doing this exact thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show contains countless ridiculous instances for the main characters, including but not limited to a shooting, a black, Christian Justin Bieber, a fourth-grader wearing white face, wringing out a baby’s diapers to try to pass a drug test, buying drugs from the Migos and, in the season two premiere, Katt Williams holding an alligator in his bathroom. Despite this and constant hilarious scenes of humor, the most important and lasting moments of “Atlanta” are just that: moments. Little quotes, particular song choices, landscapes and stylistic anomalies all add up to one of the most brilliant shows our generation has ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glover and his team have meticulously made very specific and keen decisions here to produce an incredibly funny, intelligent, clever and — for lack of a better word — woke piece of televised artistry. These decisions contribute to a powerful message of race, gender, poverty and struggle that is extremely crucial to the surrounding culture. With both Golden Globes and Emmys under its belt, “Atlanta” is definitely the show to watch right now and is the show that our divided culture needs now more than ever before.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While revolutionary film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out” breaks ground in presenting the black experience in an all-white context, “Atlanta” finds success in presenting the black experience in a black context, where deadbeat intellectual Earn observes the broken institution around him and asks real questions. Following Earn and his on-the-rise rapper cousin Al — also known as Paper Boi — the general theme of the show is that their environment throws them curveballs and they react accordingly. For reference, the best model of this comes in the pilot when you see Glover’s face after his white friend says the “N”-word. Although I personally cannot relate, I imagine that the constant events like these are used in the show to accurately demonstrate the modern black experience: a lot of bad things happening and a lot of questions. And Glover asks all the right questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In episode two, while in the police station awaiting bail, we see this kind of passive intellect in action. Arguments and anecdotes happen all around Earn, and later, when he sees a deranged homeless person beaten by police, he says, “Why is he in here every week? He looks like he needs help.” In the finale to season one, we see Al show the same kind of confusion after he witnesses a drug dealer get shot and killed by police; “Ya’ll really need all them bullets man?” In these instances of an unconventionally passive main character, the audience begins to see the power of the environment of Atlanta and the sad truth about agency in the people of these communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the show’s most powerful moments, however, we can see the characters in “Atlanta” giving us some answers. Paper Boi’s talk show mic drop in season one, episode seven shakes “Atlanta” to its core when he rants, “Caitlyn Jenner is just doing what rich white men been doin since the dawn of time, which is whatever the hell he want.” Later, in episode nine, the tension builds to Earn’s glorious rant at the plot’s climax, where he erupts on Vanessa’s mom and stepdad. In a satisfying storm of words, Earn snapped to the white stepdad, “Stop stunting on me about my culture. I’m not gonna go back to Africa and find my roots because you know what? I’m fuckin broke dude. And stop being so likeable. And don’t be like ‘I understand,’ because you don’t understand.” The carefully placed victories and moments of clarity from the show are powerful and create a narrative that is effective in building tension.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the well articulated commentary on race, “Atlanta” also finds a voice in speaking on other social issues such as poverty, sexuality and masculinity. Earn always functions as the voice of reason in managing his cousin’s rap career, suggesting notably in the finale that, “stunting is kind of a trap. We should probably make a little bit more money first before we start showing it off.” Although a logical and obvious statement in the given context, scenes like these in the show really speak to much larger issues, which, in this instance, is the ongoing phenomenon that young successful rappers often have trouble managing money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the season we see homosexuality and masculinity in the black community being addressed when two guest actors argue about how gay it is to be with a man in drag. After one man claims that men have sex with men in jail anyway and that it is still not frowned upon, he is met with the response, “Yeah but that aint gay, that’s just jail. You was on the outside … That boy gay as hell.” In the most uncomfortable and equally hilarious example of commentary, a talk show in episode seven documents a young black male that instead chooses to identify as a thirty-five-year-old white man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What these anecdotes display is “Atlanta”’s ability to properly address social issues by sometimes depicting real everyday situations and sometimes flipping those concepts over on themselves. This, again, is reflective of the observant nature of the cast of characters. In providing these intellectuals with odd, crud and culture-bending situations, justice or not, a much larger and articulate picture is painted about what is really going on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite “Atlanta”’s countless strengths such as cast, dialogue, symbolism and cinematography, the most important — and truly the coolest — is representation. “Atlanta” is unapologetically black in a historically white industry and is reaching audiences of all backgrounds. Also, while many shows about marginalized communities use their premise as sort of a gimmick, “Atlanta” succeeds in accuracy and tells intricate stories through the black lens. To simplify, “Atlanta” does not parade blackness around for others to observe from their own view, but rather puts the audience into the black experience. One of the most exciting ways “Atlanta” does this is, of course, through the soundtrack, which features almost exclusively black artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the show follows a rapper and his cousin manager, Atlanta appropriately has an extremely high rap representation. This newest episode alone features Tay-K’s on the run anthem “The Race.” Larger rappers like Kodak Black and Gucci Mane are also featured and proper homage is given to Atlanta icons Outkast in the finale to season one. “Atlanta” also finds proper backgrounds in genres outside of rap, by including artists such as Kamasi Washington and Curtis Mayfield on the roster too. The most memorable moment of representation is undoubtedly the Migos cameo. It comes as a celebratory moment of reflection for the city of Atlanta, as the city’s biggest musical success ever is featured and even shown selling drugs as a throwback to what funded the start of their career. These references to black culture provide satisfying nods to the people that understand them and, more importantly, expose a larger audience to the amazing things that it has to offer. Much like how a rap sample leads listeners to go back and find the sample’s origin, “Atlanta” is showcasing an exciting culture and, hopefully, leading others to explore it more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Atlanta” is nothing like any TV show the world has ever seen before. It is more real and more black than any show has ever been. It takes risks, it immerses the audience and it speaks huge volumes in brief moments. It has, in a little over a year, done wonders for black culture, shedding light on semi-hidden issues and taking what we thought we knew about race and turning it on its head. Through introspection and criticism, “Atlanta” makes us as viewers tackle real world issues head on. This amazingly complex, weird and intelligent creation from Glover shows a world of potential for the future of the artist. He may not be the one to save our divided world, but he can definitely tell us where to start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/","id":5770,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5769,5768,5767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Watch Mikey Alfred’s Colorful ‘Summer of ’17 Episode 2’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The skating and film world merge thanks to the mastermind behind “Illegal Civilization,” director Mikey Alfred.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSnpzP_NrWY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=14&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>The skating and film world merge thanks to the mastermind behind “Illegal Civilization,” director Mikey Alfred. He depicts the societal pressures that come along with the transition into adulthood in “Illegal Civilization’s Summer of ‘17 Episode 2.” The Los Angeles scenery encapsulates the short film, with odes to the GOLF store on Fairfax, NoHo and Burbank. The first segment of the “Summer of ‘17” video depicts a distraught teenager caught in the midst of simplistic, suburban love. Yet, the second segment shows the raw emotion of family betrayal, the necessity of friendships and feeling as if you are not enough.</p>\n<p>Alfred always pursued becoming a filmmaker, crediting Martin Scorsese as one of the influences that etched a mark in his desire to experiment with film. He initially got involved in filmmaking through filming skate clips that exemplified camaraderie, as shouts of approval echoed whenever Tyshawn Jones or Sage Elsesser landed a tailslide.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The whole concept of camaraderie and friendship bleeds through Alfred’s “Summer of ‘17,” where at the end of day your friends are the ones who are going to appreciate your worth and push you ahead. The sincere moments of friendship shine through Paul’s (Nico Hiraga) willingness to pay for the debt, Tony (Aramis Hudson) owes money to his mom and Paul being the only one to cheer up a defeated Tony in the final scene.</p>\n<p>Even the subtle banter the actors/skaters share over stealing another friend’s fries in the middle of a skatepark bring light to the importance of friendship. The music within the film adds to the seemingly dreamy wonder by playing the equally whimsical “BLEACH” by Brockhampton and Cuco’s “Lo Que Siento.” Alfred focuses his directorial eye on introducing people of color into his narratives, a narrative that shows the reality of Los Angeles. To its nit and grit, Los Angeles is composed of a majority of POCs channeling their creative outlets with companions.</p>\n<p>In Alfred’s perspective, his company is much more than guys landing their switch backslides in “Illegal Civilization” gear. “Illegal Civilization” champions chase creative endeavors and embrace your friend’s creative strides along with yours.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81900\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/watch-mikey-alfreds-colorful-summer-of-17-episode-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81900\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/watch-mikey-alfreds-colorful-summer-of-17-episode-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/watch-mikey-alfreds-colorful-summer-of-17-episode-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/watch-mikey-alfreds-colorful-summer-of-17-episode-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/watch-mikey-alfreds-colorful-summer-of-17-episode-2/","id":5771,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[5770,5769,5768],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
