These four reporters begin an investigation into the sexual abuses committed by the Catholic clergy in Boston. Eventually, they go on to uncover a conspiracy that goes up to the Cardinal himself.</p>\n<p>The Screen Actors Guild recently deemed the film’s cast to be the best of any film in 2015, and it is easy to see why. What makes the performances great is that they balance being compelling and believable; they feel <em>natural. </em>These characters feel like they have working relationships with each other. They talk and emote like real people on account of an impressive degree of subtlety that the actors display. You don’t watch these big-name Hollywood vets and think that they’re obviously acting, trying to be someone they’re not. These are <em>real </em>people onscreen, so convincing is the illusion. It almost feels voyeuristic, like you’re spying on the actual journalists.</p>\n<p>Mark Ruffalo briefly disturbs this atmosphere when he delivers an impassioned diatribe to a stoic Michael Keaton. It feels a little like exposition in order to further drive home a point, but given how impassioned he feels about the issue he’s covering, I can buy the outburst.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>That’s because it is definitely a story worth getting upset over. The Spotlight staff interviews several victims throughout the film, who describe, in vivid and gut-wrenching detail, what happened to them. You feel the hopelessness that these people, mostly men from broken homes, faced. This feeling is perfectly encapsulated in one brief shot: Brian d’Arcy’s Matt Carroll stands on an apartment balcony, taking notes as he interviews a victim. The two of them are framed against a massive Boston cathedral, looming ominously in the background.</p>\n<p>When “Spotlight” ends, it’s bittersweet. Although justice has been, in a way, served, I still wanted to see the aftermath. What happened to these journalists? How did the exposé affect their careers? What were the immediate effects of the article on the Catholic Church? I want more! Gimme a sequel! To me, that is a sign of a powerful story.</p>\n<p>But it does feel lacking in some regard. There was a particular narrative angle I thought was going to play out, mainly because the film suggested it. Stanley Tucci tells Mark Ruffalo’s Michael Rezendes that eventually, the massive beast that is the Catholic Church will eventually go after him. And they never do. The film doesn’t even make clear whether or not the Church was ever even aware that an investigation into their cover-up was underway. It feels like a piece of the narrative is missing.</p>\n<p>But I do want to make clear that what <em>is </em>here is great. I was totally engrossed in the team’s investigation. Like them, you feel curious about what’s really going on around Boston.</p>\n<p>You share their curiosity, their shock. You sympathize with the victims as they tell their stomach-churning stories. And you feel abject horror when you realize how long and how deep the conspiracy goes. The film ends with a list of cities that has known pedophile priests.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is one of them.</p>\n<p>Gives you the chills, doesn’t it?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div

manages to draw an engaging assortment of industry professionals to speak on the ins and outs of their trade, which is most likely at least partially due to the festival’s snug proximity to the Academy Awards ceremony. A woman in line for the panels could be overheard speaking about how, because it’s after the Oscars, the San Francisco festival she’s involved with gets a far shabbier turnout of celebrity guests than Santa Barbara’s. Indeed, every speaker on the back-to-back producers and writers panels is nominated for an Oscar this year, working on some levels to promote their films among the city’s menagerie of retired Academy voters.</p>\n<p>Though the writer’s panel was, unsurprisingly, the more compelling of the two, the speakers on “Movers &amp; Shakers,” the producer’s panel, shared some intriguing behind-the-scenes tidbits about their respective projects. Brooklyn’s Finola Dwyer spoke on the challenges of transforming Montreal into 1950s New York, and Mary Parent of “The Revenant” similarly remarked on the magic of transcribing the 1820s American Midwest upon the isolated snowy peaks of Argentina. Parent also quipped that it was the first production she’d been on that set an electric fence up around the caterers to protect them from hungry bears; fortunately, everyone on set avoided Hugh Glass’s grisly fate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both Jeremy Kleiner (“The Big Short”) and Steve Golin (“Spotlight”) discussed how their systematically challenging films are set to be screened for representatives of the very institutions they criticize, the former to a group of bipartisan congressmen, and the latter at the Vatican itself. On the topic of challenging institutions, the (all white) panelists very briefly, semi-awkwardly touched on the issue of the Oscars’ lack of recognition of diverse talent. Kleiner shrewdly noted, “The Academy is at one end of a long chain of decision making,” scratching the surface of the overwhelming bias toward white involvement in all aspects of film industry production. While it’s true that the Academy’s nomination decisions take place at the far end of this chain, producers’ roles are at the other; they acknowledged the problem without drawing any productive conclusions concerned with solving it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68152\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-68152\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1391039039\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"68123\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68152\" data-attachment-id=\"68152\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/sbiff-panels-_-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Writers Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68152\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Panels-_-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-68152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / <em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Writers Panel</p>\n<p>An hour and a half after the producers panel, every seat of downtown’s historic Lobero Theatre filled up as the sold-out “It Starts with the Script,” the festival’s largest panel of screenwriters to date, started up. All but two of this year’s 10 writing Oscar nominees took the stage to share insightful perspectives on their content and their craft.</p>\n<p>Pixar legend Pete Docter (“Toy Story,” “Monster’s Inc.,” “WALL-E,” “Up”) explained how often, the crux of a story doesn’t materialize until well into the writing process. He described coming upon a storyboarder’s sketch of the characters Joy and Sadness hugging, with the inscription ‘embrace sadness.’ “Wow,” Docter relayed, “That’s the movie!” That small incident led him to the film’s central theme: “the deeper happiness that comes from its relationship with sadness.” “Ex Machina’s” writer-director Alex Garland expressed similar structural perceptions. “Stories are like maths in some respects,” he noted. “The equation might just not work.” His observations on managing the intricately balanced ecosystem of a story drew murmurs and nods of assent from the rest of the panelists. He said that once you’d worked out and balanced issues in a script, “it’s not like the problems are gone, but they’ve settled, like all the spikes have gone down.”</p>\n<p>The writers went on to discuss thoroughly the nature of adaptation. Emma Donaghue wrote “Room,” an adaptation of her own novel, and found it “hugely satisfying to take this story and tell it over again.” She was especially delighted in seeing her characters have physical bodies, capable of expressing human subtleties words themselves can’t sufficiently describe. Donaghue also brought up a difference between film and novel writing that rang with veracity for her fellow writers, in that “A book has so much more room, so much more time … Film has this narrative thrust; it moves forward.” Jonathan Herman, writer of “Straight Outta Compton,” sardonically joked, “I understand why they hired me, ‘cause I’m a white, Jewish gay guy from Connecticut.” In adapting NWA’s story for the screen, he noticed “a “Rashomon” thing going on,” with Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E’s widow, Tomica Wright, all reporting conflicting versions of the story. In addition to struggling to capture a semblance of true events, Herman faced a hurdle in convincing hip hop mogul Ice Cube to be comfortable with his character exhibiting moments of weakness. “This is the way a movie goes,” Herman explained. “You gotta have a low point and some vulnerability so you can come back from it, you gotta have an arc — the audience will like you more that way.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Short’s” Charles Randolph shared perhaps the most engaging perceptions on the panel. Regarding his emotional standpoint while writing the film, Randolph explained that he was disheartened by the events of 2008, as he’d “always had this nagging feeling that our system was fair, that there was a tangible connection between success and moral goodness.” He embellished on “Short’s” use of narration and cutaways to break down its economic jargon, used by influential bankers to “obfuscate and hide and empower themselves.” The techniques also added to the film a “meta layer which not only described the things, but gave the audience something beyond the characters to connect with.” Aside from the probing intellectual discussion, Randolph admitted to slacking off as much as anyone else. He agreed with Josh Singer’s (“Spotlight”) praise of research, adding, “The great thing about research is you can just read the most obscure crap and think at the end of the day that you did something.”</p>\n<p>Other writers shared their treatises on procrastination; as a writer, it was encouraging to hear that professionals, too, have less-than-perfect working habits. Charlie Kaufman (“Being John Malkovich,” “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”), writer of the existential stop-motion drama “Anomalisa,” shared that in terms of having a solid structure, “I tend to try not to. When I have an idea, I like to keep the idea of exploring it alive.” He has also learned to build downtime into his writing, observing astutely, “When I’m blocked or procrastinating, I’m still writing. I just don’t know it.” “Carol” writer Phyllis Nagy also owned up to exhibiting unorthodox writing practices. “I write with constant stimuli,” she said. “I have to have the TV on, I have to have the radio on.” Drew Goddard penned “The Martian,” and shared a quirky anecdote about how, since his wife writes comedy and he writes drama, they avoid both genres. Instead, they “just watch really bad reality television.” Thus, the inspiration for “The Martian’s” “turn the beat around” scene struck him while he and his wife sat in bed watching Bravo.</p>\n<p>The panelists all provided fest-goers with unique, intuitive, unexpected perspectives on what it means to write films, imparting on them a greater understanding of this year’s most lauded releases and the act of filmmaking itself as an art.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-producers-panel-and-writers-panel/","id":5901,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[5900,5899,5898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Spotlight” Shines Light on Church Abuse and Media Decline","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Keaton-McAdams_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Keaton-McAdams_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Spotlight” is a story of an exposé of child sexual abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests.

Surveys by the American Society of News Editors and the Pew Research Center estimate a 36 percent decline from daily newspaper editorial jobs since its peak in 1989.</p>\n<p>The state of investigative journalism is even more worrying. With the exorbitant amount of time and intricate research required to expose an issue — not to mention potential dead ends and legal battles — investigative writers are often the first to go. Reputable papers with award-winning investigative reporting projects such as Denver-serving <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> and national publications <em>Newsweek </em>and <em>Time</em> have either closed up shop or laid off most of these reporters.</p>\n<p>“Spotlight” follows four investigative reporters and their uncovering of a widespread scandal concerning child sex abuse and cover-up within a powerful institution, the Roman Catholic Church. These journalists, who were part of <em>The Boston Globe’s</em> investigative unit named Spotlight, and their media take a stand for justice and for reporting that won’t tolerate abuse by power-wielding individuals and institutions.</p>\n<p>“‘Spotlight’ has given a voice to all the survivors and has become a call to action for pursing justice around the world in regards to this issue,” said Mark Ruffalo, who was a late cancellation due to personal family matters, in an apologetic and appreciative video message that kicked off the event. “And being part of a truly beautiful ensemble cast with real chemistry was such a phenomenal experience for me and such a rare experience.”</p>\n<p>The film has had an incredible and poignant impact on the institutions, people and stories it portrays. Just last Thursday on Feb. 4, a Vatican commission on clerical sex abuse held a private screening of “Spotlight” on the eve of its three-day meeting at a church residence in central Rome.</p>\n<p>The day before on Feb. 3rd, SBIFF’s Executive Director Roger Durling himself published a column in the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, opening up about his traumatic experiences as a victim of priest child abuse and how movies saved his life by allowing him to feel vindicated. It’s a notion he continued to uphold as he moderated a discussion between Keaton, who plays editor Walter “Robby” Robinson, and McAdams, who portrays reporter Sacha Pfeiffer.</p>\n<p>“Film can help us not to feel alone because we’re all in the dark experiencing the same emotions and same things that are being projected on the screen,” said Durling. “What’s amazing about ‘Spotlight’ to me is that it’s more than just a film, it’s a cry of victory.”</p>\n<p>When asked if she knew what the outcome of the film would be, McAdams expressed that she didn’t. Though shocked at first in realizing how little she knew about the issue, she also recognized the need to tell the story.</p>\n<p>“The more I got into it, the more I realized you sort of can’t tell the story enough,” said McAdams. “So it became a no-brainer to do it regardless of the outcome and I’m so grateful that this is the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The evening took a trip down memory lane with clips from Keaton’s and McAdams’s most memorable films, including segments from “Mean Girls” and “Birdman.” Both stars have played an array of roles, but still manage to maintain honesty in approaching their characters, Durling notes, particularly praising McAdams’s empathetic yet driven interviewing method with the victims in “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>“I really took the lead from Sacha herself because Sacha is such an incredible listener,” said McAdams. “She just has an amazing ability to get people to open up.”</p>\n<p>Keaton, for his part, spent a lot of time with Robby in order to nail his character, keeping a keen eye on his mannerisms, his Boston accent and the solid way he held himself. However, he did not predict the depth and wide-ranging scope of the film’s significance either.</p>\n<p>“In terms of its impact, one would be, I think, presumptuous and extremely egotistical to think anything more than this is just a good thing to be a part of,” said Keaton. “You just go and do your best.”</p>\n<p>Keaton’s own impressive filmography includes two others — Ron Howard’s “The Paper” and Mick Jackson’s “Live from Baghdad” — in which he also plays the role of a reporter. A self-described news junkie, Keaton had once considered a career in journalism (having taken one or two classes in college), and, though he settled on acting, he never lost his journalistic curiosity.</p>\n<p>“When you’re dealing with news or journalism, which for me makes it exciting not just as an actor but also in life, it’s humming,” said Keaton. “There’s a frequency. When something’s reverberating, you can feel it because it’s true.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the newsrooms drew Keaton back in as he relays his plan to head back to his hometown of Pittsburgh with Robinson to speak to the staff of the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,</em> as well as to screen “Spotlight” and help fundraise for the paper.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a great editor there who I think was at <em>The Boston Globe</em>,” said Keaton. “And he’s trying not to lay people off.”</p>\n<p>This situation plays out all newsrooms with editors desperate to keep their staff intact amidst dwindling funds and readership. “Spotlight” itself addresses this issue when newly hired editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) of <em>The Boston Globe</em> expresses his concern to Walter “Robby” Robinson (Keaton) about declining subscription numbers and the Internet’s breach and disrupt into the classified business.</p>\n<p>“So you anticipate more cuts?” asks Robby.</p>\n<p>“I would assume so, yes, but what I’m more focused on right now is finding a way to make this paper essential to its readers,” answers Baron.</p>\n<p>“I like to think it already is.”</p>\n<p>“Fair enough. I just think we can do better.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that’s a conundrum with no easy fix. After more than a decade of news media decline and many attempts later, we are still searching for ways to “do better.” Furthermore, most child sexual abuses don’t end with just an exposé. Society constantly needs watchdog journalists to follow up. That’s a tall order now as many newsrooms in America are being held together by only shoestrings and bandages.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/spotlight-shines-light-on-church-abuse-and-media-decline/","id":5902,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5901,5900,5899],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“The Force Awakens” Brings Back What We Love","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/starwarsTFA1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/starwarsTFA1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“I’ve never seen so many nerds in one place.” I said that to my father as the theater continued to fill up with kids and adults, most wearing Star Wars T-shirts.

It was the first time he and I sat down together to watch a Star Wars movie in a decade. I am a long-time fan, and as clichéd as it is to say, Star Wars has been a huge part of my life. It got me into science fiction, helped me form friendships and even taught me math. My father, however, had come more out of curiosity than devotion. He saw the original film as a teenager and, while initially holding it in a favorable light, never became the kind of guy who tries to use the Force when the remote control is out of reach.</p>\n<p>We came to the (mostly) same conclusion upon exiting the theater. Good. Flawed, but good.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Force Awakens” owes a lot to its predecessors plot-wise. Instead of being a full-on sequel from a storytelling perspective, it retreads more than a few familiar beats from the original trilogy. Once again, our heroes are confronted by a troubled man in black armor and a Nazi-inspired army with a big gun and troops that, to quote “Bull Durham” “couldn’t hit water if they fell out of a boat.” They have to escort the droid information everyone wants to the good guys. On the one hand, it reaffirms that this movie wants to be more of the fun, action romp that the Star Wars movies were long ago, rather than a stiff political drama with equally wooden acting. On the flip side of that coin, I didn’t have all that much to think about once the credits rolled other than, “They brought Luke back just to stand there?!”</p>\n<p>Thank goodness the movie compensates by being entertaining as all hell. The high-octane and fast-paced action scenes all complement the story, which, combined with its brisk pace, makes it feel jam-packed with thrills. And when was the last time you could say a Star Wars movie was hilarious? I’ll tell you: the ‘80s. It’s a natural humor that flows from how the characters play off of one another, rather than a pause-the-action-and-quip humor you would find in, say, “Age of Ultron.” My usually stoic father, the audience and I were laughing uproariously.</p>\n<p>The new protagonists are what bolster the film; they represent the shift from the past to the future. Desert native Rey takes center stage. In addition to being a total bad-ass, she serves as a new Luke Skywalker on account of her mysterious past and her path to unlocking her full potential. Finn goes from an understandably skittish stormtrooper to a brave fighter. Wow! Decent character development! Looks like J.J. rediscovered what George lost.</p>\n<p>Both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have a great rapport with Harrison Ford’s graying Han Solo. In the years since, neither Ford nor his beloved character have lost any measure of charm. Still the swashbuckler and a crack shot with a blaster, he is both the characters’ and audience’s bridge from the original to the sequel trilogy.</p>\n<p>Also, Kylo Ren is a great villain. Like Vader, whom he has a close connection to, he is powerful, clad in black, has an intimidating voice and is quite deadly with a lightsaber, yet he is also tortured and prone to express his anger in ways that make the lives of his underlings more than a little uncomfortable. I also feel that the other villains were somewhat overhyped in the marketing. Andy Serkis’s Supreme Leader Snoke doesn’t look quite as unique as described and Gwendoline Christie’s Captain Phasma is disappointingly irrelevant, thrown aside for the sake of a gag. This isn’t necessarily a flaw in the film itself, but I do feel as though I was deceived somewhat. Wonder if this is how people felt with the prequels…</p>\n<p>It breaks my heart to say this, but John Williams’s score is lackluster. As movie scores go, it gets the job done well enough, adding to the excitement and mood of each scene. But nothing stood out in the vein of classics like “The Imperial March” and “Duel of the Fates.” Oh well. There’s always Episode VIII.</p>\n<p>“The Force Awakens” is a little predictable and banks too much on the original, but its story, sound effects and practical effects make it feel like classic Star Wars sans the cheesy lines. This is the true successor both the nerds and general audiences have been waiting for. It’s a great Star Wars movie and a ridiculously fun film in its own right. I look forward to seeing it again when Magic Lantern brings it to I.V.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67210\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/the-force-awakens-brings-back-what-we-love/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67210\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/the-force-awakens-brings-back-what-we-love/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/the-force-awakens-brings-back-what-we-love/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/the-force-awakens-brings-back-what-we-love/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/the-force-awakens-brings-back-what-we-love/","id":5903,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5902,5901,5900],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
