Cal Poly actually had more kills, albeit by just two. Errors were even at 22 while the Mustangs also had a slight lead in total attempts.</p>\n<p>Someone digging through the individual numbers would be hard-pressed to find something of much significance either — though they would find out that there is one thing in particular that separated these two teams.</p>\n<p>A Mustang led both teams in kills, assists and digs. The immediate question then is how did the Gauchos come out on top, despite posting equal or inferior numbers across the board?</p>\n<p>Oh, and I forgot to mention, Big West superstar Lindsey Ruddins was sidelined with an injury she picked up earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>This means that UCSB toppled their archrivals — who are currently in a dogfight for first place with the Gauchos, I might add — a mere week after Hawai’i snapped their 13-game win streak without Lindsey Ruddins.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Maia Dvoracek led both teams with 19 kills, but UCSB’s Tallulah Froley was right there with 16 followed by Torre Glasker’s 10. That list was the same for errors, as each posted 9,6 and 6, respectively.</p>\n<p>Mustang Avalon DeNecochea dominated the assist game with 42 helpers, but only two of her teammates even recorded an assist at all. Those players were Mika Dickson and Jessica McRoskey, who recorded 3 and 1. Behind DeNecochea were Gauchos Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao who each dished out their own fair share of helpers at 23 and 17, respectively.</p>\n<p>Both Dickson and Lea Ungar each had a service ace for the Mustangs, but it stopped there. Vivao, Lovenberg, Zoe Fleck and Kobie Jimenez all served up two of their own plates while Glasker added one to make it 9 service aces for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>What happened Saturday night was nothing short of extraordinary. It’s only right that we place into the spotlight the many names that have stamped their mark in this incredible season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Dickson did lead both teams in digs with her 17, but Glasker shined once again with 16 and Lovenberg decided to add 11 of her own. Block assists — yes, block assists — will pretty much show you all Gauchos. UCSB’s 20-8 domination in block assists suggests that there was both movement on the court, but also a will.</p>\n<p>As cliche as it sounds, it was the will to win.</p>\n<p>Coming off their biggest loss of the season and taken down by the very team relentlessly tracking them to the top of the conference, the Gauchos dominated every inch of that hardwood flooring as they chased down every ball all night long. If there was a misplay on the ball, there was always someone there. The depth of this team is just unbelievable.</p>\n<p>Even without one of the best players in college volleyball, UCSB took a huge step forward in their quest for glory after defeating Cal Poly 3-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will first travel to Davis (who are just outside the top three of UCSB, Cal Poly and Hawai’i) and will be looking to start their last big push after having lost to Hawai’i last week.<br>\nUCSB will have Friday off before making the trip to Riverside on Saturday where underestimating their opponent may prove fatal. Riverside is currently last in the Big West with a 1-6 record in conference play and a 5-13 record overall.</p>\n<p>Both of these teams have already made the trip out to the Thunderdome this season and both have been swept out of town. Ruddins has yet to be confirmed for either matchup, but Saturday’s Blue-Green showing tells us the expectation should be nothing short of two victories for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play UC Davis this Thursday at 7 p.m. before a southern trip to UC Riverside for kickoff at 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90590\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/womens-volleyball-gaining-momentum-heads-out-on-two-game-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90590\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/womens-volleyball-gaining-momentum-heads-out-on-two-game-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/womens-volleyball-gaining-momentum-heads-out-on-two-game-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/womens-volleyball-gaining-momentum-heads-out-on-two-game-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/womens-volleyball-gaining-momentum-heads-out-on-two-game-road-trip/","id":5598,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[5597,5596,5595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro","biography":"Not available","articles":[3,1195,1196,1220,1225,4027,4077,4079,4087,4090,4866,4881,5587,5592,5593,5596,5597,5598,5599,5600,5601,5602,5603,5604,5605,5606,5607,5609,5677,5678],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Who Can Partake in Party Culture?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Living","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Laurel Rinehart challenges the assumption that UCSB's party scene is inclusive to all.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos pride themselves on many things, such as having access to the beach at any time, being able to navigate chaotic bike paths and the recent announcement of our spot as the No. 5 public school in the nation. One thing, however, stands out as the most heralded aspect of life at UCSB: the Isla Vista party scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB students have endless options for partying. As opposed to other schools where the parties are exclusively put on by fraternities or athletic organizations, Isla Vista offers a plethora of house parties along the ocean every weekend that are hosted by students in private, unaffiliated residences. This creates a party culture in which anyone, regardless of their involvement with Greek life or athletics, can find a location on a Friday or Saturday night where they will be able to drink and dance the night away. What makes UCSB party culture stand out is not the size or frequency of the gatherings, but its open and inclusive nature.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84100\" style=\"width: 398px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84100\" data-attachment-id=\"84100\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/who-can-partake-in-party-culture/image_123986672-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=1633%2C1563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1633,1563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image_123986672-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?fit=888%2C850&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-84100\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=388%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?w=1633&amp;ssl=1 1633w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=250%2C239&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=768%2C735&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C980&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image_123986672-8.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But is this narrative really true?

Almost every girl wears a full face of makeup and a variation of the standard uniform of high-waisted shorts and a crop top. There is nothing wrong with dressing this way — I myself have a closet full of “hoe clothes” from which I select my outfits every weekend — but it creates a pressure to conform for girls who wish to partake in the party scene but may not be comfortable putting their bodies on display for any number of reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the dress code, the rules for getting into parties are strict and largely based on gender. Conventionally attractive girls are almost guaranteed entry at every door; for male students, however, passage is much more complicated. In accordance with the norms at most other universities, fraternity parties are essentially off-limits for non-members. However, even the supposedly open house parties on DP are very exclusive and typically do not allow male students to enter unless they know the host of the party or are accompanied by a large group of girls. Residents of private homes have the right to allow or deny entry to whomever they choose, and I’m not suggesting that there should be some sort of requirement for parties to be open to every single student. I simply wish to bring attention to the underlying problematic message in the choice of who can and cannot enter: if you are not an attractive, sexually available female, there is no place for you in one of these gatherings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overtly sexual dynamic within parties is another aspect that isolates people who do not wish to partake in the “hookup culture” that has become synonymous with college life. While sexual comments and unwanted groping are the most prevalent at fraternity parties — at least in my experience — these behaviors are still the norm at any party you attend. While partygoers obviously have the option of simply hanging out with their friends and saying “no” to any sexual advances, there is an overwhelming feeling that if you are not open to advances or directly engaging in sexual dancing, you are in the wrong place.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the hookup culture of UCSB parties is overwhelmingly heterosexual. Look around and you will see numerous straight couples grinding or making out on the dance floor, but there do not seem to be spaces where LGBTQ students can express their sexuality so easily. The heteronormative aspect of college party life is often blamed on fraternity culture in think-pieces about American colleges in general; however, this exclusive norm extends beyond Greek life where UCSB is concerned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whiteness is another unspoken requirement for students to feel that they fit in at most house parties. Though I am white and cannot speak personally about minority students’ experiences, I have had conversations with several students of color who expressed feeling uncomfortable in the mostly white party crowd. For whatever reason, the percentage of people of color inside a typical party is even lower than that within UCSB’s predominantly white student body. There is no way of measuring whether this is due to non-white students being turned away at the door or if the dominant culture causes them to avoid parties altogether. Whatever the reason, there is unfortunately a normative racial pattern that makes people of color feel unwelcome or out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all these critiques, I am not saying that parties in Isla Vista should stop altogether or that students should boycott them. It is inevitable that partying will occur as part of the college experience, and no aspect of social life is completely immune from society’s norms regarding gender, beauty standards and sexuality. All I’m asking is for people to direct a more critical eye at the assumption that UCSB is an exception to the typical exclusivity at party schools solely because our parties are not controlled by Greek organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB party culture is the land where everyone is welcome. That is, everyone who fits the standards of both appearance and behavior for the perfect partygoer: white, in impeccable shape, heterosexual and willing to flirt and dance with strangers. We need to promote a new paradigm in which the diversity that UCSB claims to celebrate is actually present within its famous party scene.</span></p>\n<p><em>Laurel Rinehart wants you to question your perceptions of the party scene.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.

While Ruddins has been the more ferocious attacker, Matias in turn has proven to be quite a composed scorer herself. A small but not insignificant lead in hitting percentage means the edge in attack goes to Ruddins and the Gauchos. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore outside hitter Mahalia White is currently second on the team in kills with 176, a strong lead when compared to the Gauchos’ second-leading attacker Tallulah Froley and her 135. The big difference between these teams is in their depth and UCSB junior Rowan Ennis has played her part quite well to say the least, as represented by her 26-kill advantage over Demari Webb’s 86. The Gauchos lineup will feature not only the leading scorer but a player in Ennis who has been severely underrated due to Ruddins’ phenomenal showing this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the difference in records (13-1, 10-5) suggests UCSB has clearly been the better team, the Aggies have managed to sweep their opponents six times while the Gauchos have done it five times. But taking a closer look will reveal where the difference lies, as UCSB has been far more hungry in games where they were down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have been swept three times this season while the Gauchos have not once. An even closer look into the stats will show you that the Gauchos have won five games after having been down by one or two sets versus the Aggies’ one. So while the Aggies do have one more sweep to their name, they’ve been unable to climb back up when down in games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at last year’s matchups, the two games were split with Davis taking down Santa Barbara 3-2 while the Gauchos made amends with a 3-1 victory later in the season, yet another example of the Aggies’ inability to fight from the bottom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upperhand in scoring and scoring depth, hitting percentage, digs and track record all suggest the Gauchos should come out victorious; however, anticipating an easy win would be foolish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will stay in Santa Barbara where they will host UC Riverside on Saturday, a team that has expectedly stumbled out the gate after a disappointing 4-14 finish in conference last year as well as a 9-19 record overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB currently has the upperhand in kills, errors, assists, hitting percentage, service errors, reception errors, digs, every blocks category and total points. Throw in the records and UCSB is the clear favorite in this matchup. They’ve just been a much better team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out on top in both matchups last year including a 3-0 sweep in the latter parts of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of the Highlanders this season has been freshman Amarachi Osuji whose arrival has translated to a team-leading 144 kills and a fourth-place standing in digs with 90. With two less errors than Ruddins and a measly .183 hitting percentage, she has proven to be an extremely talented player with perhaps too much weight on her shoulders. Don’t expect her to steamroll this stout Gaucho defense, but don’t be surprised when she shows up ready to win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will host UC Davis this Friday at 7 p.m. while Saturday’s game against UC Riverside will kickoff at 5 p.m., both right here at the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ruddins-looking-to-make-good-on-11th-player-of-the-week-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ruddins-looking-to-make-good-on-11th-player-of-the-week-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ruddins-looking-to-make-good-on-11th-player-of-the-week-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ruddins-looking-to-make-good-on-11th-player-of-the-week-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ruddins-looking-to-make-good-on-11th-player-of-the-week-award/","id":5596,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[5595,5594,5593],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take 13-Game Win Streak Into Conf.

Abby Marjama (14), Loryn Carter (13), and Onye Ofoegbu (13) all posted double-digit kills while Kelly Negron led both teams with 30 helpers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will, however, take a step back and say that those statistics may paint a different picture than what the fans saw on Friday. Hawai’i led both teams in every category save for blocks, while digs were even. Unfortunately for Hawai’i, they also committed seven more errors than the Anteaters and will surely be hurting after they let the game slip away with a 23-25 third set loss. They never recovered and posted a measly 29 points over last two sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i then hosted Cal State Fullerton, yet another team recently swept by the Gauchos, where they scraped by with a 3-2 win that saw them post more errors than their opponents for the third straight game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Hawai’i had not committed more errors than any of their opponents during their 10-0 start to the season but have since committed more errors than their opponents in four of their last five matches. This stretch has seen Hawai’i’s Rainbow Wahine volleyball squad go just 11-10 in sets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hawai’i’s surprise loss against UCI can be chalked up to be a small blemish, it is important to note that teams in pursuit of the title must win the must-wins. UCSB has done just that, dominating every opponent aside from University of Colorado who managed a 3-1 victory a mere three games into the season. The difference here is that CU is a solid but average 8-6 team while Hawai’i seemingly assumed they’d continue their winning streak over the 4-12 Anteaters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Hawai’i split the series last year with the road team coming out on top in both matches. Hawai’i pulled off a 3-2 win at the Thunderdome while the Gauchos vacationed to a 3-0 sweep in Honolulu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Lindsey Ruddins tied Hawai’i’s McKenna Ross with 16 kills in the first match but led both teams with 11 at Hawai’i. Despite only posting 19 kills over last weekend’s two games, Ruddins has been in phenomenal form this season and will be anticipating arguably the brightest spotlight yet as the Gauchos look to carry their momentum through a long stretch of conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The games against against UCR and Davis proved that the Gauchos don’t need insane firepower every game, but that their depth is composed of players young and old that are more than capable of competing at the highest level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was not a single double-double by a Gaucho last weekend and yet they still walked away with two sweeps. This team is legitimate and they’re ready to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of our nation’s most ferocious programs will battle it out this Saturday at the Stan Sheriff Center in Manoa, Hawaii. The game starts at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/","id":5597,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[5596,5595,5594],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
