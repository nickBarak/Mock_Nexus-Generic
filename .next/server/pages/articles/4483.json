The ultimate fate of the CSD, however, hangs on the passage of the UUT.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p>This leads to another issue: deciding when to put the UUT on the ballot again.</p>\n<p>Elliott said CSD board members could very well decide to propose the UUT in the next midterm election in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74096\" style=\"width: 6010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1521561605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74096\" data-attachment-id=\"74096\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/flashback-election-2012/dsc03790/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=6000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dsc03790\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, running another campaign would prove costly, Freeman said, and organizers are unsure where to obtain funds for subsequent campaigns. He said it would also be difficult to have voters approve a tax that has already been denied.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>\nAccording to Freeman, those active in the CSD movement for the past two years never talked much about the prospect of the CSD passing without the tax.

She said they misled voters to believe the tax would significantly increase rent, when, in actuality, the tax would have only been an additional $5 to $10 every month.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes also gained an advantage over Yes on E&amp;F, she said, because they placed flyers on cars throughout Isla Vista. According to Elliott, this is what made Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes an “illegal” campaign.</p>\n<p>“If we left flyers on everyone’s cars, the results might have been different, but we would have been breaking county ordinance,” she said.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property owner who led the opposition to Measure F, said the measure didn’t pass simply because it is a “horrible” measure. This is why voters were afraid, he said.</p>\n<p>“What [Elliott] says is probably true, but a lot of times the truth will make people fearful of what will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Fear is the reason Measure F failed, Elliott said, and it has been a driving force throughout this election cycle.</p>\n<p>“In general in this election, fear won over hope,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/","id":4480,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4479,4478,4477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Series to No. 4 Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"  The UCSB baseball team had its biggest series of the year so far against first-place Cal State Fullerton this past weekend.

In addition, they were able to hand Fullerton its first loss in league play. The Titans move to 31-5 overall and 8-1 in conference play, maintaining hold of first place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Gauchos played a night game on the road, but did not seem to skip a beat from their previous few games as they again jumped ahead to an early lead 1-0 in the first inning. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell extended his hitting streak right away with a single into right center. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled with one out to move Newell to third, who then proceeded to score on freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic’s groundout.</p>\n<p>Bats then went quiet in the game as both starting pitchers were on top of their games. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone pitched seven and two thirds innings and allowed just two runs on 11 hits while striking out three. On the other side for the Titans, freshman Thomas Eshelman topped Pettibone with eight innings of work, just one earned run and seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Neither starter factored in the decision as the game was decided on a blown save and a loss by the Gaucho bullpen, allowing two runs in the bottom of the ninth. The Gauchos put up two runs in the top of the ninth to take a 3-2 lead, but a leadoff bunt in the bottom of the ninth began the trouble for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The bullpen then crumbled as two walks by freshman closer Dylan Hecht loaded the bases. He was replaced by senior reliever Jared Wilson who came in and threw a wild pitch to allow one run before a sac fly ended the game 4-3.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Fullerton came out and roughed up any Gaucho pitcher to take the mound. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome got through just three innings after he allowed six runs on eight hits.</p>\n<p>He was relieved by freshman Hector Lujan, who was also touched up for three runs in just an inning and a third. Freshman pitcher Domenic Mazza then came in to stop the offensive explosion and gave up just one run in his three and two thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Freshman Justin Garza of the Titans earned his seventh win of the season and is still without a loss on the year after his seven inning, nine strikeout performance.</p>\n<p>Game three was a flipped script after the previous day’s drubbing. Nesovic pitched six and two thirds innings of shutout ball. He allowed just four hits and struck out two but walked four en route to his first win of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ two runs would prove to be enough, as the Titans could not muster any offense.

Youth Projects has been serving since 1971 through four programs: the Children’s Center, the After School Program, the Family Resource Center and Thrive I.V.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center serves children up to five years old, the After School Program serves children in kindergarten through the sixth grade, the Family Resource Center serves families of all sizes and Thrive focuses on “preparing students to enter kindergarten” and the “social-emotional component,” according to Thrive coordinator Julie Lara.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects aims to develop their niche even further by purchasing the Children’s Center building they currently occupy at 6842 Phelps Road. To do this, they must raise $300,000 by Dec. 31 in order to qualify for an additional $300,000 block grant from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center started out as a “very small program with just 20 students,” according to Juan Pimentel, the After School Program director, but has grown to “over 100” with waiting lists for all of the programs.</p>\n<p>From an overall campaign goal of $1.9 million, $1.2 million will be directed toward the Children’s Center, according to LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons why the I.V. Youth Project finds it so necessary to purchase the building is to keep costs low for the children and families who use the services provided by I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges of living in Santa Barbara is the cost of living, and childcare is pretty expensive … so having a children’s center here in I.V. … at either a very low cost or on scholarship most of the time is a really great opportunity,” said Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Just like many of the students at UCSB who worry about rent increases, the I.V. Youth Projects shares those same worries about renting the space for the Children’s Center. Both Pimentel and Miller said owning the building would prevent increases in program costs and save money in the long term.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t too much money to sponsor, say, another parenting class or another need that we might see,” said Lara. By not having to allocate money for rent every month, Lara said she hopes “any funding that does come in we can use for actual programming to make our facilities better.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects will host several fundraisers over the next month, including gatherings at Woodstocks, Panda Express and Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch. The group has also teamed up with Deckers Brand for a holiday shopping event.</p>\n<p>Money is even tighter at I.V. Youth Projects due to the fact that the childcare organization is independent from any national nonprofit organization. Additionally, I.V. is an unincorporated city, so I.V. Youth Projects does not receive city funding, according to Miller.</p>\n<p>“We do have some funding from the city of Goleta and from the County of Santa Barbara,” Miller said, but the organization doesn’t have access to “a lot of the same funding revenue stream that a lot of the other nonprofits might have that are located within a city.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects welcomes donations from any and all I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any donation big or small helps,” Miller said. “It’s very important to us that every child, no matter where they live … deserves to have an equal access to a superior education and a good walk on life.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch fundraiser will be hosted Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 5-9 p.m. and the Panda Express fundraiser will be hosted Friday, Dec. 9, from 12-9 p.m. in the Fairview Shopping Center.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73793\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/i-v-youth-projects-seek-300k-to-fund-facility/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73793\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/i-v-youth-projects-seek-300k-to-fund-facility/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/i-v-youth-projects-seek-300k-to-fund-facility/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/i-v-youth-projects-seek-300k-to-fund-facility/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/i-v-youth-projects-seek-300k-to-fund-facility/","id":4482,"author":{"id":246,"name":"Malire Lozada"},"related":[4481,4480,4479],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
