He becomes just the fifth player to win a fourth MVP award, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six MVPs), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four). Those, of course, are some of the greatest names in basketball history and James’s achievements put him in their company. What’s more, as James is just in his 10th year in the league at just 28 years old, James could even pass these all-time greats.</p>\n<p>Winning back-to-back MVPs is not easy. Many people don’t think the same player should earn it in consecutive years regardless of whether or not that player was the best that year, but there was no taking that award away from James this year. He was dominant, and as a result, earned 120 of the 121 first-place votes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This might sound nitpicky, but James was robbed of a unanimous MVP vote. It should have been unanimous. He deserved for it to be unanimous.</p>\n<p>It would have been the first ever unanimous MVP vote. There have certainly been some unbelievable players in this league, but of course, there is always competition. This year though, James was simply that much better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>The MVP voting panel is made up of 120 sports journalists and broadcasters, with one vote also being an online fan vote. Obviously, there was one journalist who wasn’t so objective and failed in doing his/her job correctly.</p>\n<p>In my lifetime of basketball, I have never watched a player that I felt was head and shoulders above the rest enough to deserve the honor of an undisputed vote, but this year, it should’ve happened.</p>\n<p>Part of this is due to injuries. Many candidates throughout the season fell out of the race due to injury, such as Chris Paul or Tony Parker. Then take out Kobe Bryant having a chance to win simply because his team barely made the playoffs.</p>\n<p>That left James mainly in a one-man race with Kevin Durant. However, I am certainly not implying that James was simply handed the award; he completely earned it. Even halfway through the season, it seemed he was going to be the dead-obvious winner.</p>\n<p>This year, James became the first ever NBA player to go six straight games scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent from the field. If that wasn’t enough, he became the youngest player in NBA history to reach the 20,000 point plateau for his career. Then, he took five of the six Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards.</p>\n<p>Also, James is now the second player in league history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, with Larry Bird doing it three times. The only other player to ever accomplish such a feat once was Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>James wasn’t just taking easy shots either. He’s become a smart player offensively with time, becoming the second player in NBA history to shoot 55 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the arc, joining Chris Mullin.</p>\n<p>With such a spectacular season, who could have possibly earned that other first-place vote? It would be natural to think it was Kevin Durant, since he did come in second in MVP voting and had a great year.</p>\n<p>But no. It went to Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks, who finished third in the voting. This is where nothing makes sense, except for the fact that perhaps there is a New York reporter who has some beef with James. After all, there is an intense rivalry between those two teams.</p>\n<p>Yes, Anthony did win the scoring title this season, narrowly defeating Durant by scoring 28.7 points per game. But James averaged 26.8 points per game while tallying 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists per night. He shot a career-high 56.5 percent from the field, 11.6 percent higher than Anthony.</p>\n<p>James is also known for his defense, while Anthony is not. James earned the second-most votes on this year’s NBA All-Defensive team. He averaged 1.7 steals per game and, of course, is known for his monster blocks tracking down players in transition. He’s not a center, but he makes his opponents think twice.</p>\n<p>And yes, New York did go on a 13-game win streak at the end of the season to secure the second spot in the Eastern Conference, but James led Miami to the second-longest winning streak in NBA history at 27 games to secure the best record in the NBA, tallying 15 double-doubles and two triple-doubles in those 27 games. Plus, during New York’s win streak, they played Miami and did win, but the Heat had benched both Wade and James in order to save them for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Anthony is hands down a great player — there’s no denying that — but the MVP is supposed to go to the player that had the best year and Anthony should not have been in the running. James simply outdid everybody else.</p>\n<p>So to that one voter who voted for Anthony, you took away a great moment from one of the greatest players in the game and voided him of an NBA record he undeniably deserved. Shame on you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-82096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SB 461 will provide up to nine units of financial aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In its current iteration, Senate Bill 461 (SB 461) will provide up to nine units of aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant, and would be valid for four-year students for two summer sessions, and valid to transfer students for one summer session.</p>\n<p>Generally, summer sessions are six weeks long, shorter than the standard 10 week quarter.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple changes this year, but it doesn’t have to do with the bill, it has to do with the climate,” Kuvimbinashe “Eddy” Chikukwa, chair for Coalition for a Better UC, said.</p>\n<p>He cited the election of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a reason for why the bill may pass this time.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom is] more favorable towards funding higher education… and really willing to reform the Cal Grant system in a way that we did not see last year.”</p>\n<p>Newsom, who previously sat on the UC Board of Regents, has been much more receptive to suggestions compared to former governor Jerry Brown, who had “a very antagonistic position with regards to the UC,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom] got to hear a lot of the complaints people had, and he got to hear a lot of the solutions people had regarding this issue… Gavin understands that you need to fund higher education so that students have adequate aid to get out faster.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the bill, students are pushing for a budget request to ensure that money is allocated specifically for summer aid.</p>\n<p>“Last year, a lot of people were hesitant to support it because if the bill were passed it would be drawn from the general fund, and there were concerns that this money could be taken from other students,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>SB 461 has drawn more support and grown a larger coalition of interest groups that are invested in reforming Cal Grant. The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is co-sponsoring the bill, while the CSU Chancellor’s Office and the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) are also in support of it.</p>\n<p>“There is also the will to reform Cal Grant. There is an actual desire which is evidenced by the recent assembly,” Chikukwa said, in reference to the joint legislative hearing chaired by California State Assembly Members José Medina and Kevin McCarty on Feb. 6, where “Closing the Degree Gap” was discussed.</p>\n<p>Regarding the necessity of summer aid for eligible students, Chikukwa noted the projected deficit of college graduates by 2030.</p>\n<p>“We’re acknowledging the fact that there’s a 1.1 million college graduate deficit that’s going to happen, we’re acknowledging the fact that low-income students tend to be the ones who don’t graduate on time, and we’re acknowledging the fact that we need more of these students to graduate faster.”</p>\n<p>Chikukwa also noted how S.T.E.M. students, who don’t necessarily always pass their major classes, often must resort to taking summer classes.</p>\n<p>Another issue which arises is that major classes during the year are often overenrolled.</p>\n<p>“So the state is making us enroll all these students into these courses and we don’t have space to put you in right now, so the best option is summer, and the state is making the UC do this and not providing summer aid, which is problematic,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>The bill has a long way to go, however.</p>\n<p>“We just introduced it, this is still the ‘hip hip hurrah’ phase.”</p>\n<p>In order to become law, SB 461 must make it through the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate floor. Then, after this, it must go through the California State Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, Chikukwa is optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It was really scrutinized heavily last year. A lot of people looked at it and they made their suggestions, and so this year I haven’t heard too many objections because the final objection last year was the lack of a budget request.

The coach from the soccer team (Tim Vom Steeg) was a student-athlete at one time and he was a Golden Eagle Award winner. Now he’s coaching and encouraging those kids. That feels good.”</p>\n<p>Golden Eagle recipients ranged in GPA from 3.30 to 3.96, with the average GPA at a 3.52. In addition, just one athlete from each men and women’s sport was represented, making it even more competitive.</p>\n<p>“We compliment the mission of UCSB, which is to be top-tier and special in all areas,” Athletic Director Mark Massari said. “Our student-athletes are reflecting that, and nights like tonight, we’re able to show it off.”</p>\n<p>Earning the highest honors of the night, the Golden Eagle Ring Award, were senior women’s basketball player Kirsten Tilleman and sophomore men’s volleyball player Jake Staahl. The golden Eagle Ring award is given to the female and male athlete with the highest overall GPA.</p>\n<p>Tilleman boasted the highest GPA of any student athlete at 3.96. Earning the honor for the second consecutive year as a graduate student, she studies in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Staahl, meanwhile, is a computer science major with an impressive 3.85 GPA.</p>\n<p>The complete list of winners include junior Kyle Boswell of the men’s basketball team (3.78 GPA), Tilleman of the women’s basketball team (3.96 GPA), senior Courtney Lightfoot of the women’s cross country team (3.30 GPA), senior Andre Grandt of the men’s soccer team (3.48), senior Erin Ortega of the women’s soccer team (3.41 GPA), junior Andriana Collins of the softball team (3.59), senior Andrew Latimer of the men’s swim and dive team (3.33 GPA), junior Anne Peanasky of the women’s swim and dive team (3.69 GPA), senior Benjamin Recknagel of the men’s tennis team (3.45 GPA), senior Erica Cano of the women’s tennis team (3.31 GPA), junior Winton Nguyen of the men’s track and field team (3.53 GPA), senior Helena Montin of the women’s track and field team (3.40 GPA), Staahl of the men’s volleyball team (3.85 GPA), senior Erica Lau of the women’s volleyball team (3.53 GPA), junior Matt Gronow of the men’s water polo team (3.32 GPA) and senior Rachel Nelson of the women’s water polo team (3.92 GPA).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1905358072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51377\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51378\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/ucsb-student-athletes-honored-at-golden-eagle-ceremony/golden-eagle/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=4320%2C3240&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4320,3240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"VLUU WB210, SAMSUNG WB210\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1368475436\",\"copyright\":\"COPYRIGHT, 2010\",\"focal_length\":\"7.7\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0222222222222\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Golden Eagle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51378\" alt=\"Golden Eagle\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle-250x187.jpg?resize=250%2C187\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 14, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Kristen Henneman</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Similarly, having Derrick Rose on your team won’t guarantee you a win either.</p>\n<p>It’s been over a year since Rose tore up his knee in last year’s postseason. Yet, the Bulls have managed the entire season without him and are in just as good of a position right now compared to if he were in the lineup. Cleared by doctors to play two months ago, the lingering question remains: Why hasn’t he stepped on the court yet?</p>\n<p>In sports, we’re constantly reminded of the heroism that comes with playing injured. Images of a hobbling Willis Reed walking onto the court with a torn thigh muscle in game seven or Michael Jordan scoring 38 points while playing with a 103 degree fever in the NBA Finals will forever remain etched in basketball lore. However, Rose and the Bulls have taken a completely different approach to handling their situation, and that is to sit and wait until Rose is completely ready.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skeptics argue that Rose is being selfish and putting himself before the team. With teammates like Joakim Noah battling with plantar fasciitis and still willing the Bulls to the semis, Rose’s toughness and dedication has been questioned.</p>\n<p>But what Rose is doing is the right choice not just for himself but also for the Bulls organization. For a player that is only 24 years old, there is no need for him to risk coming back from a career threatening-injury for a slim chance of defeating the Heat in a seven-game series. Let’s face it, the Bulls caught Miami by surprise in game one, but don’t count on that happening again.</p>\n<p>With the year Adrian Peterson had still fresh in our minds, it’s difficult to remember the numerous instances where other athletes never recovered from this injury, such as Olympian Michael Redd, who had his career cut short because of the ACL tear he suffered.</p>\n<p>The underlying issue here is not whether Rose is physically ready to play but whether he is mentally prepared to take the court. A player cannot be effective if he doesn’t trust his own knee to make sharp cuts and is repeatedly fearful of re-injury. The real topic of concern here with Rose is when he will finally be ready to get past that final mental hurdle; obviously, he still isn’t there yet.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget what the other Bulls players have done in the playoffs either. While the basketball world was shocked that the Bulls went into Miami with one day of rest after defeating the Nets in seven games, the Bulls, on the other hand, were not surprised at all. They expected to win.</p>\n<p>Noah and Jimmy Butler combined for 34 points with 25 rebounds in game one, and Nate Robinson filled the role of the go-to guy for Chicago, scoring 27 points on 50 percent shooting. Chicago stuck to its game plan, and that is to play physically against an undersized Heat front court. They finished with a 46-32 advantage on the boards and outscored Miami 40-32 in the paint. If the Bulls continue to do this throughout the series, James and company will have to wait for ring number two until next year.</p>\n<p>Miami has much more to worry about than wondering if Rose will come back and play in the series because in all likelihood, Rose probably will not see any action in this round of the playoffs or for the rest of the postseason. However, when he does come back, all eyes will be on him and his knee.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/","id":3207,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3206,3205,3204],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
