A County Redevelopment Agency planned to build a new space soon after, but the agency was later dissolved entirely due to financial setbacks.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2012, the County of Santa Barbara acquired a former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, bringing the fight for a community center back to the very heart of I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The location is adjacent to the Community Resource Building, Anisq’Oyo’ Park, the I.V. Food Co-Op and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks Department, a few historical tenants of community organization in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 Community Development Block Grant in 2015 to refurbish the former church building, the building seemed to be in promising hands.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Office of External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) held a launch party last October to celebrate the future renovations, and local groups began using the facilities for informal events.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Friends of the Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC), a group that has been meeting regularly for two years, began working with the budget to hire an architecture firm, create a single bathroom facility and refurbish a simple kitchen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The money has since dwindled down, and the county funding is all used up, bringing organizers to a $100,000 deficit. While the infrastructure additions are a huge step up for several Isla Vistans, others are unimpressed with the community center’s finances and longevity.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We’re putting money into building a warehouse in Isla Vista,” Lanny Ebenstein, longtime I.V. resident and professor of economics at UCSB, said at a meeting during the summer. The building is functional, but Ebenstein said the concrete flooring, limited lighting and versatility will make it an inappropriate central gathering space.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“For programming to be effective, you have to have a facility that people want to use,” he said. “The project that’s coming out, it’s probably the worst I’ve seen in my years of public planning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Skip Grey, county representative for the IVCC and a member of a county ad-hoc committee, said the goal during initial construction was to build a “shell” that could be used minimally. “We had the money so we wanted to build as much as we could,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The shell has purposed small group meetings, including gatherings for teens and families who live in I.V. Paola Dela Cruz, board member for the I.V. Recreation and Park District, said these sessions have been a very constructive step up from meetings at other venues.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think we’ve been trying really hard,” she said. “We need a central space that is not just for students, not just paid for by students, but for everyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVCC is working with The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) which is currently the only nonprofit servicing I.V. ventures. Together, they plan to launch a capital campaign to raise funding to make up for their current deficit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72545\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72545\" data-attachment-id=\"72545\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/comm-cen-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1328&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1328\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"comm-cen-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72545\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"Courtesy photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/COMM-CEN-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They have broad plans to utilize the space, including several additions that could far surpass their budget. A commercial kitchen, for example, could cost as much as $700,000. Removal of toxic adhesive underneath the current carpeting, a necessary process, will require $40,000.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flooring options, which may also become a necessity, range from $12,000 to $38,000 based on material, and wood, the most appealing option, is also the most expensive.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The community center received Planning Commission approval for C-2 Zoning on Aug. 31, however, which creates much for flexibility in further plans. The zoning also puts it in the same category as business, professional and trade schools, amusement enterprises, indoor theater and non-residential child care center, among several options.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">IVCC members have ideas to bring yoga, computer literacy classes, music and dance socials, and more to a final community center, set to open in spring 2017. They hope the community center will be open 24 hours a day, but this is still a stretch for a county building that would traditionally have 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. open hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Santa Barbara County has not expressed interest in permanently managing the Community Center once it opens next year, but they will support the building in the first month of its operation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Throughout the discussion, debate and redone estimates, the community organizers resoundingly agree on one common factor.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Isla Vista needs a community center.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Weekly meetings will continue until the final opening, with the next meeting held on Thursday at 6 p.m. in the I.V. Clinic Community Resource Room.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Update: The latest meeting posting has been added to the article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/","id":4505,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4504,4503,4502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Takes on USC in Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a disappointing 0-3 performance against Cal Poly on the road this past weekend, the UCSB baseball team returns home for a non-conference, solo-game series against USC.

The Gauchos have lost eight of their past nine games, six of which were lost on the road and all of which were Big West Conference series.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos all season has been junior outfielder Brett Vertigan, who currently ranks atop the league in batting average with a .381 mark and is No. 2 with a .448 on-base percentage and 83 hits.</p>\n<p>USC is led by senior infielder Matt Foat, No. 1 on the team with a .344 batting average. Foat’s .467 slugging percentage also leads the Trojans, and in the last meeting between the two teams, Foat was able to go two-for-five with one run.</p>\n<p>That mid-April meeting at USC saw what many assumed to be a game controlled by the Trojan defense. UCSB was led 4-1 through eight innings, yet was able to put together a run in the top of the ninth to tie the game and force extra innings.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the top of the 12th inning, a single by freshman infielder Peter Maris sent Vertigan across home plate, securing the win for UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB sent five different pitchers to the mound during the 12-inning game, including senior lefthander Kevin Gelinas, who opened the game’s first two innings by allowing no runs and tallying four strikeouts. Junior righthander Jared Wilson, who ranks No. 2 on the team with a 3.21 ERA, followed up by allowing two runs and four hits in 2.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Senior righthander Matt Vedo threw for two runs and one hit in two innings, while freshman righthander Dalton Douty allowed one hit in one inning and freshman lefthander Greg Mahle was credited with the win for his three-hit, four-strikeout performance in four innings.</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for 3 p.m. today at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47069\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-22/ucsb-takes-usc-final-home-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47069\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-22/ucsb-takes-usc-final-home-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-22/ucsb-takes-usc-final-home-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-22/ucsb-takes-usc-final-home-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-22/ucsb-takes-usc-final-home-game/","id":4502,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4501,4500,4499],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Overpowered by No. 12 Bruins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8467.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8467.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1","description":"In a matchup against No. 12 UCLA, the UCSB baseball team fell 12-3, giving up 11 hits compared to just four for the Gauchos.

After a leadoff walk, freshman second baseman Trent Chatterton faked a bunt and pulled back for a swing to hit a single. After a sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, a ground ball to shortstop by junior centerfielder Brian Carroll scored the first run of the game. Carroll’s RBI was followed by an RBI double by sophomore third baseman Kevin Kramer.</p>\n<p>In the top of the fifth inning, UCLA went back to the same formula to manufacture two more runs. The Gauchos responded with two runs of their own in the bottom of the fifth inning. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward led the inning off by reaching base after being hit by a pitch. He advanced to second on a ground ball and scored on a single by sophomore left fielder Luke Swenson. Swenson advanced to second on a groundout and scored when junior catcher Jackson Morrow grounded a 0-2 pitch to the second baseman Chatterton, who let the ball get through his legs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the sixth, the Bruins ran away with the game, scoring seven runs on four hits and an error by Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kenny Chapman replaced Mahle and quickly loaded the bases without recording an out. Freshman Domenic Mazza then came out of the bullpen to pick up for Chapman. Mazza fielded a grounder and recorded the out by going to the plate with the ball, but Morrow was unable to turn two after the runner’s slide disrupted his throw.</p>\n<p>Moore then doubled down the right field line driving in two runs. Head Coach Andrew Checketts again went to his bullpen, bringing on freshman Connor Baits. Baits was touched up by Chatterton with an RBI single and a two-run double off the bat of Filia. After a walk and hit batter, a sac fly to center field turned into two runs when the throw got away from Morrow and Baits.</p>\n<p>“Mahle gave us a competitive start, but the guys after that did not give us a chance,” Checketts said. “We are going to have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what was going on, but frankly it was embarrassing the way the young guys responded.”</p>\n<p>Both teams would go on to score another run apiece leading to the final score of 12-3 after several players replaced the starters by the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is another home weekend series against San Jose State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo by Mark Brocher / Daily Nexus</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/gauchos-overpowered-by-no-12-bruins/","id":4503,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4502,4501,4500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Homeless Students Get Access to Showers","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4776_3.jpg?resize=300%2C201&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4776_3.jpg?resize=300%2C201&ssl=1","description":"Gov.

Jerry Brown signed into motion Friday a bill to give homeless students access to shower facilities on community college campuses.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 1995 (AB 1995), authored by Assemblymember Das Williams, will become effective Jan. 1, 2017, permitting homeless students to use these facilities. The bill also establishes an office to keep records, conduct outreach and maintain the program.</p>\n<p>The bill outlines that the use of the shower facilities for homeless students must be scheduled to not interrupt campus gym hours, and can only be used for two hours per weekday. AB 1995 also requires the college to maintain records of the student enrollment in the program and to reach out to homeless students on each campus.</p>\n<p>Existing law allows students to apply for waived enrollment fees when enrolling in community college. AB 1995 will require the waiver applications to include a question asking whether the applicant is homeless, beginning at the start of the 2017-2018 academic year.</p>\n<p>Data from the 2015 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) shows that approximately 58,000 college students are homeless nationwide. The County of Santa Barbara contains one of the highest percentages of homeless students in California at 11 percent (second only to Trinity County at 13 percent).</p>\n<p>Many local attempts have been made to alleviate this issue. Santa Barbara City College, for example, offers a wide array of services for students facing food insecurity and homelessness.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams worked closely with the bill since he was a homeless student himself. When he attended community college two decades ago, he lived in a vehicle and showered at the beach until he transferred to UC Berkeley.<br>\nIn an <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2016/sep/23/community-college-shower-access-bill-empowers-home/\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed</a> article submitted to the Santa Barbara Independent, Williams said he believes hygiene and appearance is a large part of being present in school.</p>\n<p>“This bill removes a major obstacle to attending class for some people,” Williams said in a press statement Friday. “Students won’t have to skip class because of personal insecurities or fear about class acceptance if they are able to shower on campus.”</p>\n<p>By imposing a state-mandated local program, Williams said the bill is trying to get the community active in revitalizing the lives of students.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, this bill would not have been introduced without the Student Senate for California Community Colleges (SSCCC) lobbying for it since it was introduced in February.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/homeless-students-get-access-to-showers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/homeless-students-get-access-to-showers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/homeless-students-get-access-to-showers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/homeless-students-get-access-to-showers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/homeless-students-get-access-to-showers/","id":4504,"author":{"id":247,"name":"Brian Baek"},"related":[4503,4502,4501],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
