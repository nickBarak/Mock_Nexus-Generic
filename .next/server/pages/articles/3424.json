Nestled in the Central Coast, Isla Vista is only a short drive from iconic surf locales like Rincon, Emma Wood, C Street and Jalama, while also boasting its own local gems like Sands and Devereux. The easy access of some of the best surf spots on the West Coast is one of the primary reasons fourth-year Surf Team members DaniRose Hill and Jessica Bixby chose UCSB over schools like UC Berkeley, where they were both accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think just coming to Santa Barbara, and feeling how welcoming this community was, has to do with how close we are to the water,” Bixby explained. “I knew that my soccer career was coming to an end, so when I was visiting schools I was like, ‘I could start surfing all the time if I went here.’ So I think that a huge factor for me was like I can be in the ocean all the time in Santa Barbara.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The water is what keeps me mentally balanced and happy, and I knew that I wanted to be around it,” Hill added.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I.V. may seem to be a haven to those who share a love of the ocean, struggles for female surfers lurk just below the surface. Kaira Wallace, co-captain of the UCSB Surf Team, noted that sexism runs rampant — even in a tight-knit community so focused on positivity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Sexism] comes in different forms. Men will paddle by you and be like, ‘Oh, getting any waves?’ and you’re like, ‘Yes, I’m getting waves. Did you ask this man over here if he was getting any waves?’” Wallace said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like you definitely have to prove yourself a little bit more. Every time I go out I like thinking in my head like, ‘Don’t fuck up.’ Cause if someone’s easy to fuck up then they’re not going to take you seriously,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lily Day, a fourth-year Surf Team member agrees. “I feel like you really have to earn your place. You’re marked from when you first paddle out. The first wave is so important, because if I fall or eat shit, then all the guys know they can drop in on my waves, or won’t respect me,” Day said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gender barrier didn’t completely dissipate within the confines of the team. Even outside the water, gender roles in years past caused tension amongst team members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a tendency for some older guys on the team to have the position and kind of play the mascot in this role, of getting to do the fun things and shout into a megaphone and kind of get all of the credit,” Hill noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But behind the scenes they weren’t running any of the logistics and a lot of the girls for a lot of years had the job of being the bitch. We were the ones that were pestering people and getting things done and kind of doing all the grunt work that isn’t fun and doesn’t make you likable,” she said frankly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gendered aspect of the sport is nothing new to the women. Growing up, all of them faced similar experiences of discrimination on the basis of sex. It certainly didn’t help that by the time they reached high school, the number of female surfers dwindled to a number you could count on one hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As soon as you got into the high school surf team there was like maybe one or two other girls on the team tops,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though they constantly found themselves outnumbered during their formative years, the women all held out hope for a more female future in the sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some ways it was a lot harder to build confidence because I wasn’t doing it alongside other girls. I always knew that I was like standing alone and navigating it alone, despite guy friends that I had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t feel like I had that pack to lean on. I didn’t have other girls to look up to to go, ‘Oh, I can surf like that one day.’ I could only find that really through the media. But in another way, at times, I derive confidence from it just because I knew that one day there would be more girls, you know, if those few people that are on the team don’t keep surfing, then there will be no foundation for more girls.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the negativity, both Bixby and Hill recall their late mentors — Bixby’s father Mark and Hill’s coach Stan Searfus — both of whom helped normalize women in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first time I really felt my gender in the water, my mentor Stan saw how excited I was to surf. He invited me on a six-mile paddle and I was the only girl there. And some of the guys were kind of surprised that I showed up. There was classic boy banter. I wasn’t supposed to hear it but one of them said, ‘What is she doing here?’ Stan went up to them and said, ‘Well she’s out here, she’s doing this paddle and she’s going to be surfing with us, so get used to it,’ and that was so foundational to me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the women, the UCSB Surf Team proved a massive improvement, boasting a whopping five women their freshman year. It has since grown to more than 20. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think each year it’s just more exciting. Getting to college, I remember even being so stoked to be on a team with like five girls — that was mind blowing. And then the next year it was 12 girls at a competition all surfing together, like in the water dominating the lineup. Each year it’s increasing and it’s just makes you feel so much more comfortable in the water. People are more accepting and it’s more fun environment. Whereas I think when there’s too many men present, it just feels so competitive and like quiet. But I think women really liven up that environment,” Bixby concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the surf team has increased four-fold since Hill, Bixby and Wallace first joined the team in 2016, the fight for equality isn’t over yet. When asked to give advice to future generations of female surfers, Wallace doesn’t mince words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t take shit from any fucking guy out there. Do not take shit from him because you just like being in the water, you’ve overcome so much more than he ever will.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

Fullerton and Cal Poly do indeed reside at the bottom of the conference standings, but that just means they have more to play for. The worst team in the Big West misses the tournament entirely and the Titans and Mustangs both will do what it takes to avoid that fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, then, host two hungry teams this week. First up is Fullerton on Thursday night followed by Cal Poly on Saturday night, which will also serve as Senior Night for UCSB’s three departing players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB defeated Fullerton on Feb. 20 in a 75-66 game that saw the Gauchos come out hot, then blow the lead, and finally regain the advantage and close out the Titans with a 16-3 run. Senior guard Max Heidegger provided much of the spark for UCSB with 27 points, 7 rebounds 5 five assists and scored 16 of the team’s 41 second-half points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos likely won’t have Heidegger this time around. The senior left last Thursday’s game against UC Riverside early with an ankle injury that was serious enough to keep him out of Saturday’s game against UC Irvine as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB felt Heidegger’s absence in their loss to UC Irvine, shooting just 36.8% from the field with only one player scoring in the double digits. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin handled much of the scoring load when Heidegger missed 10 games earlier this season and will likely have to take on that role again if the Gauchos are to overcome the loss of their leading scorer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game was a tough first matchup to be without a player like Heidegger, but if the senior is indeed forced to miss more time with his injury, the competition this week promises to be a bit friendlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton is a middle-of-the-pack defensive team in the Big West, surrendering the fourth-most points per game while holding opponents to the fourth-lowest shooting percentage in the league. The Gauchos’ experience in their first matchup with the Titans bears out the statistical observations: UCSB shot a solid 45.6% from the field and scored 75 points, both fairly typical totals for the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On offense, Fullerton has two of the top five scorers in the Big West in senior guard Brandon Kamga and senior forward Jackson Rowe. Kamga and Rowe combined for 38 of the Titans’ 66 points in their first game against UCSB and will almost certainly be the Gauchos’ top defensive priorities once again on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton comes into Thursday’s game as losers of their last three games and have slid perilously close to last place Cal Poly in the Big West standings. UCSB, on the other hand, has won six of their last eight games, so the two teams enter Thursday’s game heading in opposite directions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can be said for Cal Poly and UCSB. The Mustangs have lost five games in a row heading into their matchup with the Gauchos, a losing streak that has kept them in the Big West cellar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Cal Poly opened up Big West play against each other all the way back on Jan. 8, so it’s only fitting that they’ll close their regular season against each other almost two months later. That first matchup was a 63-45 Gaucho victory, the team’s second-most lopsided win in conference play this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statistically speaking, there’s not much that Cal Poly does especially well. The Mustangs are near the bottom of the Big West in several categories, on offense and defense, and have surrendered over 80 points six times in conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs are especially weak on the boards, as opponents average 4.4 more rebounds a game than Cal Poly. That’s the worst mark in the Big West and UCSB will be eager to exploit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Heidegger is forced to miss Saturday’s game as well, it won’t be much of a change for the Gauchos when it comes to playing Cal Poly. The senior guard missed the Jan. 8 matchup as well, and while the team’s 63 points don’t scream success, the margin of victory suggests UCSB knows how to beat Cal Poly without their leading scorer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs have just one player averaging over 10 points per game: sophomore guard Junior Ballard. Ballard averages 12.8 points per game and shoots 36%  percent from three, enough to make him the primary focus for any team playing Cal Poly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Mustangs are able to reverse their slide and beat Long Beach State on Thursday night, they’ll come into the Thunderdome with a potential postseason bid on the line. If not, there won’t be much to play for, other than a shot at spoiling UCSB’s shot at second place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos host CSU Fullerton on Thursday night at 7 p.m. On Saturday night, the Gauchos host Cal Poly for Senior Night, also at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

400;\">Three-and-a-half games behind UC Irvine for first place in the Big West, a half-game ahead of UC Davis for second and with just four games left in the regular season, the name of the game now for the UC Santa Barbara men’s basketball team is protecting its seeding heading into the Big West Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winners of five of their last six games, the Gauchos appear poised to do just that. The team will have to learn from its early-season mistakes, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB entered Big West play on a similar roll, but saw a six-game winning streak melt away into a 2-4 conference record. These Gauchos know the importance of not coasting or resting on past success, and that their knowledge will be tested this week.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First up on the schedule is UC Riverside on the road on Thursday, followed by an away game at league-leader UC Irvine on Saturday. UCSB has already beaten both teams in close games at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside is 15-14 overall and 5-8 in conference play, which has the team second-to-last in the Big West. The Highlanders fell 65-63 to the Gauchos in a late January  thriller that saw senior guard Max Heidegger drill a go-ahead three with 2.9 seconds remaining in the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger  has been flying high as of late, along with his team. The senior won Big West Player of the Week honors for his play last week, as he averaged 22 points and 4.5 rebounds and assists per game in UCSB’s wins over Cal State Fullerton and UC Davis.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR has seen middling success overall, but they’ve been a different team at home. The Highlanders are 10-4  in the Student Recreation Center Arena in Riverside and fell just 4 points short of a home upset against UC Irvine earlier this month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They had Irvine beat,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “They were up 7 with about 4 points to go at home versus Irvine. They’re really good at home. We went there last year and got beat. It’s a tough place to play.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside plays at an agonizingly slow pace, the 12th slowest in the country according to Fox Sports, which helps explain its last-place position in the Big West for points per game and first-place position for points allowed per game. UCSB, however, isn’t much faster at 17th slowest in the country but yet still manages to be fourth in the conference in points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re the ninth-slowest team in our league [out of 9],” Pasternack  said. “They grind it out and it’s a grind every single game against them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big benches are often the province of up-tempo teams, but UCR bucks that trend with 12 out of 13 rostered players playing at least 10 minutes per game. UCSB, on the other hand, plays only nine of its 12 players double-digit minutes per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Highlanders don’t just have a big bench; they’ve got big players, too. Sophomore center Callum McRae is the biggest at 7’1”, but redshirt sophomore big-man Angus McWilliam  and redshirt junior forward Arinze Chidom both clock in at over 6’9” themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re a big, big team,” Pasternack  said. “They do a great job of game-planning and scouting […] We’re going to have to do a great job, all five players, of rebounding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat UCR’s size, Pasternack  plans to play Gaucho sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen at the same time on Thursday. That’s been a rare sight so far this season and could take some getting used to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB last faced UCR during a low point in their season, after losing three straight games in early Big West play. The Gauchos played from behind for almost all of that first game, but the team’s recent success suggests Thursday could be a different story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After UC Riverside, UCSB takes on UC Irvine in a marquee Big West matchup.  The crown jewel of the Gauchos’ current string of wins is a 64-61 victory over the Anteaters on Feb. 8,  a game Irvine likely hasn’t forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won that game despite blowing a 41-24 second-half lead in front of their home crowd. UCI roared back from the deficit to take a 58-55 lead late in the game, but the Gauchos managed to right the ship and close out their conference rivals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar performance on Saturday probably won’t cut it against a team that has been almost unbeatable on its home court. The Anteaters are 10-1 in Irvine, the one loss an upset at the hands of Cal Baptist early in the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conference play, UCI has lost to only UCSB and Long Beach State and has won its last four games heading into a Thursday matchup with last-place Cal Poly.  A win on Thursday will clinch the regular-season title for the Anteaters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI is second best in the Big West in points scored and points allowed per game, which is always a deadly combination. As the Feb. 8 game showed, the Anteaters’ overall strength means they’re never really out of contention in any game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters have three players averaging at least 12 points per game: redshirt sophomore forward Collin Welp, senior guard Evan Leonard and senior point guard Eyassu Worku. Welp averages 6 rebounds a game, while Worku  hands out a team-best 3.9 assists per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A win on Saturday will be a difficult task for the Gauchos, but they have already proved that they are capable of it this season. UCSB’s case will be greatly aided if the team manages to avoid another massive second-half collapse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beating UCR will help solidify the Gauchos’ second-place standing in the Big West and beating UCI will give the team a burst heading into the postseason. Two wins will send a strong message to the rest of the conference that this UCSB team is ready to play deep into March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos travel to Riverside to take on the Highlanders on Thursday at 7 p.m. and then swing over to Irvine to play the Anteaters on Saturday, also at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Clothing choice obviously isn’t the only barometer for school spirit, but the truth remains that some colleges and their students revel in the concept of an exclusive identity and the bonds that come with it far more than others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sense of community, of belonging, is often both reflected in and created by college sports.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to see this in the powerhouse schools across the country. Alabama’s football team literally brings together an entire city and surrounding areas on Saturdays to watch the game; Duke and the University of North Carolina have created metaphorical fortresses just 15 minutes away from each other with their men’s basketball teams; the University of Connecticut formed a women’s basketball empire that draws thousands of students to fill their arena just to watch their team on the big screen when they make it to March Madness. While how much of this is just young people wanting to fit in and get drunk on the weekends while watching the game and how much is a genuine feeling of community and school spirit (and just how different these two things are) is up for debate, there’s no doubt that these effects of sports on a college campus are very real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does this play out at a football-less mid-major school here at UCSB? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand this relationship between sports and how we form community as Gauchos now, we first have to look at how we did it in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the NCAA and college sports did not exist as both the financial and social institutions they are now in the early days of UCSB, our sports teams certainly did have a presence. Even as far as 70 years ago, the Nov. 16, 1945 edition of the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (then known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">El Gaucho</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) recapped our men’s basketball team’s 36-25 victory over the Marines by pointing out how our “capacity crowd” helped will the Gauchos to victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forty five years later, our basketball stadium earned its “Thunderdome” moniker because of how raucous the crowds were in our victory over the highly esteemed University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels. Students literally camped outside the ‘Dome the night before to wait in line for tickets, and footage from the inside on game day showed a crowd that almost makes the Cameron Crazies pale in comparison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This still holds true in the recent past. From 2000-2015, we hosted seven out of the top 10 highest attended regular season soccer games in NCAA history, won the NCAA College Cup and also hosted the UNC basketball team here at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over all these years UCSB built up a strong reputation nationwide as a “party school,” even without a football team for most of it. Students were able to mix the relative freedom and separation that Isla Vista offers with school spirit and community that is centered around our sports teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was not the UCSB I came to in the Fall 2016, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injuries, fatigue and just a lack of enthusiasm seemed to plague most of the sports teams my freshman year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our men’s basketball squad finished 6-22 and had some of the lowest attendance numbers in years; our men’s soccer team finished 10-7-3 and lost in their first match in the Big West tournament; our baseball team fresh off a remarkable College World Series run went 24-32 and weren’t even close to sniffing the postseason and although our women’s basketball team had a surprisingly good postseason run, they ultimately dropped the Big West Tournament championship game and ended with a 16-16 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really did feel like a fragmented campus in many ways. While people were able to find community on campus in other ways, whether it be through clubs, fraternities or just their dormmates, there was never really a time or place that I felt connected to the student body as a whole  other than our school-sanctioned concerts and one Blue-Green rivalry soccer game against Cal Poly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It only took one year, and a historic basketball season, for that to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When our men’s basketball team started off the 2017-18 season with a 9-2 record led by new Head Coach Joe Pasternack and star junior guard Max Heidegger, students began to get curious. It was my first year covering the team and when I interviewed Coach Pasternack in the preseason, he emphasized over and over again the importance of getting the campus involved with the team for the benefit of the students and the players. I thought he was being overly optimistic at the least and that perhaps spending so much time as a coach at the University of Arizona had skewed his perception, that it wasn’t really possible to bring people together here in the way he claimed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then students started to show up to the games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowly but surely attendance started rising, and our team became the talk of the town. I heard conversations about UCSB basketball in the dining commons, in class, even in random places I.V. It seemed as if people were just waiting for something to cheer for, for something or someone to rally around, for a way to express their pride in being a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ended up having the best home record and home crowd in the Big West, culminating with a packed house of 4,833 students in our season finale beatdown of Cal Poly. I remember looking up and seeing the packed stands that night, seeing everyone in blue and gold cheering on the team and thinking that this is what community feels like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, just a year later, we have the opportunity to make our own mark on UCSB sports history. Our men’s volleyball team reached as high as a No. 3 rank this season and packed Roberson Gym with eager fans during the games; our men’s basketball team again had an incredible season and actually saw attendance numbers rise; both tennis teams have been running through their competitions; our women’s water polo team was nationally ranked and our baseball team has put together the best season in program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sports renaissance has not just been great for sportswriters and stat-geeks like me but has also given incoming and continuing students a chance to go cheer our teams on and be a part of their success as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB might never be a sports powerhouse, while we might never get a football team or have tailgating opportunities, we’ve shown that we have the ability to find a sense of community in the teams we do have, and as long as our teams keep improving, so will our school spirit.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
