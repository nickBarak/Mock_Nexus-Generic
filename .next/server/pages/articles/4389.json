Gutierrez was assigned to IVFP because of his work as a detective in the Criminal Investigations Division for one year, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (CSD) recently considered hiring a specialized sexual assault detective for as much as $120,000.

Bertrand said IVFP was not meeting an adequate “service level” in addressing sexual assault issues prior to Gutierrez’s hire.</p>\n<p>UCSB students agreed last May when <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">over 100 students crowded Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office demanding a reform</a> of the way sexual assault cases were handled.</p>\n<p>Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student, said during the May sit-in that IVFP poorly handled her rape case. IVFP told her that they couldn’t respond to her allegations because it was out of their jurisdiction, Earwin said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand told the <em>Nexus </em>on Wednesday that the CSD will probably wait to hire a new detective until they decide whether sexual assault cases are now being handled properly.</p>\n<p>The CSD is also considering expanding UCSB’s CSO escort program to provide more service to I.V. during high traffic nights.</p>\n<p>The cost of the escort program expansion was originally $120,000 of UCSB’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\">annual $200,000 pledged to the CSD</a>. Bertrand said the cost of the program is likely closer to $45,000, creating room for a new hire.</p>\n<p>SBSO will continue to pay Gutierrez’s salary through the Criminal Investigations Division, the department from which he is transferring. <a href=\"http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2016/santa-barbara-county/julio-c-gutierrez/\">According to public records</a>, Julio Gutierrez received $206,711 in total pay and benefits in 2016.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78886\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78886\" data-attachment-id=\"78886\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/ivrpd-looks-to-fill-board-vacancy/detective11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=2048%2C1364&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1364\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Detective1(1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78886 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Detective11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julio Gutierrez (second from left) has specialized training in sexual assault cases. <em>Courtesy of Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>On the timing of Gutierrez’s appointment in relation to the CSD’s plans, Hoover said the Sheriff’s Office has wanted to create the assignment for “quite some time” but said she could not specify when the move was first considered and that SBSO has been “involved in all of these discussions” about public safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>IVFP is a partnership between sheriff’s deputies and UC Santa Barbara police officers (UCPD) created in 1971 that patrols I.V. on foot or bicycle.

City of Upland</i> case could be interpreted to allow citizens to bring a tax to the board.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tim Bittle, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and representative for representing Upland in the case, said his<b> </b>group filed a petition in Sept. to make sure the court’s decision did not “open the door to abuse” from local governments, considering how “confusing” the court’s opinion is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As of Tuesday night, the California Supreme Court has not clarified its decision. The deadline to respond to Bittle’s group is Nov. 26.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the court agrees with Trindle’s assessment, local governments would<b><i> </i></b>be able to bypass the two-thirds requirement for special taxes.<i> </i>For this to happen, citizens must create an ordinance, gather 10 percent of voters’ signatures and bring the proposal to the county for approval.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the county approves it, governments would either vote on the tax at a board meeting or an election with a smaller majority than normally required.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts are skeptical whether the court’s current ruling allows governments to leave some voters out of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The majority of I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board members have rejected the possible use of this legal quirk to pass a tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">George Thurlow, a board member, told the <i>Nexus</i> that he cannot take a position on the tax because of his position as both a UCSB employee and an elected official. He added that he has recused himself at every opportunity to discuss the tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Directors Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Bob Geis, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan have all said they disapprove of passing the tax through a vote of the board. Brandt called it “a very clear no.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Director Geis said he is in favor of a user utility tax, but it is not an issue for seven people to determine. He said that “if it’s not the will of the voters,” they would be very displeased with such a decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would say that we would want to, in any circumstances, bring it to the voters,” Geis said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In a third-party assessment of the case, the League of California Cities said local tax measures proposed by citizens should be open to the same requirements as those proposed by a local government. The group provided their review of the case to the courts in October of last year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The group recommended that cities in similar situations should “consult with their city attorney” due to the “lack of clarity” in the court’s decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts in the county are currently keeping an eye on the issue but have yet to analyze it in detail due to its tentative nature.</p>\n<p>Mike Ghizzoni, legal counsel for the county of Santa Barbara, said he has read the case and is monitoring it but will not provide analysis until the petition has been granted or denied and the case is finalized.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79004\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79004\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/","id":4387,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4386,4385,4384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What You Need to Know About I.V.

The I.V. community has witnessed several movements in favor of cityhood, but the state ultimately determined these efforts to be politically and financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury determined that a CSD would be the best option to represent the unincorporated community.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB-3) was introduced to the state assembly in 2014 and would effectively create a new government in I.V. capable of addressing the needs of the “transient student population” and its “predominantly renter-oriented” community.</p>\n<p>The bill also assigns the CSD powers to provide services related to infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. Governor Jerry Brown signed AB-3 into law on Oct. 7, 2015, paving the way for Measure E to be on the ballot in Nov. 2016.</p>\n<p>Measure E was the ballot measure to formally create the Isla Vista CSD and was coupled on the ballot with Measure F, a utility user tax meant to fund the district through an 8 percent tax on gas, water, electricity, sewage and garbage disposal for users in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>CSD Financial Strains</strong></p>\n<p>While most of the country focused on welcoming and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/over-1000-uc-santa-barbara-students-protest-in-isla-vista-after-trump-elected-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting</a> a new president on Nov. 9, 2016, I.V. residents also saw the birth of a new government by voting a resounding 87.52 percent “yes” on Measure E.</p>\n<p>The measure created the Isla Vista CSD with voters electing Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan as directors to lead the newly formed government.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman described the district as an “experiment” in providing small-scale government that has the “visceral” ability for students to become involved because of its relationship with UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Measure F, however, received 61.22 percent of the total vote in favor, failing to reach the two-third (66 percent) vote necessary to impose the tax. This effectively left the CSD fundless and with little ability to finance the services it wished to provide.</p>\n<p>The failure to pass this tax is worrisome for the future of the district, as AB-3 stipulates that “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand, however, remains confident in its future.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> Tuesday, Bertrand said there are plans to put the tax on the ballot once more in June or November of next year. He also said the district has received approximately $6,500 in funding from private donations, grants and contributions from Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Establishing Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The CSD held its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first meeting in March</a> and has been meeting every two weeks since then.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the district tries to make its meetings “as interactive as possible” because it works with all aspects of the community, including students, families and businesses.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of the beauty of a small government that we have the ability to kind of work directly with [the public],” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. now has two entities directly governing it: the Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), a small body established in 1972 to regulate parks and other outdoor spaces, and the CSD, a body with broader governing powers.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the administrative framework took a long time to build but said he feels the CSD is now “getting [its] wings” as it begins to provide services.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals of the CSD</strong></p>\n<p>According to Bertrand, public safety is “the top priority,” as the CSD is working with UCSB to acquire this year’s $200,000 in annual funding for the next seven years. The university <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pledged</a> this funding during the district’s creation for “mutually agreed-upon projects, programs and services.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he is in interested in “community-oriented policing services” rather than placing sworn officers on the streets. He said he believes this will solidify the relationship between residents and law enforcement and will contribute to a decline in the amount of sexual assault in I.V., which has<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/sexual-assault-reports-up-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> increased in recent years</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to that sum, the district is applying for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation, a local philanthropy, and acquired $3,000 from the Fund for Santa Barbara for “community programming.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the district plans to use the funds to schedule community meetings at the Community Conference Room in I.V., currently used for CSD meetings, and loan it to organizations interested in gathering there.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the room can only be used for noncommercial purposes but said the district will not focus on the content of the meetings that happen there. Managing the room’s scheduling would be the first service the CSD provides since its creation.</p>\n<p>The CSD created an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/new-csd-interns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internship program</a> in conjunction with UCSB’s political science department in Spring Quarter, employing five interns to-date, but has not yet provided large-scale services to I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The district’s ability to provide services has been bogged down significantly by its lack of funding, as well as its lack of structure, as it has spent several months drafting policies and developing procedures to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hopes</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSD continues to develop and find new funding sources for the services it intends to provide, its directors express optimism toward the newborn government’s future.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the CSD was created to make I.V. a safer place and to give the community the “long-deserved voice” within local government.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge step for participatory government in I.V.,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>“If you have any interest at all in how society operates, in how all of those services that you rely on everyday [are provided] … even if we’re not the ones providing to you, we are a model by which you can learn how government functions,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/what-you-need-to-know-about-i-v-government/","id":4388,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4387,4386,4385],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
