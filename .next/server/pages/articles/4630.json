Self-Governance Bill (AB 3), which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law on Wednesday, and funding for and I.V. Community Center. AB 3 aims to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives and supported by a Utility Users Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>Farr said it will be a “big job” to educate I.V. residents about how a CSD would affect them before they vote to approve it in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people get voter fatigue; they’ve got this enormous ballot, all this stuff to go through so hopefully [AB 3] doesn’t get lost in that,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr said she has heard concerns regarding funding for CSD administrative costs and services, and the role Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) would play in a CSD.</p>\n<p>Farr said a UUT, which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills, is a more effective method of dividing the costs of the CSD between students, long-time residents and property owners.</p>\n<p>“That was why they wanted the UUT rather than a property tax because the thought was that the tax burden is spread more evenly throughout the community that benefits, and not just on those people that own property,” said Farr. “Long-term owners are concerned that they are going to be saddled with enormous tax assessments.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, IVRPD was intentionally excluded from the CSD planning.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. Park and Rec District did not want to be folded into the CSD and that was why we thought the governor might not sign it, because he doesn’t like creating layers,” Farr said. “So it was specifically written to exclude IVRPD … we’ve got a good thing going, we don’t want to goof it up.”</p>\n<p>Professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said he has plans to raise funds for an Isla Vista Community Center that involve alumni and current students.</p>\n<p>“There are 190,000 alumni at UCSB and most of them have probably lived in Isla Vista,” Ebenstein said. “Only 15,000 people live here at a time, but over twenty or thirty years, 150,000 may have lived here.”</p>\n<p>According to Ebenstein, significant funds are still needed to build a community center.</p>\n<p>“$483,000 is a start, but it is not enough to do everything that should be done,” Ebenstein said. “Our goal would be to raise a million dollars … What we are trying to do is raise a million dollars more — that would be the funds that we think would be necessary to really make the community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Vista residents have begun campaigning for office in a college town on the brink of self-governance.</p>\n<p>Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan are the first to announce candidacy for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance\" target=\"_blank\">I.V. Community Service District</a> (CSD) board of supervisors, which will be put to a vote in November.</p>\n<p>The CSD is a proposed form of local government in I.V. with the ability to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>It will appear as Measure E on the November ballot and require a majority vote to pass. All candidates running for office as the board of directors will be listed on the ballot, along with a tax designed to partially fund the CSD.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which outlines specific powers for the I.V. CSD, states that the board of directors will have seven members — five directors elected at large, one director appointed by the county and one director appointed by UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang.</p>\n<p>Of the five elected board members, four directors must serve four-year terms and one director serves a two-year term. For the inaugural election in November, two four-year positions have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates.</p>\n<p>Freeman, who was the first to file for candidacy, is the founder of software company Cydia and a 16-year I.V. resident. He joined the race shortly after an unsuccessful run for Santa Barbara County Supervisor in June. He and Brandt are currently unopposed as the only candidates vying for the two four-year positions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"614444030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72077\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Freeman speaks at an Isla Vista stakeholders meeting in September.

You’re going to be under a lot of scrutiny.’”</p>\n<p>Abboud, Cameron Schunk and Darcél Elliott, three lead organizers of the self-governance movement, publicly endorsed Bertrand, Brandt, Hedges and Jordan on Friday. Assemblymember Das Williams, who wrote AB 3 has also endorsed Bertrand, Brandt, Hedges and Jordan, according to Elliott, his personal assistant.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58289\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"242964534\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72077\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58289\" data-attachment-id=\"58289\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/iv-self-governance-by-alex-nagase-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415896876\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Self Governance by Alex Nagase\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58289\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1-1024x681.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV-Self-Governance-by-Alex-Nagase1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58289\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Schunk and Abboud began pushing for I.V. self-governance while they were both attending UCSB in 2014. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Schunk said he, Abboud and Elliott helped the candidates coordinate their candidacy and chose them from a group of approximately 10 residents who expressed interest during an information session in July.</p>\n<p>“The most primary benefit of creating a slate of candidates like this is giving people the opportunity to start working together now so that, when they’re elected to the board, they’ve already formed that cohesion,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, he and the other organizers interviewed at least nine potential candidates and decided to support Bertrand, Brandt, Jordan and Hedges for being the “most qualified” and “most well-connected” candidates.

His first assignment was in October 2015 when AB 3 was signed into law. From then on, he said he picked up as many assignments as possible for the Tuesday night meetings.</p>\n<p>“These outreach meetings are a large reason why I decided to run in the first place,” Brandt said in an email. He said he is running for a four-year term, the longest term-length possible in this race, so he can “ensure that there is a precedent set for student representation and participation on the board.”</p>\n<p>Jordan, third-year history of public policy major, recently won the race for Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President. She said she offers a role on the CSD board of directors as someone who can “facilitate the partnership” between the CSD and the University. In her first year at UCSB, Jordan also served as A.S. Off-Campus Senator.</p>\n<p>“I want to bring to the table the students and residents of Isla Vista who are not often normally politically engaged,” Jordan said in an email. “They will need to be part of the solution if we want the CSD to be widely successful.”</p>\n<p>Hedges is a local pastor and volunteer chaplain for the I.V. Foot Patrol and has lived in I.V. since he first arrived in 1968 as a UCSB student. He is running for the director position because he “got drafted” by other community members, he said.</p>\n<p>“I responded favorably to that because I believe in what is being done with the Community Services District,” he said. After living in I.V. for 48 years, he said he has been in a “unique position” to have observed and been “right in the middle of” much of I.V. history.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time I have heard a strategy that really moves this community forward toward identity and a voice,” he said. “It may not have been time for [the CSD] decades ago, but it is time now.”</p>\n<p>The four new candidates will be officially registered with the county elections office after finishing paperwork due August 12, according to Hector Gonzalez-Loera, the Santa Barbara County elections supervisor. Prior to dropping out, Covolo was the only candidate that had filed completely, Gonzalez-Loera said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/","id":4627,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4626,4625,4624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joel Ruiz Suspends Candidacy for I.V.

If Isla Vistans approve Measures E and F in November, the local government will have the ability to improve infrastructure and institute community policing amongst several other functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 3 outlines that the CSD board of directors is made up of seven members, five of whom are elected at large. These five elected members are to have differing term lengths: four directors serve for four years and one director serves for two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For only the inaugural election, however, two of the four-year members will serve for just two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">declared candidacy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August, days before the filing deadline, to run against Bertrand for the single, permanent, two-year seat.

When I filed, I was filing because I didn’t want to miss the filing deadline,” he said. “I didn’t want to have to regret not filing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to attain multiple endorsements or funds, Ruiz said he considered suspending the campaign early in the race. He said he needed the convincing of his campaign manager, Alejandra Melgoza, who sought election as Associated Students President last spring, to finally make the decision Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not someone who quits easily,” he said. “It was really hard for me to accept it, to come to terms with the reality of it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz is not the first candidate to leave the CSD race. Clark Covolo decided a week before the August filing deadline that he would drop out, opting to run for the IVRPD board instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Covolo, however, Ruiz is unable to withdraw his name from the November ballot, despite his decision to halt active campaigning.

He will also be promoting his CSD “running mates” Natalie Jordan, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Spencer Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he commends Ruiz for his “interest in improving Isla Vista” and will continue to advocate for the Latino community as Ruiz did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have and I will continue to be a voice for those segments of the community, especially for those who are underserved and underrepresented,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he does not yet want to throw his support behind any specific candidate, Ruiz said he is “happy” for Bertrand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sure he’ll do fine,” Ruiz said. “Hopefully he serves the community and has its best interests at heart.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates for the temporary two-year positions still face active competition.

UCPD works alongside IVFP to represent the university’s interest in matters of law and safety in I.V. while also patrolling the approximately 1,000 acres of UCSB’s campus, maintaining 24-hour uniformed patrol and police response.</p>\n<p>IVFP Sergeant Daniel Calderon said UCPD officers and IVFP deputies have similar duties and often rotate roles.</p>\n<p>“We all have the same peace officers powers of the state,” Calderon said. “It is just that those officers that are assigned to the campus only work on the campus during that time period. Isla Vista, this particular community, is an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, so [IVFP] handles all of the emergency calls for service.”</p>\n<p>There are currently seven officers from UCPD both patrolling campus and working in I.V. alongside IVFP, according to UCPD Sergeant Robert Romero.</p>\n<p>“That is on a rotational basis, so once every year and a half, two years, an officer will leave the campus patrol station and go work eight months to a year out at Isla Vista,” Romero said. “They are the ones that are really the heart and soul of the department.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP responds to crimes such as burglary, theft, battery and assault, but not traffic accidents, which fall under the California Highway Patrol’s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“We don’t handle the traffic enforcement out here — that is still Highway Patrol — they’re still responsible for handling traffic accident investigations, things like that,” Calderon said. “But we can still pull people over — issue citations for speeding, stop signs we can still make arrests for drunk driving and things like that — it is just that that is not necessarily our primary duty.”</p>\n<p>UCPD’s campus jurisdiction includes lecture halls and university housing in I.V., according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>“All of the buildings that they own that surround Isla Vista, all of the student housing, the faculty housing and [family] student housing, all of the new construction projects that you see — that is all UC property,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD hosts safety presentations for students, especially those living in residence halls, and collaborates with them on solutions to solve public safety issues.</p>\n<p>“We go to different functions that residential life might be putting on,” Romero said. “These interactions we have with students is, basically, we talk to them about things on how to be safe and they talk to us about what they like, what they don’t like from their police department. So it is an exchange of ideas and how to come up with a better plan on how to keep the community safe.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said any student or I.V. resident can join IVFP deputies on a walk-along to experience a day in the life of an officer.</p>\n<p>“From a UCSB student’s perspective, there is just a bunch of cops walking around. Do you know what they are doing?” Calderon said. “That is why I encourage people to do walk-alongs so they can kind of see and point out the problems that we try to tell people about.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, IVFP deputies are trained to use “tactical communication” skills when dealing with “chaotic” scenarios.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say I’m working Del Playa on a Saturday night. It’s really busy and if I went into a party or I went into a fight and people are yelling and it’s a very chaotic, rapidly evolving scene, it is not going to benefit me and it’s not going to benefit my partners if I go in there and start yelling at people,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said newly hired UCPD officers undergo field training alongside an experienced officer.</p>\n<p>“When they get hired they are on a field training program,” Romero said. “Besides learning how to do a proper car stop, how to search somebody properly, how to place somebody into custody, we also teach them how to interact with our community, things to look for, how to be an active listener.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP intervenes when necessary to keep students and I.V. residents safe.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to make sure that everybody enjoys their time here out in Isla Vista and we know that they are away from home and a lot of people are away from home for the first time,” Calderon said. “It is not our greatest goal just to write people tickets for open containers of alcohol.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, deputies prosecute people for wrong-doings to prevent them from repeatedly acting out.</p>\n<p>“We try to prosecute that person because what we found is that when people do that to somebody — when they harm them physically, sexually assault them, that kind of thing — that almost empowers them to where they think that they can do it again and keep doing it in our community,” Calderon said. “That is why we have these people who are repeat offenders.”</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD looks to hire officers who are community oriented.</p>\n<p>“We try to hire people here at the police department that are customer service oriented, community oriented. And when we are doing the hiring process, even some of the interview questions for getting a job here at the police department, we ask them about how do you feel about community-organized policing, can you define it for us, what does it mean to you?” Romero said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP seeks to hire “mature” and experienced individuals as deputies.</p>\n<p>“I started this business when I was little bit older, I had already had another career completely. I started this in 2002; I came on board with the Sheriff’s office but I had already done some other things,” Calderon said. “Essentially we want to make sure that the officers and deputies assigned here are mature.”</p>\n<p>Romero said Community Service Organization (CSO) student officers also work alongside UCPD and help with campus security, patrolling campus buildings, sports games and entertainment events.</p>\n<p>“They do a fabulous job of going into the community, because their peers are the students,” Romero said. “They also are an extra pair of eyes and ears for any trouble that is going on in the university campus or Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Romero said the number of officers at the UCPD station, which includes an investigation unit and dispatch center, will likely soon increase.</p>\n<p>“Currently we have 36 sworn police officers, however, that number is going to grow probably another 10 here in the near future,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Mable Truong said she did not know the difference between IVFP and UCPD, and previously was not aware of the CSO program.</p>\n<p>“I would be one of the people that are confused,” Truong said. “I think I have an idea of what they do — they are the people that bring you around at night … then I just saw them last night so I thought that was really cool, and they seem really friendly, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Elizabeth Del Rincon said she feels safer on campus and in I.V. with a visible police presence.</p>\n<p>“Just if something bad were to happen, I feel like they would be there to go and help,” Del Rincon said.</p>\n<p>Del Rincon said she believes it is important for officers to receive training on how to work with students.</p>\n<p>“They are around students all the time so I feel like if they were to receive training it would be better,” Del Rincon said. “I see them especially at night escorting people to their dorms and stuff and I think that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Jill Allen said the CSO escort program is helpful and allows students to feel safer.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel safer trying to walk from one end, especially to walk from the Chem building to I.V. in the dark. It’s not so fun,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, UCPD and IVFP work together without overstepping boundaries.</p>\n<p>“It is two different jurisdictions, but in other words, we work very closely. We don’t step on each other’s toes,” Calderon said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/","id":4629,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4628,4627,4626],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
