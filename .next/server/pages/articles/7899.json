In February of this year, Baked By Ber went live and began to provide fresh cookies to the citizens of Isla Vista. Baked By Ber is an online bakery owned by one of our very own Gauchos, Amber Jorgensen. As a fourth-year biochemistry major, she manages this online bakery and fulfills orders while maintaining her studies. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91200\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91200\" data-attachment-id=\"91200\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/img_6418/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_6418\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-91200\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6418.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-91200\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Amber Jorgensen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jorgensen began baking in her freshman year of high school. Since she lived in a town with nowhere to buy good sweets, she decided to bake them on her own. Occasionally, she would post pictures of her treats on her Instagram account (@chefamb) where she received many comments encouraging her to open up a bakery. Instead, on New Year’s Eve of 2018, she decided to start up a website to sell her cookies. The next day, she went on the Santa Barbara health department website to apply for a Cottage Food Operations permit and was granted permission a week later. She began to build her website and practice recipes for her website’s “grand opening” in February of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bakery was first launched, Jorgensen received a lot of orders during the first weekend which proved to be difficult to manage. As she recalls, “I didn’t even have a stand mixer at the time so I was doing everything by hand … my biceps were sore all the time. I stayed up super late every night that weekend just getting everyone’s orders done and didn’t go out or do anything else.” As a biochemistry student, Jorgensen can find it tough to balance her workloads of an online bakery and academics. However, she conquered this challenge by learning how to efficiently manage her time by consistently planning out her next day’s schedule in order to keep herself accountable. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The s’mookie was an amazing experience. Jorgensen successfully takes the idea of s’mores and creatively makes a cookie out of it. I was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the cookie since it wasn’t chewy like a regular cookie but crumbly, imitating the graham cracker part of a s’more. The double chocolate cookie was just as Jorgensen described it to be —  rich and indulgent. She sprinkles on sea salt to counteract the sweetness that would typically come with a double-chocolate dessert, making this cookie a perfect amount of sweet. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was interesting, since it was my first time trying a vegan cookie. Due to the different ingredients used, the cookie had a slightly different taste than regular chocolate chip cookies. Nevertheless, the cookie still tasted amazing. Lastly, the gooey confetti cookie was my personal favorite. It was soft, chewy and thick, and it just melted in my mouth. The cookie was topped with confectioners’ sugar, which paired perfectly. The cookies were wonderfully delicious, and I strongly recommend sending an order in ASAP!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orders are usually completed within a week, and they are available for pickup or delivery (the latter for an extra charge) in I.V. You can change the ingredients to fit your dietary needs and/or cravings. However, if you are in need of an immediate sugar fix, you can now stop by Campus Point Coffee to grab one of Baked By Ber’s cookies!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel free to check out her Facebook page (@Baked By Ber) and Instagram account (@bakedbyber) to get updates on newly released cookie flavors!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91198\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91198\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/baked-by-ber-the-best-bakery-in-town/","id":7899,"author":{"id":846,"name":"Michelle Wan"},"related":null,"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":846,"name":"Michelle Wan","biography":"Not available","articles":[6495,7899,8074],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
