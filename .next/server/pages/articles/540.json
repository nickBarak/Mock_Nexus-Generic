They do remain a half game up on the Highlanders, which improved to 6-19 overall and 1-10 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara takes the loss, the team actually owned the lead the majority of the game. After a 9-0 run late in the first half, UCSB extended its lead to 10 points at 37-27 with 13:23 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, it was all Riverside. A three by the Highlander’s leading scorer and sophomore guard Brittany Crain capped off an 11-0 run for UCR, giving the team its first lead since midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos couldn’t stop the bleeding as Riverside extended the run to 28-7, putting Santa Barbara in an 11-point hole with little time left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“They got after us more on the defensive end. They started trying to deny Nic and [senior guard Melissa Zornig], so it made it tough for us to run patterns. It’s human nature when that happens to go into panic mode and we had the wrong people taking shots late in the shot clock,” Mitchell said. “We’re too late in the year. We have to understand who the offense needs to go to and through and then be able to get stops on the other end.”</p>\n<p>Despite a solid first half, holding the Highlanders to 19 points, UCSB gave up 48 second half points as it was outscored 48-33.</p>\n<p>On the game, UCSB didn’t shoot well, shooting 34.4 percent from the field. Riverside’s offense, on the other hand, resembled its attack from last Saturday when the team shot 53.8 percent from the field, defeating UC Irvine for its first conference victory. Tonight, the Highlanders shot an incredible 56 percent from the field in the second half.</p>\n<p>“They were knocking down shots,” Nesbit said. “Everything that they were putting up it seemed like was going in and with that comes lots of energy and momentum. Once they started to get hot, everyone started to bring tons of energy.”</p>\n<p>Crain led UCR offensively, recording a double-double with 28 points and 11 rebounds. Freshman guard Simone DeCoud also stepped up with 18 points. During Riverside’s 28-7 run in the second half, the two combined for 22 of the 28 points.</p>\n<p>“You have Brittany Crain, who’s the leading scorer in the Big West, and we’re not matched up with her in transition defense or we had our five player guarding her,” Mitchell said. “That tells me there’s a lack of focus or in transition we didn’t communicate because she got two or three open threes with our five player guarding her.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the seniors led the way once again. Both Nesbit and senior guard Melissa Zornig finished with 16 points while senior guard Destini Mason added 11 points.</p>\n<p>“The kids read the internet. They understand our record,” Mitchell said. “With this team, it’s probably a little more pressure than they handle. We need to focus on what we need to do and hope it will lead to a couple wins in the final five games of the season.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to regroup quickly for Saturday’s game at Cal State Fullerton. Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. at Titan Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-falls-to-last-place-uc-riverside/","id":540,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[539,538,537],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Faces UCR With Postseason on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-3_Vandendelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Riverside in a game that could determine which team receives the final spot in the Big West Tournament.

There are always seniors on another team that sometimes aren’t looking at the record,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They’re trying to extend their playing careers and go out on a good note. I know we’re probably going to get their best game, no doubt about it, especially since they were our first conference win.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the matchup in eighth place at 2-8 in conference and 7-16 overall. The Highlanders are currently in the cellar of the Big West standings at 1-10 in league and 5-19 overall. With only the top eight teams going to playoffs, this game could have serious postseason implications.</p>\n<p>All season, consistency has been the biggest problem for UCSB. Even this past weekend, the Gauchos beat Long Beach in a nearly flawless game, scoring a season-high 80 points while forcing the 49ers into 22 turnovers before falling in blowout fashion to Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on putting two games together. We know that we can be a spectacular team one night and not so good another night,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re trying to limit those highs and lows and continue to be positive and use the momentum to make good things happen. For us, it’s going to be about putting two games together, especially on the road.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the Long Beach game, Santa Barbara fell behind early against the Matadors and could never recover. The Gauchos were also dominated on the boards as Northridge outrebounded UCSB 55-28.</p>\n<p>As a result, the focus this week for UCSB was rebounding. In fact, in the Gauchos’ first conference victory this year when they beat Riverside 74-61 in the Thunderdome, Santa Barbara won the rebounding battle by a wide margin, 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards. This led to 23 second-chance points and the Gauchos outscoring the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>This season, UCSB averages 40.0 rebounds in victories compared to 30.6 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We keep getting reminded that we had 55 rebounds (last time against UCR), which was our highest rebounding game this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s obviously what let us win the game, so if we focus on that, we should be good.”</p>\n<p>After losing 16 straight games, Riverside finally earned its first conference win Saturday 87-75 over UC Irvine. The Highlanders won the game on the offensive end, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and a phenomenal 61.1 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Leading Riverside, per usual, was sophomore guard Brittany Crain. She scored 22 against Irvine and was one of four players in double-figures for the Highlanders. On the season, Crain leads the Big West in scoring at 18.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you’re ever going to stop a great player like her, but we have to make her work,” Mitchell said. “With a player like that, you have to ID her at all times and make her work to score her points.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end for UCSB, the Gauchos will continue to look to their seniors. Nesbit led the team with 20 points in the last matchup while Zornig also added 16 points.</p>\n<p>Recently, Zornig has caught fire, recording her first career double-double in Northridge with 21 points and 11 rebounds, including 4-6 shooting from behind the arc. The leader in three-point percentage during conference play at 57.4 percent has hit at least two threes in eight straight games and currently stands 17 points shy of 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] continues to have an attack mentality and she’s shooting the ball with confidence,” Mitchell said. “She’s taking good shots, she’s being assertive on the offensive end and she’s also rebounding. She’ll get two or three rebound putbacks every game, so she’s scoring in a variety of ways.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at SRC Arena.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-faces-ucr-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":537,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[536,535,534],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kyle Boswell: A True Student Athlete","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Boswell Balances One of the Toughest Majors on Campus With His Critical Role For UCSB Basketball","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The technical terms ‘high-post screen’ and ‘thermodynamics’ are often discussed in different circles and rarely intermix in a conversation.

While at Edison, Boswell became the all-time leader in career points, averaging over 23 points per game as a senior behind a deadly perimeter shot. That outside shot garnered the attention of UCSB, a dream come true for Kyle, who was interested in more than just basketball.</p>\n<p>With a scholarship in hand, Boswell knew he wanted to become a Gaucho and major in mechanical engineering, but faced road blocks in achieving that goal from the time he stepped on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our engineering program is definitely at the top of the line. I didn’t get into the program because it was so competitive,” Boswell said. “I had to petition and take some courses and compete against some of the people for them to even consider me to get into the major. After about a year and a half, they told me my performance in the classroom was good enough to let me in. That in itself was a blessing.”</p>\n<p>His 3.8 GPA is evidence enough that he warranted a spot in an engineering program that often ranks in the top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Moving onto campus, Boswell had the task of balancing more than your average Gaucho had to, adjusting to college life and taking engineering courses in addition to his duties as a basketball player. During his freshman year, Boswell played a reserve role for a team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, starting six of the 21 contests he played in.</p>\n<p>During his sophomore season, Boswell truly became an outside weapon for Santa Barbara, leading the team in three-point field goal percentage while ranking in the top four in minutes played. This is when Boswell emerged as a sixth man for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I absolutely love being the sixth man. I like to kind of sit back for a couple minutes in the game, see the landscape and how the flow’s going, how our team’s playing and what I need to do coming off the bench,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Since then, Boswell has volunteered to come off the bench, a role in which he has certainly found success. Last season, Boswell averaged 13 points per game on his way to the Sixth Man of the Year award and all-conference honorable mention. This year, he ranks second on the Gauchos in scoring with 11 points per game and currently ranks third in school history in three-pointers made.</p>\n<p>Aside from his success on the court, Boswell has received tremendous recognition for his ability to balance academics as well. This past fall Boswell was named one of 30 semi-finalists for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, was named the Big West Scholar Athlete of the Year for men’s basketball and is also a two-time recipient of the Golden Eagle award for academic excellence.</p>\n<p>“In terms of being successful here as a student athlete, anyone can do it. I’m not like a freak of nature, who, like no other kid in the school, can do what I do,” Boswell said. “You’ve honestly got to love what you do and just put in the work. It’s the lifestyle; you’ve got to embrace the challenge and give it all you got.”</p>\n<p>While not unheard of, being a student-athlete in the engineering department is certainly rare, and something Boswell and his professors must talk over due to the demands of travel for competition.</p>\n<p>“Not many athletes come out of this department so it’s kind of new for [professors]. Kind of every quarter, I need to talk to teachers right away and let them know my situation,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>This upcoming summer, Boswell will intern with Chevron in Los Angeles in a major step towards achieving his eventual goal of working in an oil field.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it will be great for me because I love learning about the thermodynamics side of stuff and fluid mechanics, and you put that together and you get working in an oil field,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Boswell will exhaust his eligibility for basketball after this season, but will return to UCSB next year to complete his degree without the athlete title. Needless to say, academics should be a piece of cake for Boswell next year without the extra demand of collegiate athletics.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that I could have only dreamed about. You don’t get this many opportunities in life where you’re exposed to such a high caliber education and at the same time you’re playing at the highest collegiate level of basketball,” Boswell said. “UCSB is a paradise and I couldn’t ask for anything more out of the school.”</p>\n<p>Boswell and the rest of the UCSB men’s basketball team host UC Riverside tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/","id":538,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[537,536,535],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts UC Riverside at the Thunderdome With Six Games Left in the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in second place in the Big West with six games remaining in the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With six games left on its schedule, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the final stretch of the regular season in hopes of finishing atop the Big West Conference standings.

In that contest, UCSB took an 11-point lead and built it to an eventual 17-point advantage in the second half. The Gauchos struggled to close out the game, however, allowing Riverside to creep back and send the game to overtime before an eventual 68-65 victory avoided an epic collapse.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had several of these this year where we’ve had leads and we’ve let things slip away. We have to develop more of a killer instinct to finish games,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have to get hungrier in terms of our approach to each game and how we play for 40 minutes in the game. All of a sudden we’re up and you see us relax a little bit and that’s a dangerous habit to be falling into.”</p>\n<p>Closing out games has become a major area of concern for Santa Barbara and hurt the team in last Saturday’s 80-78 overtime loss to Cal State Northridge despite holding a seven-point lead with just over a minute remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s loss, UCSB failed to score in the final two minutes of overtime and turned the ball over 18 times during the entire contest. Turnovers will certainly be a key to Thursday’s contest as Riverside ranks last in the Big West with over 13 turnovers committed per game, compared to second-best UCSB with 11.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“In that Northridge game, there were certain plays we didn’t run and we didn’t do all the tasks that we needed to do to win that game and it came back to bite us,” junior center Alan Williams said. “We’ve really got to focus up on that and be more mentally tough and I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the contest with an 8-17 overall record and 3-8 mark in conference play, which places the team last in the Big West standings. The Highlanders are currently on a three-game losing streak at the hands of three of the top teams in the conference in Long Beach, Hawaii and Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we just come out and we try to assert ourselves more consistently throughout a 40-minute game instead of the lapses that we’ve been having,” Coach Williams said. “Hopefully our familiarity is good with them, but I think they’re a better team. They’re a better team now than they were earlier this year.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders will be a pair of forwards in senior Chris Patton and sophomore Taylor Johns. Patton leads the team with 13.3 points per game, while Johns trails right behind at 13.1 per game. Johns also ranks third in the conference with 8.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game ranked No. 13 in College Insider’s Mid-Major poll, powered by the play of Big Al. Williams ranks ninth in the nation in scoring at 22.7 points per game and is second in the country with 11.5 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Playing well as of late for the Gauchos is point guard Zalmico Harmon who ranks third in the nation with a 4.07 assist to turnover ratio. Against Northridge, the junior scored a career-high 21 points, dished out eight assists and committed only one turnover.</p>\n<p>“If we play our game, we’re able to beat anybody in this league,” Bryson said. “When we get let down is when we start kind of being nonchalant with our actions and nonchalant with our execution, so I think if we really play 40 minutes of basketball … we’ll come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Thursday’s contest at the Thunderdome is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/","id":539,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[538,537,536],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
