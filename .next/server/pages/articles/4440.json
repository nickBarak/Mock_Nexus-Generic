Senator Alex Giolito last week prompted county officials to come sooner.</p>\n<p>The petition calls for the termination of the project and urges alternative methods of controlling the intersection’s traffic flow to be considered.</p>\n<p>“I know they spent a lot of work on it and appreciate them addressing the current solution, but I believe alternatives can still be reached,” Giolito said.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Giolito said the signal would stop hundreds of bikes during rush hour and thus “clog” the intersection.</p>\n<p>McKarrell said Isla Vista Foot Patrol recognized the intense volume of traffic at the Pardall intersection almost a decade ago in 1998. However, it was not until 2007 that possible solutions were discussed. In 2013, county officials proposed the idea of a traffic signal.</p>\n<p>“I think it will actually help the bikes and pedestrians to all get through, and people will always know who has the right of way,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>Bert Johnson emphasized the simplicity of the traffic light’s design, noting that the signal would include an additional mast arm clearly visible to bikers so they will be able to see the signal before arriving at the intersection.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Giolito asked if county officials had considered the possibility of cars speeding on the six-and-a-half-block stretch of Embarcadero Del Norte, from Embarcadero Hall to Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the Santa Barbara Public Works Department has found that car speeds average around 29 miles per hour. He added that after the signal is installed, they will test the speeds again to ensure they do not exceed the 30-mile-per-hour range.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Aaron Hendizadeh asked the officials about how the new traffic light would be enforced.</p>\n<p>According to McKarrell, the I.V. Foot Patrol will initially implement a warning period for people who do not abide by the new traffic light. He said after a certain period of time, if people do not adhere to the signal, then enforcement will begin.</p>\n<p>McKarrell added, however, that the most important aspect of enforcing the signal is the safety of pedestrians and bikers at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“The only tools we have are educating the community on how to be safe and the other is enforcement,” McKarrell said. “The officers don’t want to come out here and start handing out citations. We have matters that are much more serious, but it is your safety that’s paramount.”</p>\n<p>The officials addressed alternative solutions to the signal, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or funneling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V.; however, all of these solutions were “too multilayered” to be deemed feasible.</p>\n<p>The officials suggested future discussions about the traffic signal closer to the beginning of the signal’s construction.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named A.S.

The win marked the first road victory against the Bruins since 2011 and the program’s first win against a defending champ since 1999.</p>\n<p>In that game, Santa Barbara had a solid outing from sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza who went into the sixth inning allowing only two runs to the potent Bruin offense. UCSB also benefitted from timely hitting by junior infielders Tyler Kuresa and Pete Maris who each went deep: Together they accounted for five of UCSB’s six runs in the game.</p>\n<p>So far in the season, the Gauchos have relied on its bullpen to get them out of trouble in late game situations. Sophomore Dillon Tate has converted on both of his save opportunities and junior Greg Mahle is developing into a reliable setup man for Tate. Before Tuesday’s game, the bullpen came in with a 2.40 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been on an offensive tear as of late, as it has put up a combined 16 runs in its past two games. Senior third baseman Joey Epperson has excelled at the top of the lineup and leads the team with a .450 batting average, while Kuresa has been the Gaucho’s power hitter with two homeruns in five games.</p>\n<p>In its first game of the season, Princeton enters looking to improve on last year’s 14-28 finish where the team was mostly hurt by its fielding errors; the Tigers had the most in their conference with 74.</p>\n<p>Although being among the middle of the conference in batting average and ERA last season, the Tigers return players capable of becoming big threats this season. Senior infielder/outfielder Alec Keller batted .378 with four homeruns and will be counted on to lead the offensive production for the young Princeton squad this year.</p>\n<p>Another potential threat in the lineup of the Tigers is sophomore infielder Danny Hoy who managed a .307 batting average to go along with 21 RBIs and two homers.</p>\n<p>On the mound, sophomore Cameron Mingo will have to step up for the Tigers after the loss of their two best pitchers from last year.

UCSB clinched the game with five runs in the seventh inning to win 11-0 after the game was called off one inning early.</p>\n<p>“We put some quality hits together and put on a hit parade,” junior infielder Woody Woodward said. “The coaches did their homework on the guys they were going to throw and we just went up there with a plan and stuck to it.”</p>\n<p>The first game of the doubleheader was a slugfest with weather conditions matching the play on the field. UCSB fell behind after a Princeton five-run inning in the top of the second inning, but scored four runs of its own in the bottom half to lead 6-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht was chased from the game after allowing runners to reach second and third base in the third inning; Hecht was charged with seven runs, five earned in 2.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>The usually dependable UCSB bullpen did not fare better and tacked on four runs in the inning. However, the Gauchos broke the game open in the seventh inning, exploding for five runs to break a 10-10 tie. UCSB added on to the lead in the following inning to take the game 18-10.</p>\n<p>“We were sloppy in the field and I think we finally were able to get going,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That was like a bad football game; our guys plugged away and we found a way to win ugly.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Justin Jacome pitched one of his best games in the series opener on Friday. The lefty threw seven innings of shutout ball and struck out a career-high seven batters to pick up his first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Setting the tone early by striking out five of the first six hitters faced, Jacome took a no-hitter into the fifth inning before being broken up. Jacome faced the minimum in what was his second time in his career shutting out the opposing side as starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>“Our pitching staff is fantastic and we have all really good guys. There’s no drop off between the first, second and third guy,” Woodward said. “It’s a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game open in the sixth inning after already leading by two runs. The Gauchos jumped on the new relief pitcher after two batters reached second and third base. A sacrifice fly, a wild pitch and a single turned into a three-run inning for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took advantage of a shaky Tiger bullpen and scored four runs in the eighth inning, capped off by a two-run homerun by senior third baseman Joey Epperson. UCSB took the game 9-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for Tuesday’s contest against Waseda University of Japan. First pitch is set for 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54309\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54309\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/hot-bats-power-ucsb-sweep-of-princeton/","id":4438,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4437,4436,4435],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Freebies and To-Dos this Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Surf competitions, open mic nights and more this week in I.V.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>OPEN MIC<br>\nKCSB will be hosting an open mic at Giovanni’s in Isla Vista on Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. The event coordinators recommend that performers email promotion@kcsb.org with the details of their performance.
