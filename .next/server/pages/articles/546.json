UCSB is 18-7 overall and has won two straight games, while Irvine is 18-10, previously losing its one-game lead on the Gauchos with a loss to Cal State Northridge last Saturday. Needless to say, tonight’s game in Irvine holds major implications for both teams’ chances to finish on top of the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re pretty confident in themselves when we play high level teams and competition,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve played well in big games this year; we played well in the preseason at UNLV and Cal, UCLA and Colorado. We feel like we’re pretty well suited to play in these types of games and we’re just excited about the opportunity.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the two teams previously met on Jan. 30, UCSB ran the Anteaters out of the Thunderdome with an 80-60 victory. In that victory, however, Irvine was without junior forward Will Davis II, last year’s Big West Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“He’s a key player for them, no doubt. He’s not one of the top three scorers, but what he is, is a really versatile four/five,” Coach Williams said. “Even though you don’t see him at the five much, I think you will see him at times at the five today. I think you’ll see them go to a small team, press us, play small with the five, and it gives them way more versatility than with their big guys they have.”</p>\n<p>Another player to watch for Irvine is freshman Mamadou Ndiaye. The 7’6” freshman is the tallest player in collegiate basketball and ranks 8th in the nation with 3.19 blocks to per game. Irvine features much depth along its starting line with freshman guard Luke Nelson and senior guard Chris McNealy each averaging over 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>Because of its depth, Irvine has played well of late, as the Anteaters were winners of five straight games before falling to Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the test against Irvine,” Coach Williams said. “We’re sure that they will play much better than when they played here against us, and I think we’re ready for the challenge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with plenty of momentum as well, winning six of its last seven games; the lone loss coming in overtime to the same Northridge team. Leading the Gauchos is junior center Alan Williams. Big Al leads the nation with 12.0 rebounds per game and ranks 8th in the country with 22.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Part of [his rebounding ability is] he creates space, but the other part of it is he’s leaner, he’s moving really well, he’s got great instincts, he follows where the ball is going and he reads it really well,” Coach Williams said. “He’s just got great gifts, tremendous feet, tremendous hands, he’s a very good player.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have come to expect greatness from Big Al, another player in junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has emerged as a game-changer for a UCSB team hitting its stride. Harmon ranks second in the nation with a 4.52 assist to turnover ratio and is second in the conference with over 5.2 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Even more impressive, Harmon has compiled 50 assists and only three turnovers in his last nine games. In addition to his superb ball handling, Harmon has also become an efficient scorer for the Gauchos, notching two 20-point games in the last three contests. In the team’s last game, Harmon racked up 20 points and 10 assists, the first Gaucho to accomplish the feat since 1989.</p>\n<p>“He continues to get better. He makes great decisions and takes great care of the ball, obviously,” Coach Williams said. “He’s shooting the ball with much more confidence now, he’s playing his best basketball of the year and we just kind of expect him to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>No doubt that on Saturday the Gauchos will rely on what has been working for them all year — feeding Big Al down low and relying on its perimeter shooters to hit outside shots and drive to the rim for open looks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to play tremendous defense against an Irvine squad that ranks first in the conference in field goal percentage at 47.5 percent. Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to under 36 percent in the victory earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounding and will challenge Big Al, the nation’s top rebounder, down low. In the team’s previous matchup, Big Al managed to dominate as he has done all season with 26 points and 10 rebounds, with the Gauchos winning the battle on the glass by eight.</p>\n<p>“There’s high energy, a lot of emotion in this game because it is such a big game and the environment is going to be hostile and they always bring a good crowd,” Big Al said. “It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun to play there and go up against Irvine. We’re really excited. It’s a big game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s clash between the first-place teams is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center in Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54257\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54257\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/","id":546,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[545,544,543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Rebounds Against CSUF on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Womens-Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 64-54","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lack of consistency has been the UCSB women’s basketball team’s weakness all season long.</p>\n<p>Falling victim to coming out slow in both halves has resulted in a poor conference season for the Gauchos.

We had a lot of collapses late in the game, but [the key was us mixing] it up tonight,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think a lot of teams are nervous to play Fullerton because they can shoot it so well. By extending our zone, it was causing some issues [for them].”</p>\n<p>Plus, on a guard-driven team, UCSB finally found its post presence inside. At 6’4’’, Watkins headed the Gauchos’ zone defense and her height helped hold Fullerton from downtown. Then on offense, she earned the first double-double of her career with 10 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“That’s the personality and identity we’ve been looking for,” Mitchell said. “We had an inside presence (tonight) and it makes a world of difference when you can get double figures from an inside post player. That, by far, was the biggest difference in what we did tonight over any of our previous [25] games.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara improves to 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, keeping its playoff hopes alive with four games remaining on the season. Fullerton drops to 6-6 in conference and 10-15 overall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the game with energy, going on a 9-0 run, which UCSB held onto to take a 28-22 lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, UCSB continued to increase its lead, extending the margin to 19 points with just under four minutes remaining. While Fullerton made a push in the final minutes, the large lead would be enough to keep the Titans at bay.</p>\n<p>“We were excited at halftime and happy about the way we were playing. We looked at each other and said, ‘They came back last time. We don’t want it to happen again,’” Watkins said. “There was a will to win because we just didn’t want a repeat of last time. The last couple minutes, I think everyone had a slight heart attack on the bench, but we were able to pull it out.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB shot 49.1 percent from the field compared to 33.9 percent for Fullerton. The Gauchos also outscored the Titans 32-22 in the paint.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos gave up a game-high 29 points to Titan senior guard Alex Thomas, Santa Barbara featured three players in double figures. While senior guard Nicole Nesbit led the team with 19 points and six rebounds on 8-16 shooting, it was a career night for senior guard Melissa Zornig, who reached the 1,000-point mark with her first basket of the game. Zornig finished the night with 18 points and four assists.</p>\n<p>“[She brings] so much consistency and leadership. She’s a very selfless player and it’s encouraging to coach someone who will do anything for the team to win,” Mitchell said. “She wasn’t worried about the thousandth point, but it’s nice for her to be able to have that for her scrapbook someday and to be able to sit down with the grandkids and let people know that back in the day that she was a scorer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next weekend for its final road series of the regular reason, facing UC Irvine Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-rebounds-against-csuf-on-the-road/","id":543,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[542,541,540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Anteaters After Snapping Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in eighth place in the Big West and will try to win its second straight game Thursday night against Irvine.

We may look to double, and that’s just out of respect for what she can do when she gets the ball.”</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters rank second in the conference in scoring during league play at 73.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met up in Irvine, Buckley was the biggest reason her team came away with the 77-60 victory. Buckley was dominant, scoring 27 points on 7-12 shooting, including 13-15 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>She also grabbed 15 rebounds, aiding the Anteaters in winning the rebounding battle 43-28. Santa Barbara currently ranks last in the Big West in rebounding at just 33.9 boards on the season. The statistic carries significant weight in the win-loss column too, with the Gauchos getting 39.9 rebounds in wins compared to 31.1 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure [Buckley] doesn’t touch it,” junior center Clair Watkins said. “That’d be the easiest way to make sure she doesn’t score. It’s going to be up to the post players to stay lower than her and be physical with her.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB will throw multiple defensive looks at Buckley, Watkins will earn plenty of time on the dominant senior. She comes off a solid weekend herself in which she earned her first double-double last Saturday in Santa Barbara’s win over Cal State Fullerton. She scored 10 points and tallied 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton was more finesse and Clair had to guard guards and three-point shooters,” Mitchell said. “Now it’ll be a physical game, so I’ll be interested to see how she does because I think she’s understanding now that that’s what we have to have from her. That was the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend, the Gauchos split their games, losing to last-place UC Riverside in the team’s most devastating loss of the year before rebounding for a victory over Fullerton. While inconsistency continued to plague the Gauchos in Riverside, UCSB came out strong and sustained its energy for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“We all were upset about the Riverside game, but we went into Fullerton with a chip on our shoulder and came out with a lot of energy,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s what won us the game, so if we come with that same energy and mindset for Irvine, I think we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>With three of the team’s final games at home, Santa Barbara has the opportunity to try to improve its seed for the conference tournament. At 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, UCSB currently stands in the eighth and final playoff spot, 1.5 games up on UC Riverside. Fullerton sits in a three-way tie for fifth place at 13-13 overall and 6-6 in conference.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s still a little hurt from that Riverside game,” Watkins said. “That’s one we should’ve came away with fairly easily, but we have four games left. We have to get all of them. Each one counts more now than ever because we want to get into the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/","id":544,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[543,542,541],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Moves Into Tie for First in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=921%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 80-65","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a close win over UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB men’s basketball team needed a win over Cal State Fullerton Saturday to move into first place in the Big West.

The Titans went on a run to cut the deficit to 32-21, but with less than 30 seconds left in the half, Harmon found sophomore forward Taran Brown for a two-hand facial dunk, sending UCSB to the half with the momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s always exciting to get a dunk because you get the crowd into it and you get your teammates all going crazy on the bench,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It’s an opportunity to increase your level of energy and it’s on [your teammates] to match that.”</p>\n<p>As he has all year, Williams dominated both offensively and defensively. From the opening minutes, the big man played with an extra bounce in his step, making it look easy on his way to a 22-point, 18-rebound double-double on 8-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Titans fought back for the entire second half, led by guard Michael Williams. The senior single-handedly kept his team in the game, scoring a game-high 29 points and knocking down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos always found an answer, however. Big Al gobbled up every rebound he could reach in the second half, and a one-hand highlight dunk off a loose ball pushed UCSB’s lead back up to 46-29 with just under 13 minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>With just four minutes to go, a three-pointer by Michael Williams cut the Gauchos’ lead to 63-54. The next time down the court, Bryson answered with another UCSB dunk, pushing the lead back up to 11 and dismantling any hope of a Titan comeback. Santa Barbara closed out the final minutes by knocking down free throws on their way to an 80-65 win.</p>\n<p>“It got a little closer [in the second half] but it was nice not to have to fight until the bitter end,” Bryson said. “We’re on a good track right now.”</p>\n<p>Harmon ended the night with 20 points and 10 assists while committing zero turnovers. In his last nine games, he has accumulated 49 assists and just three turnovers.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way we’ve had a player go through a stretch like this since I’ve been here,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s been amazing and has just gotten better and more confident as the season’s gone on. He’s absolutely a stud and he’s getting better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the road for a first-place showdown against UC Irvine this Thursday.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/","id":545,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[544,543,542],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
