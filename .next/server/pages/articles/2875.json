Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into underground rock in order to force it open and extract oil or gas. Mason specializes in Environmental and Resource Economics and is an associate editor of the <em>European Economic Review</em>, co-editor of the <em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</em> and joint editor-in-chief of <em>Strategic Behavior in the Environment.</em></p>\n<p>Mason began his lecture by addressing the economic advantages behind fracking such as increased employment from fracking-related jobs as well as an increase in the supply of natural gas for consumers worldwide.</p>\n<p>“With this kind of expansion in production you have a large increase in supply,” Mason said. “That generally means two things to people who use natural gas — greater ability and lower prices. This is the kind of thing that politicians would naturally glom onto.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, another advantage brought on by fracking includes a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>“This big increase in the production of natural gas has lead to a displacement of coal as a source for producing electricity, which in turn means a reduction of carbon emissions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>However, Mason said the potential water contamination caused by hydraulic reinjection is a major concern regarding fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“A particular amount of the angst about fracking, I think, has to do with the potential for groundwater contamination,” Mason said. “The contaminated water that comes from the frack job is the larger consideration.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61006\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61006\" data-attachment-id=\"61006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/prof-discusses-pros-cons-of-fracking/mason-fracking-talk_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=2567%2C3470&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2567,3470\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424178408\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"36\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mason Fracking Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61006\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2-758x1024.jpg?resize=350%2C473\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 758w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Mason, research on the exact environmental costs of fracking has been hindered by the incomplete record keeping on the part of natural gas companies.</p>\n<p>“Until relatively recently, there was considerable lack of transparency about what was being done,” Mason said. “We don’t know what’s in the chemical compounds that are being used as part of the frack job, we don’t know how dangerous it is … we don’t know whether or not we should worry about this getting into our groundwater.”</p>\n<p>Mason also said his research on water contamination, which is his focus regarding his studies on fracking in Sublette County, Wyoming, has shown him the extent of companies’ inadequacy in reporting fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“There’s asymmetric information,” Mason said. “The firms that are undertaking these jobs know exactly what they’re injecting, but we know nothing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, he uses company reports to research the consequences of fracking, and his findings have shown that some potentially toxic ingredients of the fracking process are left out as “trade secrets.”</p>\n<p>“They do have specific information of the ingredients that were used, subject to trade secrets exceptions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>First-year student in the Bren School master’s program Leah Fine said Mason’s lecture reinforced material she has learned in her environmental policy classes.</p>\n<p>“Especially since being at Bren, I’ve become more interested in the production of groundwater resources,” Fine said. “It was a cool tie-in with some of the curriculum here at the Bren School, and I thought it was really interesting to hear how different companies disclose information.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year student in the Bren School master’s program Hye Min Park, it was useful to hear about the practical applications of fracking outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>“This is a really specific issue that I don’t always get to learn about in lectures,” Park said, “I thought it was really interesting to see how it is applied in the real world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They soon learned that the man was a bit confused when he announced that he was going to walk down “Via Cadero” to get to his home – in San Bernardino.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the man how he was possibly going to make it home from his current location, the man explained that he would walk straight and turn left.</p>\n<p>Since the subject’s projected path would lead him directly into the Pacific Ocean, the officer decided that the man was too intoxicated to care for his own safety and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Exorcism of Inebriated Rose<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 14, 11:58 p.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road contacted a 19-year-old woman when they saw her lying on the sidewalk with her head in a man’s lap.</p>\n<p>An officer approached the woman, but she was completely unresponsive and would not reply to any of his questions. For the woman’s safety, the officer called the paramedics.</p>\n<p>A few minutes after UCSB paramedics arrived on the scene, they requested assistance from the IVFP because the woman was trying to escape from the medics, kicking and yelling to get away.</p>\n<p>The medics confirmed that the woman was not in medical distress, only extremely intoxicated. The medics placed the woman in the officer’s custody.</p>\n<p>Throughout the incident, the subject yelled expletives, and at one point her blouse fell down exposing her chest; throughout she was unsteady on her feet.</p>\n<p>After her little peep show, officers decided the woman was too intoxicated to care for her safety or the safety of others, and placed her under arrest.</p>\n<p>After being taken into custody, she went on a drunken tirade, calling everyone present “fuckers,” and assuring officers that her “lawyer” had guaranteed that she was not to be touched.</p>\n<p>She also said her lawyer, with whom she must have communicated telepathically, demanded that she be freed, all the while managing to maintain a steady stream of obscenities.</p>\n<p>The woman continued to rant as she was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was booked – despite her lawyer’s promise – pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Insane in the Membrane<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 14 12:44 a.m. – Officers responding to an incident in progress on the corner of Sabado Tarde Road and El Embarcadero arrested an 18-year-old man who was fighting on the street.</p>\n<p>The subject was hit in the head during the scuffle, and deputies had the UCSB medics examine him before questioning him.</p>\n<p>When the man’s health was cleared, an officer attempted to speak with him. The subject was only able to answer one of the officer’s questions, an inquiry into the amount of alcohol he drank, to which he replied, “A lot.” Then the man repeatedly announced, “I’m drunk as fuck.”</p>\n<p>The subject also failed to remember where he lived, admitting, “I can’t remember ‘cuz I’m drunk as fuck.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for being “drunk as fuck” and he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

evening to inspect light posts and light bulbs on campus in an effort to make the university safer and more light-efficient.</p>\n<p>UCPD officers, university staff, administrators, professors, students and Campus Security Officers (CSO) participated in the event with the goal of making the university a more secure environment at night. The event split participants into three groups and covered three different walking routes: behind Davidson Library; from Girvetz Hall to the Student Resource Building (SRB); near the bus loop and the RecCen. Each group was led by a UCPD officer, two university staff members and two CSOs.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher said safety involves “adequate lighting” on campus, and Administrative Services strives to address lighting issues every year.</p>\n<p>“It is very important for people to feel safe within the community,” Fisher said. “We have been working on new lighting projects for the past twelve years, since I have personally been here.”</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, old round light bulbs, also called “Johnny Balls,” will be replaced in every walkway with newer and stronger white lighting.</p>\n<p>“We have replaced fixtures such as Johnny Balls,” Fisher said. “Our goal is to have most of those replaced throughout the walkways. We want a whiter light everywhere and we see lighting deficiency right now, but it will be improved.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university is installing new lighting because the currently-placed bulbs are an outdated brand that contribute to light pollution.</p>\n<p>“The old Johnny Balls were created in the 1960s, but we are replacing the old style fixtures,” Fisher said. “These globe lights produce sky globes, and one of the goals of the campus is to change this because in an environmental perspective, it spills light into the sky for color rendition and we want light on the ground as opposed to the sky.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD Patrol Sergeant Matt Blime said bright lighting prevents crime from occurring on campus and allows students to feel more safe on campus at night.</p>\n<p>“I think proper lighting on campus is a deterrence for crime,” Blime said. “If a person is looking to commit a crime, it is less likely that they will do it in an area that is very well lit. At the same time, it gives students more of a sense of safety and security while walking on the campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Blime, serious crimes on campus have been less frequent over the past year due to student participation in safety-related events.</p>\n<p>“We want to promote safety, for everyone here,” Blime said. “We have had a reduction of serious crime in the past year. We have had a 10-20 percent decrease in crimes and it has become more popular for students to participate in these walks and create more safety because we address concerns.”</p>\n<p>Campus Senior Electrical Utility Lead Jim Morrison said a person’s facial expression is more visible under whiter light, which would expose the intentions of a potential perpetrator before a crime is committed.</p>\n<p>“We want more white light,” Morrison said. “During the summer months, they stay on for nine hours and 13 hours in the winter time. If you have a whiter light, you can see facial expressions more. Before a crime, you can see if people look ticked-off and this light makes it possible to see.”</p>\n<p>Biology graduate student graduate Emily Ellis said it is discomforting to walk to her car at night in the dark after late classes.</p>\n<p>“The animals that I study are nocturnal,” Ellis said. “I am happy to stay for experiments, but it is unnerving when it is pitch black and I am the only person on campus. I definitely walk faster and only go towards areas where it is well-lit.”</p>\n<p>Ellis said she worries about her students’ safety when they leave her class at 10 p.m. because the Life Sciences Building currently does not have sufficient lighting due to construction at Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>“It is good to see what is around you and to feel safe as if you are in your own home,” Ellis said. “I worry for them because you never know what can happen.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, administrators and police officers have demonstrated throughout the years that they are invested in ensuring student safety.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is really assuring that people care about the student concerns. It seems like the administrators and UCPD officers really care about the opinions of students. The survey that was sent out via email recently is an example of this as well.”</p>\n<p>CSO officer and fourth-year Chican@ studies major Melissa Cruz said theft is the most common crime on campus. According to her, theft occurs frequently because darkness facilitates stealing.</p>\n<p>“I have been a CSO for three years and the lights have always been important,” Cruz said, “It brightens up the campus and deters people from stealing things. Stealing is the biggest issue here at UCSB, especially stealing bikes.”</p>\n<p>Cruz said CSO flashlights can only do so much to prevent theft at night and that the new installation of lights will help significantly more in preventing crime.</p>\n<p>“If somebody looks suspicious, we only flash our lights at them,” Cruz said. “But if there are lights then it can prevent them from stealing bikes.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/campus-looks-to-improve-university-lighting/","id":2873,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2872,2871,2870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Concert Almost Canceled Over Insurance","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?resize=901%2C561&ssl=1","description":"Hip hop group The Coup nearly had to cancel their upcoming show this Friday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) Theater after the university originally did not grant the band an insurance waiver last we...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61015\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61015\" data-attachment-id=\"61015\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/concert-almost-canceled-over-insurance-concerns/the-coup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?fit=901%2C561&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"901,561\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Robert\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"the coup\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-coup.jpg?resize=600%2C374\" alt=\"Hip Hop group The Coup nearly had their upcoming show in the MCC canceled due to insurance difficulties with the university until campus professors and administrators stepped in to intervene.

According to Riley’s Facebook and Twitter posts, this caused university staff and faculty, including Black Studies professor Gaye Theresa Johnson, to reverse the decision and allow The Coup to perform.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said The Coup had difficulty with the university’s insurance policy because campuswide insurance carrier Campus Connexxus does not provide coverage for hip hop artists. According to Armistead, hip-hop artists in the past have been able to perform because they had their own insurance, but The Coup did not.</p>\n<p>“The insurance carrier does not provide coverage for hip-hop,” Armistead said in an email. “When this is the case, the artists that want to come to campus must supply their insurance coverage. The Coup does not have its own insurance.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said the MCC’s request that the insurance requirement be waived so The Coup could play was originally denied, but that she then worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to get the requirement waived.</p>\n<p>“When I learned that a waiver was denied I worked with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services to correct the decision,” Armistead said in an email. “Once it was deemed that there was no security issue with the group coming to campus, the decision to not waive the insurance requirement was reversed. So, the show will go on.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said while she was able to help get the insurance waived within 24 hours, the outbreak on social media created a “storm.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59865\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59865\" data-attachment-id=\"59865\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/concert-almost-canceled-over-insurance-concerns/mcc_file-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"11\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398169298\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59865\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"MCC/Entrance_File Photo\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of the outside of the MultiCultural Center building on campus. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>“The issue was corrected within 24 hours of the original decision,” Armistead said. “Unfortunately, the social media storm started while we were already working on the issue.”</p>\n<p>KCSB Development Coordinator Ted Coe said it was odd that the university would not provide insurance to The Coup for playing hip hop music.</p>\n<p>“It’s like there is a certain artistic expression, but then you’re told that expression isn’t welcome on campus,” Coe said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics and mathematics major George Purtell said he was disappointed to hear The Coup might not be able to play on campus this Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Coup is always playing on my iPod,” Purtell said. “I was looking forward to seeing them, but when I saw Boots Riley’s post on Facebook, I was definitely disappointed with the university.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Purtell said he was glad the insurance requirement was eventually waived and that the university is now allowing The Coup to play their upcoming show.</span></p>\n<p>“I was definitely relieved to hear that it all worked out in the end,” Purtell said. “I will be the first one there to see them on Friday night.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Listen to The Coup on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ5hD-fpksO0-7xLoBq3lTw\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> or <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/artist/4IvS1ZZ5nyiNMheybfx3Hf\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
