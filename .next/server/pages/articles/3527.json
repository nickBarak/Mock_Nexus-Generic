Every year, tech giants such as Intel and Microsoft, along with companies such as Panasonic and LG spend tens of thousands on setting up elaborate booths, some spanning multiple floors, to display their latest products and innovations. Also alongside these huge companies are hordes of smaller booths, some rented by individual entrepreneurs to promote their inventions, some manned by young companies trying to break into a niche market, but the largest amount are staffed by vendors promoting the dull but essential elements of the electronics industry, such as cables and batteries.  However, most vendors boasted an array of gadgets that fell somewhere between the commonplace and the outrageous.</p>\n<p>Household names such as Skype, Taser, iRobot (manufacturers of the Roomba), Polaroid and many others made up a bulk of the show, showcasing one or two new products or services rather than partaking in the showmanship war that the larger companies seem trapped in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If this year’s CES had a theme, it was certainly 3D.  Every company that could show off a 3D TV was, from the over-the-top wall mounted TV displays of Panasonic and LG to the more low-key offerings of Sharp and others, it was almost easy to forget these companies had ever made anything else.</p>\n<p>In the case of LG, there was a comical dichotomy between the energy and grandeur that went into showing off their latest TVs and the rest of their products.  Attendees lined up to don 3D glasses and view elaborate displays while workers scrambled to answer questions and show off the new devices.  Opposite the TVs was the other part of the LG booth, showcasing their newest refrigerator. With one lonely employee in front of an austere display, there was almost a feeling that LG itself had chosen to forget about their other product lines in favor of showcasing 3D technology.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 3D TVs themselves, other companies rode the 3D wave with products such as designer 3D glasses to be worn over regular glasses and other 3D TV accessories including stereos and more.  Companies such as Canon and Sony also focused on their 3D camera offerings, trying to prove that 3D was not just for Hollywood or big TV studios, but also for your home movies and vacation photos.</p>\n<p>One of the most impressive 3D offerings that the show had was the technology to watch 3D without having to use glasses.  A few companies demonstrated familiar movies such as “Avatar” on these experimental displays.  While the technology is still somewhat rough — for example, the screens can only be properly viewed from a certain distance and height — the quality that these prototypes showed was impressive.  If you were to sit in the proper place, they achieved an effect somewhere between regular 2D television and full quality 3D. While the technology still has room to grow, it’s definitely something worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n<p>The show also featured the newest in experimental design and integrated technology from auto manufactures such as Audi, Tesla, GM and Ford.</p>\n<p>Audi showed off very slick displays they had integrated into the dash of their newest vehicles, capable of projecting information onto the windshield for a driver to view information without looking away from the road.  GM also brought their newest prototypes to Las Vegas: cars that can drive themselves and network with each other to form automated caravans that all follow a leader car.</p>\n<p>On top of everything else, CES had robots crawling all over the place, varying from a little device that cleaned windows by crawling up and down both sides of glass panes, to aquatic military drones.  iRobot showed off their newest devices, including a pool-cleaning robot and a nursing home robot that would provide automated care for residents.  This year saw a much larger focus on robotics than in previous years, with booths devoted both to individual components and finished demonstrations, such as a small robot that balanced on and rode a bike around stage.  Typically many of the smaller robotics offerings are not in the main hall, and it was interesting to see them closer to center stage this year.</p>\n<p>CES was, as usual, chaotic, crowded and impressive.  Attendees took over Las Vegas for the weekend, making it impossible to go anywhere without seeing a sea of CES badges and suits.  Staggeringly large, the show is a great example of the industry as a whole, and this year the show was bigger, more crowded and flashier than the last few years.  Also worth noting was the large percentage of Chinese vendors at the show, not just showing off components in small booths, but exhibiting finished products such as TVs and laptops that were sleek, cheap and ready to compete in the global market. In keeping with annual tradition, the show offered a smorgasbord of the latest, greatest products, impressive innovations and the promise to tempt electronics consumers in 2011.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><strong>Best In Show</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>Ford Focus EV</strong><br>\nFord premiered their first fully electric vehicle in their keynote on Saturday morning.  With a range of around 100 miles on a charge, and the ability to charge in standard 120v or 240v outlets, Ford has managed to take the practicality of the Focus to an even higher level.   Overall it’s an impressive vehicle, and Ford is looking at a release in the US sometime this year, with European releases in 2013.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Polaroid</strong><br>\nPolaroid premiered two interesting products, a camera being designed by Lady Gaga as part of a product line known as Gray Line, and a slightly less flashy portable photo printer with Bluetooth connectivity.  The camera has a real retro appearance, but with a beautiful screen and Polaroid’s iconic instant photos — now using an inkless technology called zink that prevents smudging and keeps the film small — it’s sure to find a market among enthusiasts.  The printer is marketed as a way to print photos from cellphones instantly without any computer, and unlike the camera, will be hitting shelves sometime this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Taser Demonstration</strong><br>\nTaser’s products were basically what you would expect: self-defense devices that fire electrified probes to disable potential attackers.  Despite some variation in color and shape, Taser’s products stayed true to their roots.  However, the Taser booth will remain one of the most memorable of the show because they allowed attendees to volunteer to be tased as live demonstrations.  There are few more ringing endorsements for your product as a self-defense tool then watching a man groan to his feet and answer “How do you feel?” with “like s^*t” over the booth’s sound system.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

With many new board members, with a new government and what will be seven years of service behind me, I think the university will benefit from some fresh blood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a phone call afterward with media outlets, Napolitano addressed her accomplishments, pointing out that she’s held tuition flat every year except for one and saying the president’s office has made “substantial progress” in implementing the audit’s recommended changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of the board and members of the public can [now] track the dollars in and the dollars out of the Office of the President in a better way,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Napolitano officially steps down next August, she said she wants to focus on the same efforts she has dedicated the past year to: increasing the number of degrees awarded, closing graduate gaps, strengthening sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, increasing availability of student housing and moving forward with UC’s goal to be carbon neutral and 100% reliable on renewable energy by 2025. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was announced on Tuesday that the UC is pulling its money out of fossil fuels, </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/university-of-california-system-divestment-fossil-fuels-886203/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divesting its $13.4 billion endowment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and $70 billion pension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano denied in a phone call the claim that she was resigning due to health issues, explaining that she had gone through chemotherapy in 2016 and 2017 and is now cancer free. She reiterated that the average time for college presidents to serve is six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After leaving her position, she will take a one-year sabbatical before resuming teaching at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy in the fall of 2021. It is not known at this time exactly what classes or subject she will teach, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked if she would ever run for public office again, accept a cabinet-level position or accept a Supreme Court nomination, Napolitano said she has “no intention in those regards” but she would “never say never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Napolitano’s successor, Chair Pérez said he will soon release the names of those selected to handle the nationwide search for a new UC president. The search committee will include students, faculty and alumni representatives, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pérez said the committee will be looking for a president who will help the university “maintain its role as the top public research university in the world and one that serves as the public mission the people of California have come to expect, and one that builds on the board’s commitment to expanding access and affordability.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

media outlets for accounts of wars the U.S. wages abroad, 61 students currently enrolled at UCSB have experienced military service firsthand. And for students like Antonio — who entered the Air Force shortly before 9/11, was dispatched to Afghanistan last summer and now awaits redeployment — war can mean something entirely too real, full of hardships and experiences that their civilian peers cannot fathom.</p>\n<p>A saddening phenomenon, Antonio said, is that even on the eve of Veteran’s Day, many students and community members question the merit of the holiday and project their disdain for the politics of the war onto the men and women who comprise the nation’s front lines.</p>\n<p><strong>The Choice to Serve</strong></p>\n<p>Dano Pagenkopf, who served in the navy from 1991-97 as a nuclear propulsion plant operator, said society often misinterprets soldiers’ reasons for signing onto the armed forces.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to not like a cause, like be against the war in Iraq or Afghanistan,” he said. “But to take it out on individual soldiers — it’s not cool. People say, ‘oh they had a choice.’ It’s not like that. People join for various reasons … a lot of students get help from their parents [to fund their college education]. Some people can’t afford that luxury.”</p>\n<p>Army sergeant Tim Webster, a first-year psychology major who served from 2002-07, said enlisting was simply ‘the right thing to do.’</p>\n<p>“I think everybody should serve, however short the term may be,” Webster said. “The money for college was appealing. I wouldn’t be able to afford UCSB without it.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, navy veteran Matthew Lewis, who served from 2003-09, said he thought joining the military would allow him to travel the world.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want to go to college yet,” Lewis, a second-year chemistry major, said. “It presented a good opportunity to see the world and learn something interesting, do something new with my life that my friends weren’t doing.” \tFormer E-5 naval sergeant Quincy Yamada, a fourth-year economics major whose unit was attached to an airwing onboard the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier, echoed Lewis’ sentiment.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"617892915\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/am2-aw-quincy-yamada-dn/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"611,498\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN-250x203.jpg?resize=250%2C203\" alt=\"\" title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" width=\"250\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29470\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“[What motivated me was] travel and an urge to get out of the bubble I was in,” Yamada wrote in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Yamada, whose unit was responsible for search and rescue, combat search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare efforts, his squadron was the first navy-helicopter squadron deployed in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Antonio, currently a third-year sociology and global studies major, said watching his friends graduate college and sink into traditional nine-to-five careers was impetus to seek something else.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do something that was bigger than myself,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Financial Aid Director Mike Miller said his experience enlisting in the army deviated from the norm because he joined the military to pursue athletic goals. Miller said he joined the military in 2001 to train as a track and field Olympian — receiving infantry and airborne ranger training in Fort Benning, Ga. then later in Fort Carson, Co.  —  but didn’t move past the Olympic trials.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1976890226\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/jet/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?fit=1280%2C845&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,845\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"CYBERSHOT\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1106704754\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"10.6\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"jet\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?fit=888%2C586&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet-250x165.jpg?resize=250%2C165\" alt=\"\" title=\"jet\" width=\"250\" height=\"165\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29466\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?resize=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jet.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“I took a different route, went to graduate school first,” Miller said. “There was always a void in my life … even though I did what society told me to — go to college, go to graduate school. For me, the military filled that void … People think the military is all about war, but it has unique programs like the World Class Athlete Program.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Game Changer</strong></p>\n<p>The catastrophic events of 9/11 drastically altered the original mindset of most active duty members, pitching their early days of service into discordant confusion.\tRaymond Morua, a third-year political science major, joined the army months prior to the World Trade Center attacks. Morua, who was stationed in Germany for two years, Kosovo for six months and saw active combat duty in Iraq for one year and three months, said his initial plans to earn money for college and learn about different cultures were cast aside after 9/11.</p>\n<p>“When I joined, the invasion hadn’t happened yet — there was no war at the time,” he said. “I thought I would get to travel the world, go learn, get money. It didn’t turn out that way; I didn’t think I would be playing G.I. Joe. It was pretty surreal.”</p>\n<p>Antonio, who joined the Air Force one week before 9/11, said he and his troop waited an additional month before they were able to watch news clips of the terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"709715723\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/lollipops/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=1280%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"CYBERSHOT\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1100822578\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"9.3\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"lollipops\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops-250x187.jpg?resize=250%2C187\" alt=\"\" title=\"lollipops\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“When Sept. 11 kicked off, my platoon thought it was a drill,” he said. “The next thing you know, it was real.

Don’t sit-back — reform is a participation sport, and you’re up to bat.</p>\n<p>We have entered an age where a student who wants an affordable education is considered an extremist.  Next generation’s UC students will pay more than their predecessors for less of an education than the system has ever offered. While the Regents of the University of California and their police cohorts might say that UC students are rebellious gits with no respect for bureaucratic procedure, they have criminalized our inherent right to learn and better ourselves through schooling.</p>\n<p>Our campaign for education was never a radical request. In their fight for the right to education, California’s youth has never asked for more than they were entitled. </p>\n<p>However, to our dismay, the practice of denial and scapegoating has become a staple of behavior from UC leadership.</p>\n<p>We find it absolutely imperative to remind the Regents that the UC is a public institution, and that its mission is to provide an affordable quality education to those who qualify. The Regents have thus far failed in their pledge to adhere to the California Master Plan and support California students as well as uphold their right to an affordable, equal higher education decades ago.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students braved brandished weapons and pepper spray in a commendable but likely futile effort to return balanced decision-making to the UC.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in modern times, our students are persecuted, pepper-sprayed and taunted with handguns whenever they voice their discontent.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s meeting, a police officer pulled a pistol on student protesters. While circumstances are still unclear, the fact of the matter is that a UC police officer pointed a deadly weapon at unarmed students whose only request was to be offered an affordable education.</p>\n<p>Although police presence was requested in the case the protest went awry, yesterday’s violence between law enforcement and students is indicative of a larger desperation that has now enveloped the entire UC system.</p>\n<p>Not only did last year’s 32 percent fee increases break the bank, but Mark Yudof now proposes to add an additional eight percent to that number and raise the total cost of a public education in California to an unprecedented 40 percent over the last two years.</p>\n<p>How far can our pockets stretch? How long can UC executives reach into them to pay for the state’s fiscal mismanagement?</p>\n<p>We understand that money is scarce and times are hard — not just for the UC, but for the nation as a whole. However, this does not excuse a lack of UC investment into the classroom. We are the next generation, and we demand the same access to public education that was given to the generations before us.</p>\n<p>The Board of Regents has consistently passed responsibility for this injustice onto the state, declaring their hands and tongues tied in addressing the matter. But denial can only go so far.</p>\n<p>We have some words for the UC executives who have failed to take the students’ interests into account: take responsibility for your failure to represent us in this economic crisis. Take responsibility for the overwhelmed parents and students, the poorly paid professors, the underfunded programs, the lack of campus resources and the packed classrooms. Recognize that you are indeed the upper echelon of a decision-making process that trickles down into real world consequences for all the students you pledged to serve when you took your position. Realize your potential to change the situation for the better and to ease the sting of the recession for California citizens who deserve an education.</p>\n<p>Students: realize your responsibility to ensure that this change happens. Keep your elected representatives honest, both for your sake and the sake of subsequent generations. Silence is consent in this case, and unless you are enthusiastic about forking over more of your money to the UC Regents, we suggest you speak up.</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s protest was a wake-up call. It serves to remind us of the risks our peers are willing to take to ensure our right to an accessible education is still existent. The risks, consequences and future of a declining and unaffordable UC system are real.</p>\n<p>We are delusional to appreciate the efforts of our UC leadership. Students have every reason to believe that we have been forsaken. The UC was once recognized as an accessible path to higher education; it was once considered an affordable option for a world-class education. Now, elitist values and exclusionary prices ensure that this education is only extended to the rich.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents has failed you.
