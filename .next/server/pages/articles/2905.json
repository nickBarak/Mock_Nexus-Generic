I’ve been this way my whole life. It can be annoying because it’s hard to tell when I’m out of shape until I’m wheezing my way down the grocery store aisle or I’m injuring myself playing FIFA ’11. But this quarter, I’m going to change that. How, you ask? By taking advantage of UCSB’s exercise program.</p>\n<p>It won’t be easy. The 10 a.m. class start times are brutal, the actual exercise itself will be equally torturous and nothing excites coaches more than running fatties such as myself into the ground. Speaking of coaches, here’s the rundown of what I’m looking at:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Kathy Gregory – Elementary Volleyball</strong></p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ very own varsity women’s volleyball coach for the last 35 years. She’s registered over 800 wins, has been with the women’s program since it started and has done color commentary for ESPN. Her nickname is “The Queen,” for God’s sake. Basically, she’s far too qualified to teach me how to play this sport. So far, she’s given me the biggest physical challenge of the three coaches. Those backline-to-net shuffles are killers. But she’s also the loudest, funniest and most charismatic teacher so far. She jokingly yelled at a kid the other day and he looked like he was going to cry. Awesome. Plus volleyball is made for tall people, and I’m tall. No worries here.</p>\n<p><strong>Mircea Badulescu – Elementary Soccer</strong></p>\n<p>A childhood full of golf gave me hand-eye coordination. Foot-eye, not so much. I am also not much of a runner despite my gazelle strides, nor am I very agile. On top of that, this class consists of nothing but playing soccer. No drills, no pointers, just the game. Badulescu seems cool enough, but I don’t anticipate much interaction because he observes rather than teaches. That being said, he has a cool accent, which is a big plus. The wildcard in the bunch, to say the least.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Scatliffe – Intermediate Tennis</strong></p>\n<p>The first ESS class I took at UCSB was beginning tennis. I had no prior skills, but that class was such a fun experience that I decided to take another. Plus, probably due to the hand-eye coordination thing, I had a little bit of a knack for it. That being said, tennis is hard. There’s a lot of stopping and starting again and turning and starting involved. Don’t even get me started on the serves. Scatliffe is the current assistant coach for women’s tennis, and was a player herself from 2004 to 2008. She has youth on her side, which is good in a teacher. We play fun games, she’s already developed a rapport with some kids and is very personable. Spunky, even. But … tennis is hard, man.</p>\n<p>So that’s the rundown. One week in, and I like to think I already feel a little better. Eating ice cream for dinner and downing my fair share of pitchers at Gio’s can’t be helping, but I’m committed to this. I promise to share with you my emotional and physical journey upon which I venture to exchange my man flab for a six pack. Or maybe I’ll just stick with the six-pack of Blue Moons in my fridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

of Theater and Dance received the 2014 50/50 Applause Award from International Centre for Women Playwrights (ICWP) for having more than 50 percent of its produced plays written by females.\n<p>UCSB is one of 67 recipients in nine countries to have won the Applause Award. Out of the six plays produced at UCSB in the 2013-2014 school year, four of the plays were written by female playwrights.</p>\n<p>Department of Theater and Dance Chair Risa Brainin said she is honored that the university is a recipient of the ICWP award.</p>\n<p>“We are very proud to be part of this international movement to create a gender parity across the world,” Brainin said.</p>\n<p>According to Brainin, the Season Selection Committee is an organization that goes over and chooses plays to be produced at UCSB. In 2014, the Season Selection Committee made a conscious effort to produce plays written by women, Brainin said. </p>\n<p>Third-year theater major Charles Grant said the 50/50 Applause Award is a demonstration of the Theater and Dance’s program to provide a wide array of perspectives, particularly from “the female voice” which, according to Grant, “isn’t often heard.”</p>\n<p>“It is also great that our department decided to choose many productions that were written by females because it gives power and voice to the female perspective,” Grant said. “It also gives the opportunity for females cast in those productions to be able to tell those stories that need to be told.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her involvement with the Department of Theater and Dance, Brainin was also named presidet of the National Theater Conference this year, a national non-profit dedicated to support for and advocacy of American theater. According to Brainin, there is a Women Playwright Initiative within the National Theater Conference, which she hopes will influence the department on campus. </p>\n<p>Kris Bauske, Applause Award co-chair and ICWP board member, said the award marks a progressive change in theater, placing the Theater and Dance program at “the vanguard of social change.”</p>\n<p>“The organizations that received the award step out of that comfort zones and say that they are going to challenge the audience to become in tune with the voices of female playwrights and help them to progress along so that they are as interested in plays written by women as they are written by men,” Bauske said. </p>\n<p>However, Bauske also said there is still room for improvement, even within organizations that have received the award.</p>\n<p>“We are pretty much evenly sliced. We are about 50 percent men and 50 percent women. And yet the majority of plays being produced are written by men,” Bauske said. “That tells us that society is putting a lot more importance on stories about men by men for men, or that women are just not having the opportunity to have their voices heard.”</p>\n<p>According to Bauske, consumers of art should be more cognizant to producing stories that women will be likely to value.</p>\n<p>“Typically, the storytellers that I have heard are women,” Bauske said. “It’s not that women are incapable of creating the same art that men are. It’s just that people need to become more attuned with the stories that women find important.”</p>\n<p>Brainin said the Department of Theater and Dance will continue to progress and to produce plays that are written by a diverse groups of people. </p>\n<p>“This year we focused more on writers of color. We want to have a diversity of voices,” Brainin said. “We are focusing on playwrights from different countries, from different ethnic backgrounds.

The Institute is funded by the Office of Hanban, located in Beijing, China, with UCSB matching funds.</p>\n<p>Religious Studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang said she began the process of starting the Confucius Institute in 2010.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy to see that everything is finally in place,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the Confucius Institute would aid graduate students and faculty whose research involves Chinese Studies.</p>\n<p>“Our Confucius Institute will place a special emphasis not only on language teaching, but on research,” Yang said. “We will put a lot of the Confucius Institute’s energies and funds into promoting China Studies on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, more than half of the university’s international students come from China, and the new Confucius Institute will facilitate interaction between Chinese and American students.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to increase the synergy between International Students Studying at UCSB and our own students who have an interest in China,” Yang said. “We will try to hold social activities and scholarly lectures where we bring these two constituencies together.”</p>\n<p>Yang said collaboration between countries like China and the United States is necessary in order to take on global issues such as climate change, terrorism and economic inequality.</p>\n<p>“We have so many global problems that no country can solve,” said Yang. “We all have to come together and deal with our differences — graciously, politely, but persistently — and at the same time try to make stronger bridges so that we can understand each other better and ultimately work together to address these global issues.”</p>\n<p>Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Jian Liu said the Confucius Institute will teach students Chinese languages in order to facilitate communication between China and the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Language is a bridge connecting different countries and peoples,” Liu said. “Confucius Institute has become this for promoting the beautiful Chinese language.”</p>\n<p>Yang also spoke at the ceremony and said the Confucius Institute illustrates the university’s dedication to a global education.</p>\n<p>“Today as we watch the Confucius Institute on campus, we are creating another opportunity for UC Santa Barbara to facilitate cultural exchange, expand our commitment to global education, and extend new learning and research options to our students,” Yang said. “We feel very, very honored to be able to sign this agreement with Shandong University.”</p>\n<p>Chairman of the University Council for Shandong University Shouxin Li said the Confucius Institute on campus is distinct from others in the U.S. due to its academic collaboration with Shandong University in China.</p>\n<p>“Although there are many Confucius Institutes located around the United States, I can assure you that the University of California, Santa Barbara Confucius Institute is unique because it is established through the cooperation between UCSB and Shandong University — a University near the hometown of Confucius,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said he takes pride in the university’s strengths “in Chinese Language, history, living art, culture and society.”</p>\n<p>“We really hope in partnership with Hanban and our distinguished colleagues at Shandong University to build on these strengths and advance study, education and research in these areas for many years to come,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor pro tempore Gregg Hart said Santa Barbara has honored its Spanish history and is happy to see that it is now focusing on the knowledge of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to say that we’ve come to a place where we’re going to respect both historical traditions,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Matt Share, who is in his second year of studying Chinese, said he hopes the Confucius Institute will mean more Chinese language classes will be offered at the university.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the intro Chinese language courses are offered in a one-year sequence, so if you want to take Chinese and you’re at a certain level, but you miss that course because of a course conflict, you have to wait a whole year,” said Share.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chinese international student majoring in economics Xiaoke Ma performed at the ceremony on a Hulusi, a traditional instrument of the Yunnan province in southern China. She said the Confucius Institute would give her the opportunity to share her culture the campus community.</p>\n<p>“I could let my foreign friends know what the Confucius Institute is and I could show them some of my music, like what I did today,” Ma said. “The way I speak, the way I think — it’s really different from what you guys [American students] think.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Dean of the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University and editor-in-chief of China’s <em>Journal of Literature, History and Philosophy</em>, Professor Xuedian Wang said the institute is representative of “a great opportunity to make a commitment” to cultural enrichment.</p>\n<p>“I believe there is huge potential for our inter-cooperation,” Wang said, “So let’s work together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/","id":2903,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2902,2901,2900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Groups that received partially requested funding included the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), Mu Delta, Pilipino Cultural Night and Hong Kong Student Association while one group was not funded.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cheer Team was reallocated $945 out of $1,540 for a cheer competition in Atlanta, GA, that they can no longer attend in order to put that $945 toward going to Cheer Sport, an international cheer competition in Ontario, Canada, in March. The direct remainder of around $600 was allocated toward attending sporting events other than the USA Nationals in Anaheim, which they are still competing in.</p>\n<p>According to Cheer co-Captain Nick Gorton-Bufano, the team reallocated funds to the Ontario trip due to injuries sustained by team members that prevented them from attending the Atlanta competition.</p>\n<p>“We lost six people to injury and personal family matters, so we could not go, so we would like to take the money that we would have used for hotels and put it towards a competition on March 7,” said Gorton-Bufano.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60442\" style=\"width: 374px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60442\" data-attachment-id=\"60442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-entertains-funding-requests/finance-board_will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=3475%2C2306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3475,2306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422899329\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60442\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1-1024x680.jpg?resize=364%2C241\" alt=\"Will Tran/Daily Nexus\" width=\"364\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board_Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>EAP received $250; the Cotillion Dance Club received $1,175 to fund three dancing events at the Hub; the Film Studio received $750 for catering and snacks for an event on Feb. 20 in Pollock Theater and the Iranian Graduate Student Association received $1,300 for food for their New Year’s celebration, typically held on March 21.</p>\n<p>According to a speaker for the Iranian Graduate Student Association, the club had to change their event due to the week falling on the same dates as finals week leading into spring break.</p>\n<p>“We are also offering a culture show which includes dancing and like different traditional music performances also from our culture, so that is where our other money is going.
