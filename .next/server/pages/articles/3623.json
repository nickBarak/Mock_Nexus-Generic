President Ali Guthy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young. The event culminated in a surprise appearance and performance by UCSB alumni and rock musicians Jack Johnson and Animal Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n<p>As the first person to speak at the event, Guthy said “Come Together” was organized in order to honor the memories of six members of “our UCSB family,” — George Chen, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss — by remembering them while moving forward with efforts to improve the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“As a new academic year has begun and we being to focus on the hopes, goals and dreams that lie ahead, we remember them,” Guthy said. “As we take those moments out of our busy day to cherish what it means to be a Gaucho and part of an extraordinary, caring family, we remember them.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, who said he still has “difficulty wrapping [his] head around making sense out of the senseless acts of violence,” of May 23, “Come Together” was formed in order to encourage students to define and determine the character and quality of the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“You students individually and collectively have the ability to make Isla Vista and UCSB the kind of community that is not only extraordinarily beautiful and fun but also safe and healthy,” Young said. “I urge you to seize this moment and begin the important but hard difficult work of reclaiming and rebuilding our community. We got this.”</p>\n<p>After Young and Guthy spoke, Johnson and ALO musically collaborated, giving students a free performance for over an hour and a half. Throughout playing songs such as “Good People,” “Better Together” and “Banana Pancakes,” Johnson and ALO members commented on their time spent in Santa Barbara and reminisced on the fond memories they associate with their former life in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A photo essay related to this article can be found <a

id=\"caption-attachment-64057\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students held a rally on Nov. 20, 2014 against proposed tuition hikes by the University of California Board of Regents, which called for an annual 5 percent increase in tuition over the next five years due to a lack of state funding for the UC. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 150 students from several UC campuses gathered outside the UC Regents meeting Thursday in protest of a proposed tuition hike, forcing the Regents to table its approval until January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents proposed a $280 annual tuition increase for UC students in order to fund more resources for the rising number of students attending UCs. Ralph Washington Jr., UC Davis UC Student Association President, and Erica Perez, UC Riverside Campus Action chair, planned a protest upon hearing of the increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington said the protest was successful in its goal to “bring attention to student perspective,” but the Regents’ decision will be unknown until the meeting in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest began at 8 a.m. with protestors gathered outside the building and chanting at the Regents as they entered. Protesters employed four basic tactics: a banner drop, human chain, spelling out S.O.S. and camping in tents outside the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure students are comfortable at all levels,” Erica Perez said. “Not everyone can come out to say what we do; we’re out there for those that can’t be there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the wellbeing of students, a “wellness leader” handed out water and snacks to protesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions increased during the meeting when Regents attempted to cut it short, much to the dismay of any protesters who had bussed overnight to attend the meeting. Regent John Perez suggested holding another open comment period to hear student concerns, but was denied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things could have easily been smoother if they allowed the students to make a public comment,” Erica Perez said. “They constantly make decisions for us; we need to be included in these conversations all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hope is that we adopt a conversation,” Washington said. “Many students face basic needs insecurity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Food Security and Access Study conducted by the Regents found nearly 20 percent of students face food insecurity, with 42 percent of students in the UC system reporting they had experienced a decrease in quality or intake of food in the last 12 months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a conspicuous problem,” Washington said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have to either think about buying food or paying tuition,” Erica Perez said. “We should not be thinking about sacrificing things to get a higher education … our needs as students aren’t being met, and that’s what frustrates us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Perez and Washington both emphasized the importance of protesting to express student beliefs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I definitely believe that protests can have an affect on a political agenda, and sometimes this is what our education looks like,” Erica Perez said. “Organizing gives you a voice; protests are able to give you a voice where you can express yourself the way you want to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest has been in the planning stages for two months, with weekly conference calls involving several students across the UC. Students discussed logistics and tactics to increase students’ comfort and efficiency as protestors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s beautiful, just to see that students are taking the time,” Erica Perez said in reference to the long meetings. “We don’t see it as work because, when you organize, it’s the passion, it’s something you love to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Regents tabling the discussion on tuition hikes, the UCSB Student Activist Network will be holding a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/walkout-to-defy-possible-uc-tuition-hikes/\" target=\"_blank\"> walkout on Monday </a>to make a statement that tabling the discussion is not enough, and that students want a rollback on tuition prices. Students across the UC system will leave their classes, and students at UCSB will gather under Storke Tower to express their disapproval.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The photo caption incorrectly said the protest was in 2015, not 2014. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The authors of the newly approved laws and other public officials gathered at Anisq’oyo’ Park in I.V. yesterday for a press conference on the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>State assemblyman for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and AB 1014 co-author Das Williams stated that the governor’s approval of the gun violence restraining order is a “huge victory” that empowers law enforcement and family members to take steps to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate press conference that he was inspired to author the bill to address a “gap in the law” that became evident following the events of May 23.</p>\n<p>“As I learned more about the details of this incident and that the family of the perpetrator of this violence had made an effort to alert law enforcement to possible danger, it became clear the system wasn’t set up, directly, to protect us as a community,” Williams said at the press conference yesterday. “In the future, it will be a tool for concerned family members, friends and law enforcement to deal with troubled individuals.”</p>\n<p>AB 1014, which goes into full effect Jan. 1, 2016, authorizes a given court to issue a maximum 21-day “gun violence restraining order” prohibiting the subject of the order from owning or having any access to firearms or ammunition. The issuance of such an order is contingent upon the court’s determination that the subject of the order poses a threat to themselves or others by having access to firearms.</p>\n<p>The law states that gun violence restraining orders can be requested by both an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer. The bill also requires an additional court hearing to be held within the 21-day period to determine whether a year-long order prohibiting firearm access should be issued. Additional year-long orders can also be issued at the court’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate interview that roommates would be able to make a request for the order because under California law anyone living with someone for a minimum of six months also qualifies as immediate family.</p>\n<p>The issuance of a gun violence restraining order would also require that the subject of the order surrender all firearms in their possession. Under current laws, sheriff’s deputies can ask the subject of a welfare check to voluntarily surrender firearms, but cannot seize weapons simply during welfare calls, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said in a prior interview.  “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60-to-90 days.”</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thought the “most important thing” when it comes to addressing existing gun laws is to get Congress to act.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to pass some very good gun laws here,” Williams said in a separate interview. “But at a national level nothing has been done. Sandy Hook, Colorado, our tragedy in Isla Vista, all of this has happened, and while it’s changed the politics of Sacramento it hasn’t changed the politics in Washington at all … so people are gonna have to get angry and demand that change.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh and friend of Christopher Michaels-Martinez was present at yesterday’s press conference and said she believed the bill’s approval is a start to making a difference.</p>\n<p>“Even if it doesn’t make a huge dent in the problem, even if it doesn’t make a huge difference in the bigger issue, I think it’s a start,” Suh said.</p>\n<p>In late August, the families of slain UCSB students Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper wrote a letter to Brown urging him to approve the legislation and emphasized that if a gun violence restraining order had been possible prior to the shooting, lives could have been saved.</p>\n<p>“Nothing we can do will bring back Christopher, but I’m confident this new law will help save lives and prevent other families from experiencing this same kind of tragedy. States around the country should be exploring this life-saving measure,” Richard Martinez said in a statement following the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>SB 505 author and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, said the governor’s approval of SB 505 would better equip law enforcement during welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill will help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Three weeks prior to the Isla Vista shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted assailant Elliot Rodger as a part of a welfare check at his parent’s request, but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. Under the new law, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office will now be required to develop policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms Database prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Hoover said in a prior interview.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56357\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56357\" data-attachment-id=\"56357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/brown-approves-precautionary-gun-laws/legislation-doreen-farr-weiss-and-martinez_10-01-2014_kenneth-song-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=2760%2C1892&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2760,1892\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412172768\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Legislation Doreen Farr, Weiss, and Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth Song – Copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=250%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=888%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56357\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy-1024x701.jpg?resize=888%2C608\" alt=\"Kenneth Song//Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"608\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-56357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, October 2, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Unusually high demand for housing has made it nearly impossible for students to find housing in Isla Vista, Goleta and even downtown Santa Barbara. Some students have resorted to staying in costly motels while they await assistance from the Community Housing Office (CHO), the university administration responsible for helping students find living accommodations.</p>\n<p>According to Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, in her 25 years of working with the CHO she could only recall one other year with a similar housing shortage situation, which was in 1989. According to Akchurin, approximately 100 students are still without housing, a shortage that did not become apparent to the CHO until a month ago.</p>\n<p>“It seemed like a normal year,” Akchurin said, “I’ve been here 25 years, up until August, then right when September hit we started getting phone calls from international students saying housing was tighter than usual.”</p>\n<p>Akchurin said the housing crunch has been the result of a multitude of factors outside of the University’s control.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way bigger issue than just UCSB,” Akchurin said. “There’s City College and Westmont students that impact the market place, as well as an influx of construction contractors working in Goleta that have added to the housing shortage.”</p>\n<p>According to Akchurin, her office has reached out to the broader community to provide housing for many afflicted students.</p>\n<p>“We sent a letter to local folks to ask people to come forward and provide housing, and the response has been amazing,” Aktchurin said. “The community has been great.”</p>\n<p>However, students like fourth-year international business major Daniel Luckyman remain homeless. A transfer student from Germany through EAP, Luckyman said he and another student from Germany have been looking relentlessly for housing for a month now.</p>\n<p>“We came here a month before to find housing,” Luckyman said, “We were here every day checking Craigslist and going house to house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56415\" style=\"width: 206px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1967489030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56367\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56415\" data-attachment-id=\"56415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/eap-students-without-housing/eap-housing-mishap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=1414%2C1802&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1414,1802\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"MG5300 series\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"EAP Housing Mishap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap.jpg?fit=804%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56415 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EAP-Housing-Mishap-196x250.jpg?resize=196%2C250\" alt=\"Upon arriving to Santa Barbara, many EAP students expecting to find university housing found themselves without homes.
