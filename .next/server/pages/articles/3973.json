Senate then voted unanimously to table the bylaw for one week, but senators still did not produce the standard deviation on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>This bylaw has faced significant backlash from (BCUs). Certain BCUs feel that the bylaw negatively affects minority students and that Senate generally lacks communication with BCUs on issues that directly affect them.</p>\n<p>“Of course everyone wants their student fees cut,” Luvia Solis, co-chair for Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.), said.</p>\n<p>n light of the newly passed bylaw, she said she doubts S.C.O.R.E. will have the ability to put on conferences that have been attended annually.</p>\n<p>“In these conferences, it’s the only time when you get to network with other UCs and build coalitions, like for example, now immigration is a really big thing … At the Student of Color Conference there was an immigration caucus, [and] all UC students were working on how to work with the Regents, how to protect our students,” she said. “That doesn’t just happen through Facebook.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of Queer Commission, said a decrease in conference allocations will pull funding from on-campus activities.</p>\n<p>“A lot of other organizations won’t be able to get their conferences, which means they will have to go to other funding groups,” Dumlao said. “Those groups are going to have to spend money that they would otherwise spend on weekly programming events [or] maybe other quarterly events.”</p>\n<p>He also said the funding Queer Commission received for conferences allowed them to put on more local programming for smaller queer groups.</p>\n<p>The bylaw also incentivizes certain post-event obligations. If the campus organization does not submit an event summary within two weeks or hold a workshop within two months, A.S. will place the group on temporary “funding probation,” which will prevent future funding until the requirements are met.</p>\n<p>Hobson said the Finance and Business Committee received only one post-conference report this year.</p>\n<p>Solis said she believes conferences are an investment.</p>\n<p>“Every single student came back to campus and is doing something now,” she said. “You learn things at conferences that you don’t get to learn here, and you always bring it back to your community.”</p>\n<p>She also said students of all backgrounds are welcome to join conferences.</p>\n<p>Both Solis and Dumlao expressed concern that, despite being co-chairs of BCUs, senators did not ask for their feedback even though the bylaw directly affects them.</p>\n<p>“How are you supposed to vote on something you have no idea about; you’re so disconnected,” Solis said.</p>\n<p>Last week, A.S. President Austin Hechler said it is important to communicate with BCUs, and he suggested that honoraria be made contingent on attending BCU meetings. He said it is Senate’s job to communicate, and they are currently failing at doing so.</p>\n<p>Thao Nguyen, co-chair of A.S. Womyn’s Commission, also said Senate has been uncommunicative.</p>\n<p>“A solution would be for them to reach out to us more and for them to involve us in this process before jumping the gun and taking away funding,” Nguyen said. “We’re, like, running around with our heads cut off.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

President Jimmy Villarreal’s veto of two bills at last week’s meeting. Their motions failed to pass.</em> John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S.) Senate met Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to discuss A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s vetoes of two bills.</p>\n<p>The bills, “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund,” passed unanimously at last week’s Senate meeting. Public Forum included multiple College of Creative Studies (CCS) students speaking in support of the bill to establish student government in CCS and the College of Engineering (CoE).</p>\n<p>First-year CCS student Katie Feerst said CCS and CoE are underrepresented on campus, so she supports the bill to establish student government for the two colleges.</p>\n<p>“CCS has existed since 1967. We have been in UCSB for a long time, yet we have yet to have a student council,” Feerst said. “We should all have representation, even if we are smaller than College of Letters and Sciences. We should all be able to integrate as part of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he vetoed the bill because the creation of a student government is a new concept in A.S., so legislation requires thorough editing before passing and becoming part of the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Moving the association to a research-funding academic body — it very much changes what we do,” Villarreal said. “There’s an unnatural connection in what we do here and the educational side of things.”</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said Senate should override the presidential veto because the bill affects CCS students seeking grants for research.</p>\n<p>“There weren’t substantial reasons why it was vetoed, and as senators we could always put forward bills to modify,” Larrazolo said. “The space needs to be created while the momentum is here, and while the entire student population is requesting it.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said although A.S. Senate unanimously supports the bill, it should take the time to perfect the legal framework of creating a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>“We realize the need for representation and for money for these students,” Elyasi said. “They are an underrepresented college. The issue is: where does that money come from and in what way is that money distributed?”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said Senate should not have the power to regulate a student’s research if CCS and CoE governments are formed as A.S. commissions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to say what you can or can’t do,” Ninh said. “We don’t have the understanding that CCS does. I doubt all of us can access the knowledge of what it is to be a CCS student.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said Senate reserves the right to overlook how money is spent, but should listen to the two colleges on how to spend grant money.</p>\n<p>“They know how to spend the money better than we spend the money, so if they recommend that things should be spent on this grant, then yeah I would go with them,” Mariano said. “I don’t believe the senate should not strike minutes, since we are the overseers.</p>\n<p>We look at the money to make sure that the money is spent appropriately.”</p>\n<p>The motions to override the presidential vetoes on “A Bill to Establish A.S. Commissions for the CCS Student Council and CoE Student Council” and “A Bill to Redefine the A.S. S.T.A.R.K Fund” failed to pass.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, October 29 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors filed to place the measure on the ballot in late February, according to documents released to the public during the Community Services District’s (CSD) Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s very likely that there will be a cannabis dispensary in Isla Vista,” said Ethan Bertrand, CSD president.</p>\n<p>Residents of Santa Barbara County will get the chance to vote on Measure T, also known as the Cannabis Operations General Tax, in the June 5 primary election.</p>\n<p>The board voted to endorse the measure with all board members voting in favor except for George Thurlow, who was absent for the meeting.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, any individual who “engages” in cannabis operations, including the “cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling or distributing cannabis” within unincorporated areas of the county would pay a tax on each of the operation’s activities, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>The tax will vary depending on the classification of the business. Nurseries and distributors will pay 1 percent of the total amount an organization receives during its accounting period; manufacturers will pay 3 percent, cultivators will pay 4 percent and retail and micro businesses will pay 6 percent, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor Das Williams, who chairs the county board, said in a written statement that it is “imperative” that the marijuana is taxed to “ensure compliance and to eradicate the black market.”</p>\n<p>“With legalization comes needed enforcement, education and other services. Santa Barbara County needs to tax cannabis growers and businesses to enforce our ordinance and fund other priorities,” he said in an argument in favor of the measure, which he wrote on behalf of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/land-ordinance-limits-marijuana-sales-in-iv-uc-students-opposed/\">passed an ordinance</a> in early February requiring a buffer zone between marijuana dispensaries and areas with schools or daycare centers, meaning dispensaries cannot be located within 750 feet of these “sensitive areas.”</p>\n<p>Opponents of the measure, including District County Supervisor Peter Adam and Susan Brown, retired sergeant from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement that the measure will be “another blank check” for the county.</p>\n<p>“The County faces a $50 million deficit due to misplaced spending priorities,” the group that wrote the opposition statement on the ballot measure. “They want to spend the money how they want it spent, not how we want it spent.”</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board secretary for the CSD, said he is a big supporter of this measure because it is “necessary” for I.V. to have a dispensary one day.</p>\n<p>“The old I.V. residents would have loved to see this happen,” CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
