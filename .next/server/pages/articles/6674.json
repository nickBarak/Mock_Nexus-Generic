His sheer musical talent gives way to an unequivocally enticing and nimble sound. Bird is well-known for his virtuosic violin technique along with expert whistling, vocals and intermittent additional instruments. This previous Saturday, Oct. 14, his cult following did not disappoint, completely filling Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The minute I took my seat, I tuned into anticipation-filled murmurs from the crowd; audience members remarked on Bird’s extensive set-up compared to previous performances. Bird silently arrived onstage as the lights shut off to accommodate his hushed entrance; the soothing sound of his electric violin immediately followed. Bird began with notable pieces from his newest album, <em>Echolocations: River</em>, an eight-track album recorded while he was standing in the Los Angeles River.</p>\n<p>Behind his aslant silhouette on stage, the visual recording of <em>Echolocations: River</em> played on a backdrop. Bird plays the violin in sequence with the video projection. The violin’s ring bounced around the auditorium, a soft bowing along with poignant staccato. I wondered why Bird did not play the entirety of the melodies live until I grasped that he was acting as his own “echo” for the astonishing live experience of<em> Echolocations</em>. He focuses on reverberating to his own tracks, allowing for a sweet-sounding resonance. After playing roughly three tracks of his newest album, Bird reverted to performing <em>Echolocations: Canyon,</em> part one of his newest album. At this point, the backdrop began to project bright lineaments that coalesced, representing the landscape corresponding to each album title. The mesmerizing, contouring lines morphed exquisitely to complement the music of Bird’s violin.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It wasn’t until his debut of <em>Echolocations</em> came to a halt that Andrew Bird began to speak, enchanting the audience with his soft and somewhat carefree voice. He informed the crowd that he worked with NASA in order to contrive the rather hypnotic backdrop by using geodata to contrive a three-dimensional spatial render of the locations in which <em>Echolocations</em> (part one and two) were recorded.</p>\n<p>Bird then transitioned from<em> Echolocations</em> to what he considered a more traditional setting, inviting two of his other band members, drummer Abraham Rounds and guitarist Alan Hampton, to the stage. He enthused the audience with a seven-minute rendition of “Capsized”, accompanied by pleasing effervescent light transitions behind him. Bird confidently moved through several pieces, including “Why, Are You Serious,” Roma Fade” and an upbeat unreleased song.</p>\n<p>“Why,” one of his more popular songs, is revered for its dreamy tone and aloof vocals that blend fittingly with the song’s lyrics. He admitted the second-person narrative of the song that sings “How I wish it was your temper you were throwing / Damn you for being so easygoing” is actually a reflection on his own passivity. This comic self-deprecation roused laughter from the wholly involved crowd.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79211\" style=\"width: 1151px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1099169906\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79210\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79211\" data-attachment-id=\"79211\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/andrew-bird-soars-with-melodic-sounds-at-campbell/unnamed-47/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1141%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1141,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C934&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79211\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C934\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1141&amp;ssl=1 1141w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=238%2C250&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C808&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=974%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Bird topped the series of fan favorites with the quirky and generally adored “Roma Fade.” “That song is incredibly difficult to play,” Bird admitted at the end of “Roma Fade.” He then brusquely unplugged his electric violin and moved over to an intimate acoustic setup on the side of the stage.</p>\n<p>The next series of songs were an incredibly moving and expressive bunch, including “My Sister’s Tiny Hands,” “Orpheo” and “Three White Horses.” For these songs, the mood shifted to a more folkloric, tale-telling atmosphere. Bird showed clear emotional divestment through this acoustic performance; the soft vibrato of his violin allowed for an immense melodic anticipation.</p>\n<p>He ended the show with the highly awaited “Pulaski at Night.” Unfolding the story behind the song, Bird said, “It was [inspired by] a foreign exchange student visiting us from Thailand who said, ‘I want to see ‘Pulaski at Night.’ ” This statement was followed by bursts of laughter. Bird himself found this to be amusing because “Pulaski” is “a fascinating street that runs the whole length of Chicago and the whole west side — but it’s a tough street, he disclosed.</p>\n<p>I gave Bird a standing ovation at the conclusion of “Pulaski,” a song I had been waiting to hear all night. He thanked the crowd for a wonderful night and humbly walked off stage. My expectations were exceeded by his talent and capability to put on a fascinating show. But as I looked at T-shirts being sold near the exit, I heard the soft sigh of his violin return from inside. I quickly made my way back into the venue to witness Bird playing a cover of Neil Young’s “Harvest,” as well as his own “Danse Caribe.” Bird undoubtedly gave an exceptional show filled with finger-pickings, new songs, talented vocals and homages to favorite artists.</p>\n<p>I had a chance to speak with Jenny, a recent graduate and engineer as well as a six-year-long fan of Bird, after the show. She remarked that “Pulaski at Night” as well as <em>Echolocations: River </em>were a surprise to her, proving the ingenuity of Bird’s performances.</p>\n<p>Bird’s fans “bowed down” to his impressive sound-craft and engaging performance. I was personally amazed by the gentle yet incredibly passionate musicianship I experienced during the acoustic segment of the concert. His live songs were performed with a unique timbre, paralleled by recorded versions, giving an extremely genuine touch to the performance. The same way Bird is able to merge the manifestation of multiple instruments, he is able to mingle multiple genres into one whole.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

Even as baby-faced high school seniors, their talent was evident; friends, family and classmates alike packed the legendary Sunset Strip hotspot to support the band, who was then playing under the name The Narwhals. Now, the three are filling venues once again — now as Wallows — but this time selling out clubs and theaters to obsessed fans and total strangers. Following their meteoric rise to stardom, the three childhood friends have embarked on their very first North American tour, which kicked off Jan. 24 in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Minnette, Preston and Lemasters backstage at Velvet Jones ahead of their Jan. 30 show in Santa Barbara. The boys, sporting week-old facial hair indicative of the novelty of tour life, spoke with awe over the ability to live out their longtime dream of touring.</p>\n<p>“We have new music coming out soon, so it’s great to have something to promote and play,” Minnette said. Lemasters spoke of how embarking on a tour had never been an <em>if</em>, but rather a <em>when</em>. “Since we were growing up we were always wondering when we would be touring, and you never know when that’s going to happen,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Though Wallows is technically a new band, the three have been playing as a group since they were 13 years old. Different stages of their lives have warranted changes in name (from The Feaver, The Narwhals, finally to Wallows), but only now have they considered making conscious changes to their sound. “Naturally when you’re 15 you’re going to be listening to different things and feeling different things. When you’re 21 and 22 you’re going to be feeling different things. Maybe now and in the years to come it will be more of a conscious evolution,” Lemasters explained. Preston joked, “Yeah, we’re going to change the band name every couple of years.”</p>\n<p>While the band is content in working alone at the moment, they have entertained the idea of dream collaborations, including Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and multi-instrumentalist (Sandy) Alex G. They all agree that they would be thrilled to have “a fire rap verse” from Tyler, The Creator, and definitely wouldn’t say no to a Kanye-produced track. As for influences, Preston cites longtime inspirations Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and more recently The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys and Arcade Fire. Additionally, Minnette believes that Frank Ocean is “the most exciting person in music right now,” which is met with nods of approval from Preston and Lemasters.</p>\n<p>As openers Nucklehead and Precious Kid wrapped up their sets, the crowd grew anxious for Wallows to take the stage. But the band, seemingly immune to the unruly crowd’s impatience, harmonized backstage to Father John Misty’s “Chateau Lobby #4.” Emerging from backstage, the band was greeted with a mob of screaming fans packed like sardines up into the balcony of Velvet Jones. They kicked off their hour-long set with sleepy single “Uncomfortable,” which was met with enthusiasm from the crowd.</p>\n<p>In what turned out to be a surprisingly delightful artistic decision, the group experimented with trumpet and tambourine throughout the performance. In an impressive display, Minnette showed off his uninhibited dance moves, dropping to the floor and dancing with sunflowers gifted by a fan, all while maintaining a hold on his guitar.</p>\n<p>Screams of excitement erupted from the audience when Minnette announced they were to play a brand new song, and it was no disappointment. In one of the highlights of the show, Minnette and Lemasters showed off their impressive vocal ranges, with the latter breaking into a particularly captivating falsetto. Noteworthy drumming by Preston got the entire crowd dancing, even starting a conga line from the backstage area that snaked its way around the venue and up into the balcony.</p>\n<p>Minnette cautioned everyone to be careful following an especially rowdy mosh pit, which impressed fourth-year biochemistry major Sam Phillips. “The female-majority mosh pit was really progressive and really representative of Wallows’ image,” he said.</p>\n<p>Riding on the crowd’s energy, Wallows covered classic Violent Femmes banger “Blister in the Sun,” which spurred crowd-surfing and more moshing.</p>\n<p>The band closed out their set with singles “Pulling Leaves off Trees” and “Pleaser,” switching up the usual lo-fi sound for heavy drums and bass paired with strong vocals.</p>\n<p>Bowing to the demands of the audience, the band returned for an encore, which was far more low-key and personal, ending the set on a high note. Overall, fans were pleased with the performance. Referring to the mixed crowd of fans of the band and fans of the Netflix hit show “13 Reasons Why,” (in which Minnette stars as Clay Jensen), Phillips noted, “It was an interesting intersection between TV pop-culture and music pop-culture.”</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major Jackson Smith was thoroughly impressed by the variety Wallows displayed in their repertoire. “What stood out was the difference between each song, when it would go from a chill, mellow vibe to a faster pace. I enjoyed how the crowd evolved with the music,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the band, along with their friends and families, watched the crowd exit Velvet Jones from atop Ablitt Tower, they reflected on the night, expressing appreciation for the enthusiastic crowd — the majority of which were college students and young adults. However, this should come as no surprise; though they are still on the rise, they have the star power and work ethic that will take them far. Wallows is only going up from here.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

all-female quartet with a unique kind of spice and punch unmatched by anyone else in the current indie music scene. What sets Hinds apart from so many others is their spirit that they successfully manage to communicate through their lo-fi, garage rock sound.

Since 2015, these ladies have collaborated with other bands like The Parrots, sold exclusive limited edition merch at Urban Outfitters and played in multiple music festivals like South by Southwest and Burgerama. During a live performance on Seattle radio station KEXP, Cosials even recalls their experience of South by Southwest by explaining, “We did 16 shows in four days, we’re so proud of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With influences like Mac DeMarco, The Strokes, Ty Segall and The Vaccines, these ladies know how to create a groovy tune while simultaneously attacking their music and lyrics with a raw, feminine edge. Their newest album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Don’t Run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explores the difficulties and confusions that come with falling in love and presents its listener with rather realistic feelings of self-doubt, longing and vulnerability. For example, their leading single from this sophomore album, “New For You,” describes a desire to become a new, better version of yourself in the name of love. Lyrics like “Because I wanna be somebody new for you” and “Because I only wanna dream if you’re by my side” display a serious love and commitment for someone in the simplest way possible. As seen similarly throughout their entire discography, these Hinds lyrics cut right to the point and make it clear what they want to say. It’s because of this naivety and simplicity of theirs that so many fans are able to let loose, rock out to their music and feel a real connection to the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hinds is far from being the perfect band, their potential for greatness is as apparent as the sky is blue. It’s uncertain whether these Spanish gals will take over the charts in the near future, but it is clear their mere presence in the male-dominated music industry stands as an inspiration for female artists everywhere.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clad in a camo suit and a shirt emblazoned with a mountain scene, JT touted his new hipster-meets-mountaineer persona, which has accompanied his recently released (and not very good) album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man of the Woods</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The choice of Timberlake as singular ringleader of the biggest entertainment event of the year has left many baffled, as his only memorable track in recent years, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” is from the soundtrack to “The Trolls” — an animated children’s film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timberlake is an undeniable entertainer, but has more recently shined greater on stages like “Saturday Night Live” than in concert venues. While relevance is not a prerequisite for halftime supremacy, usually only artists with legendary status can pull off a show without it (see Madonna’s 2012 show). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make matters worse, Timberlake’s history with the Super Bowl, 2004’s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nipplegate,” set the stakes for the show very high. A Prince hologram, which went against the music legend’s wishes, was also rumored to make an appearance. Timberlake needed an extraordinary spectacle that could take his audience out of this world, but he only delivered a low-energy performance which lacked the transformative powers the Super Bowl halftime show is known for. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of five artists who could have delivered that energy and put on a more relevant and compelling show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rihanna </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Rihanna has not performed at the Super Bowl seems almost sacrilegious at this point. Rihanna has continually proven to be one of this generation’s most compelling performers, and with 14 No. 1 singles, she has an endless catalog of songs to perform. Despite not releasing an album since 2016’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rihanna was still 2017’s most-streamed female artist on Spotify. Her feature on DJ Khaled’s “Wild Thoughts” was compelling enough to earn the DJ a performance at the 2018 Grammys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I repeat</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rihanna got DJ Khaled to the Grammys.

His headlining performance at last year’s Coachella and performances at this year’s Grammys, College Football Championship and VMAs all prove his ability to deliver a high-profile, awe-inspiring show. In 2018, Kendrick has already dropped three massive singles from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, which he is producing, giving him more than enough new exciting material to perform, not to mention the potential for guest appearances from The Weeknd and SZA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kendrick, the complete opposite from apolitical and stagnant Timberlake, could deliver a performance which would not only recognize the recent shift towards rap in pop music but also deliver a relevant statement on the state of America, one the NFL would be wise to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cziv-WGRLcE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P!nk, who performed Sunday’s national anthem (under the duress of the flu no less), is a pop star who has stood the test of time. Her music catalog has spanned almost two decades, and she continually cranks out hits, including this year’s “What About Us.” While a figure from Timberlake’s time at the charts, P!nk has continued to stay relevant and has managed to keep churning out a fresh sound. Plus, her passion for high-flying acrobatic performances would no doubt excel in a giant stadium venue.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2woDr_ozkU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn’t love Drake? Serving as our generation’s resident sad boy crooner, Drake knows how to keep America entertained. While not always the most innovative artist, there’s a reason Drake can release near identical songs year after year and still make it into our playlists. He’s got a formula and it works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His recent surprise release EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Hours,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has already produced the No. 1 single, “God’s Plan,” which has already situated itself as the anthem of 2018. Drake’s voice is enough to unite America, and a Super Bowl performance that coincided with his newly released tracks would generate unfathomable hype that would energize any crowd — something JT just could not do.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0uiw4xE7Cs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet Jackson </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as Timberlake was announced as the halftime headliner, an uproar was sent throughout the musical universe. At the 2004 halftime show, as JT and Jackson finished the show to Timberlake’s recent hit “Rock Your Body,” Timberlake tore off a segment of Jackson’s costume, which led to the infamous wardrobe malfunction, Nipplegate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the aftermath of the incident, Jackson’s career suffered as the media allocated her with almost all blame, while Timberlake’s career escaped unscathed. Fans on Twitter acknowledged the incident and supported the music legend by tweeting #janetjacksonappreciationday on Sunday. In the context of the recent #metoo and #timesup movements, an appearance by Jackson would be a timely statement on the systematic biases which women are subjected to, and a moment of redemption for a music legend. Both would offer more excitement and spectacle than Justin Timberlake’s tepid voyage through his musical catalog.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzC78pNk0MM</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/5-acts-who-could-have-delivered-more-than-jt-on-super-bowl-sunday/","id":6673,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6672,6671,6670],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
