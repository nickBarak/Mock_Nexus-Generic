\r\n</script> \n<p>Last year, the Bisons finished 19-1, beat a UC Davis squad that made it to the round of 64 in the NCAA Tournament, finished one game out of first place in the Summitt League and made it to the quarter finals in their conference tournament before getting upset by Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>In comparison, UCSB only finished 6-22 last year and came in dead last in the Big West, making it the only team to not qualify for the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time the team missed the conference tournament since 1998.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Pasternack and fans alike, the team has changed drastically from last year both in terms of new players and just being healthy.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest storylines this year is going to be the return of senior guard Gabe Vincent, who consistently has been the team’s best player since he arrived three years ago.</p>\n<p>How he responds to coming back from a season-ending injury remains to be seen, but the production of the team is definitely going to be linked with his production.</p>\n<p>Last year Vincent led the team in points (295) and points per game (14.8) at the end of the season, even though he missed the last eight games. Despite coming back from injury, the media surrounding the Big West conference still respects Vincent’s game, as he was one of the six athletes named to the All-Big West Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>While he will be better equipped to maintain a high usage rate this year, one of the main focuses of the team is going to have to be looking for increased offensive production from other players to provide a supporting cast.</p>\n<p>Both of the new offseason graduate pickups, Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, will play an integral role in making this happen.</p>\n<p>During King II’s two years at Brown, he averaged 14.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, and while his numbers did drop his last year with Nevada, if he can get them at least closer to what they used to be, he will be a big boost to the Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>While the forward wasn’t able to provide any scoring in his exhibition game debut going 0-4 from the field in 13 minutes of play, he did rebound well finishing with four, second most for the Gauchos, and defended hard.</p>\n<p>What he lacked offensively was picked up by the other transfer, Marcus Jackson, who scored 14 points on 6-11 shooting in his first game with UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jackson has already played a decorated career at Rice, where he made the second most three-pointers in school history and scored over 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>Adding another veteran presence to the starting lineup will certainly help communication, something that a team that last year ranked in the bottom half of the league in three-pointers given up, points given up and opponent field-goal percentage desperately needs.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Gauchos’ opponent on Saturday, it seems that the bulk of the game plan defensively for UCSB is going to be focused on senior guard Paul Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller led the Bison in three-pointers made (74) and both scoring (501) and points per game (16.7) last year.</p>\n<p>He tallied five assists in NDSU’s exhibition win against Concordia-Moorhead this year and, along with the rest of the Bison offense that scored 74.8 points per game last year, should offer a good first test for the Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>Miller was also voted to the preseason All-Summit League First Team for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Another notable returner will be senior combo guard/forward A.J. Jacobson, who shot better than 40 percent from downtown last season and has already tallied over 1,000 points as a Bison, becoming the 33rd in history to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>Unlike last Saturday, the match this weekend will count in all facets, including the team’s record, Pasternack’s overall record and, most importantly, how the fans will see this team.</p>\n<p>For a mid-major program, home crowds are everything, which is something Pasternack has routinely expressed. Wins play a huge factor in that role.<br>\nUCSB faces off against North Dakota State at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 11 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Arizona on the other hand, is still looking for its first victory of the year at 0-2.</p>\n<p>“They’ve lost their first two games in overtime, so they’re right there,” Mitchell said. “They’re extremely athletic. They’ll be bigger, stronger, quicker, but hopefully we continue to improve and do what we do well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Saturday’s match-up with momentum after a 76-54 blowout over Occidental in the season opener. With 76 points, the team scored the second-most in the Carlene Mitchell era. Utilizing a fast-paced transition offense which led to 50.8 percent shooting from the field, UCSB went on a 39-10 run to end the first half and begin the second half, taking a 28 point lead that would be too large for Occidental to overcome.</p>\n<p>“We know as a team that we can score and that we’re good in transition,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re small this year, so we have to push the ball and get points off of transition.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Arizona started its season with two close overtime losses to Iona and Michigan. In those two games, the Wildcats were outrebounded by an average of 10 boards, something UCSB would like to take advantage of to jump start its offense.</p>\n<p>“If we outrebound them and limit turnovers, we’ll be good,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “If we get rebounds, we can push the ball and our best offense is when we push the ball.”</p>\n<p>Although Arizona returns four starters from last year’s squad, the team is extremely young with seven of the 12 members listed as underclassmen. Also as a team that isn’t extremely tall, it should be a good match-up for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“They like to push it and everything’s going to and through their guards, so they’re very similar to us,” Mitchell said. “We’ll look to take a lot of switches because their tallest player that’s gotten any minutes is 6’1’’.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats offensively is redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who missed last season with a knee injury. At just 5’5’’, Warthen is averaging 21.5 points, 6.5 assists and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>Other offensive threats include senior guard Kama Griffitts , who as a taller guard averages 15.0 points per game, and freshman forward Dejza James. In her first two games, James scored 11.5 points and five rebounds on 10-15 shooting.</p>\n<p>“The biggest key for us will be defense, like every game,” Zornig said. “Just because it’s Arizona, we’re not looking at them any different than Occidental. We don’t look at the name on the jersey. We just want to go out there and play.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-15/ucsb-welcomes-pac-12-foe-arizone-to-the-thunderdome/","id":611,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[610,609,608],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall Short of Upsetting Arizona","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-bball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-bball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to Arizona 51-49 at the Thunderdome.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pac-12 schools have earned impressive reputations in the sports world.

The basket increased Nesbit’s point total to 18, which led all Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We knew that we had an advantage getting to the rim,” Nesbit said. “I saw a lane and I took it.”</p>\n<p>Down on the other end, freshman forward LaBrittney Jones received the basketball on the right block. As she went up for the shot, she earned the foul call and hit both free throws to give the Wildcats a two-point advantage.</p>\n<p>Arizona ran the clock down to 6.8 seconds by fouling the Gauchos with remaining fouls to give. On the inbounds, senior guard Melissa Zornig got into the lane, but was quickly trapped. She was able to get a shot off, but the highly-contested shot wouldn’t fall, leading to Santa Barbara’s first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“I am a competitor and a sore loser, but as a head coach I am extremely proud of the effort,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “The effort was there. There was no doubt about it.”</p>\n<p>While the contest went down to the final buzzer, the game was not ultimately decided in the final minutes, but rather earlier in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put the Wildcats in the penalty with 8:15 remaining, leading to 15 free throw attempts down the stretch. On the game, Arizona shot 19 free throws compared to just six for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We know the new rule change and we have to make the adjustment. The players have to understand that [the refs] are going to call the hand checks,” Mitchell said. “Arizona was more aggressive attacking the paint. I think at times, we settled for too many jumpers. In our first two games, I think we shot 19 and 21 free throws, so that’s definitely the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Also critical in the loss was the rebounding margin. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half. Twice when the Wildcats headed to the charity stripe, the Gauchos didn’t box out, giving Arizona extra scoring opportunities and erasing the seven point lead UCSB had earned to begin the second half.</p>\n<p>“We probably went a little smaller in the second half. When that happens, we should know we can’t out jump them,” Mitchell said. “You have to make an effort to block out. I think we started trying to tip the ball to ourselves. You can’t do that against stronger athletes.”</p>\n<p>The loss drops Santa Barbara to 1-1 on the season while Arizona earned its first win of the season, improving to 1-2.</p>\n<p>“There are so many things that we could control that would have led to a different outcome,” Mitchell said. “We have to hold ourselves accountable. Give Arizona all the credit in the world. They found a way to win on our court after two overtime losses, but if we could go back and exchange about three or four possessions, that final score would’ve been a little different.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats on the offensive end was redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who totaled 18 points and three assists on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB held Warthen below her season average of 21.5 points and 6.5 assists. Taking the defensive assignment on Warthen was freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe, who, in her first start as a Gaucho, totaled seven points, three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>“[Jemerigbe] brings so much,” Nesbit said. “Her defensive intensity when she comes in, we seem to step it up to another level. We get excited because she’s picking people up 94 feet [from the basket] and she’s pressuring and you can tell their offensive players do not like it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to receive consistent production from their seniors. Along with Nesbit, Zornig tallied eight points, six rebounds and a team-high five assists. Senior guard Destini Mason also added 10 points.</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB will take its first road trip of the season, traveling north to play St. Mary’s on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/","id":612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[611,610,609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Utah State Defeats Shorthanded Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB lost for the first time this season on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season Saturday in a 71-64 loss to Utah State at the Thunderdome. Without top scorer and rebounder in junior center Alan Williams, the shorthanded Gauchos recovered from a 10-point halftime deficit but ultimately fell short against the Aggies.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara fell to 2-1 on the season while Utah State improved to 3-0. Despite playing without Big Al, UCSB managed to stay in the game against a talented Utah State team expected to compete for a shot at the NCAA Tournament this season.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team; they have a bunch of good shooters. They made shots, it’s as simple as that I feel like,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “We needed to make corrections, and we got a little better in the second half. They made more shots than us and we didn’t stop them enough.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Big Al suffered back spasms during pregame warm-ups, forcing him to unexpectedly miss the game. Coming off an impressive victory at UNLV, the confident Gauchos were dealt a serious blow without Williams to go along with the absence of sophomore guard John Green due to injury.</p>\n<p>Down by as much as 14 in the first half, UCSB struggled to shut down the shooters of Utah State for a majority of the game. The Aggies entered halftime with a 39-29 advantage thanks in large part to a pair of senior guards in Spencer Butterfield (16 points and seven rebounds) and Preston Medlin (18 points).</p>\n<p>“I thought the first half they were just nervous without Al and they tried to do too much and they were jittery,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the second half our quickness got them going. We went small and the quickness affected the game. We got some strips, we got out and ran, so it took them a while to adjust to our quickness.”</p>\n<p>Halftime adjustments led to an 11-0 UCSB run to open the second half as the Gauchos took a 40-39 lead. Both teams battled from then on with the Aggies holding a three-point lead with 30 seconds remaining in the game. Utah State made free throws down the stretch however to close the game and secure a victory.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we got out way more in transition than we have in the past. I think we’re a very good transition team,” sophomore forward Sam Beeler said. “The more we can get stops and do all that stuff and get out and run, the more chance we have to make open shots.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led UCSB with 15 points on the night, while Beeler registered 14 points and five rebounds in replacement of Big Al. Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 11 points but was unable to find many open looks from the three because of the absence of Big Al.</p>\n<p>“With Sam and Al in there they definitely have to help down. Al goes down there and he kills. Sam goes in there … and he is bigger and taller and able to go over the top and make shots,” Bryson said. “That presence wasn’t there offensively so we definitely had to try something different this game. We came back but it just wasn’t enough this time.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was one area of strength for Santa Barbara Saturday as freshman Eric Childress and junior Zalmico Harmon combined for nine assists and only one turnover. Childress finished the game with seven points, five assists, four rebounds and two stills. Harmon added six points and four assists.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome, the Gauchos managed to find offensive production despite finding out they would be without their best player minutes before tip-off.</p>\n<p>“[Utah State] never doubled anybody and I thought their gameplan was right on. They adjusted very quickly to what we were doing,” Coach Williams said. “We were doing stuff that we were not prepared to do. We had to do stuff to try to compensate losing Al and losing John. “</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face Colorado on Thursday for a 5 p.m. game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/","id":613,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[612,611,610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
