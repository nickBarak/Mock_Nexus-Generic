Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/","id":4334,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4333,4332,4331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee","biography":"Not available","articles":[2279,2302,2305,2319,2335,2884,3648,3726,3735,3748,3754,3758,3930,3931,3944,3947,3968,4295,4305,4308,4327,4334,4340,4811],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"New Light Fixtures To Be Installed in I.V.

Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’Oyo’ Park, Children’s Park and Estero Park are among other proposed locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould explained that electrical boxes have already been installed in the ground at People’s Park by Embarcadero Hall and I.V. Clinic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground trenches to power two electrical panels have also been constructed that run from two cement access points in the ground.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gould, the electrical panels are scheduled to be installed in April and will allow bands to come and perform at People’s Park without needing to bring in a generator for power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The electrical lines installed will also help bring light to Perfect Park, which is located next to People’s Park, Gould added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding for these new improvements will be coming from Measure O that was on the ballot last May for I.V. voters for the 2017 Santa Barbara County Elections. Lebell said the measure was a response to the expiration of a “consolidated bond” established in 1999 that taxed each bedroom in I.V. an extra $28 a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bond was paid off, instead of allowing this tax to expire, the IVRPD held a special election in June of 2017 that proposed keeping the tax at the same rate for an additional 10 years, but this time to have the money go toward park improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure O gives the IVRPD about $250,000 a year to apply towards park enhancements, Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD is also hoping to install new lighting on the basketball courts at Estero Park, located off of Camino Del Sur.

Last season, Santa Barbara beat USC twice in the regular season but ultimately, the Trojans were the team that knocked the Gauchos out of the Lake Elsinore Regionals.</p>\n<p>Remembering this, UCSB will be motivated to play USC regardless of its slow start to the season. And again it would be smart not to underestimate this team as it does have solid pieces.</p>\n<p>As a team the Trojans are batting a solid .303 from the plate, good enough for fourth in their respective conference. They are also tied for first in home runs as they have hit 15 out of the park this year.</p>\n<p>The offense is carried by many players on this team such as is senior infielder AJ Ramirez who leads the team in RBI (20). Another senior helping lead the charge is outfielder David Oppenheim who leads the team in batting average (.413).</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Trojans have struggled boasting a team ERA of 4.26 which ranks seventh in their conference. Pitching for USC Thursday will be right-hander Kyle Davis.</p>\n<p>The senior has struggled a bit this season allowing 36 hits and 17 runs in 35 innings pitched. Davis comes into the Thursday match-up with an overall record of 2-3 on the season as well as a less than stellar 4.37 ERA.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the opponents that knocked them off last year, the Gauchos will need to continue its hot hitting from Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The best thing about UCSB this season is that everyone on its team can go off at any moment and have a spectacular hitting day. This was the case on Tuesday’s game as redshirt junior Devon Gradford had a great game batting 3-4 (.750) and four RBI.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams also had a big day batting a perfect 3-3 (.1000) and one RBI while also scoring four runs. Junior shortstop Clay Fisher also helped going 2-4 (.500) with one RBI and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>This series will be important for the Gauchos. Not only will it be a chance to get some payback for last season, but it would also keep the momentum high.</p>\n<p>UCSB is off to one of the best starts in school history and has shocked many people with its great play. It must stay on track and continue to garner the national attention it deserves so far this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next series is against USC which begins Thursday, March 24 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m. Friday’s game will be at the same time and place as Thursday, however, Saturday’s match will be at USC’s home turf, Dedeaux Field, at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

administrators agreed to during the sit-in. The demand states that the university will work with the CSD to document the number of sexual assault incidents in Isla Vista, as well as the number of events centered on sexual assault education.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand suggested a three-pronged approach that includes using cumulative sexual assault incident statistics from 2016 and 2017, a list of sexual assault services and service providers and an overview of developing programs and ongoing efforts toward combating sexual assault.</p>\n<p>This plan, while deviating from the plan originally suggested by UCSB alumna Ro’Shawndra Earvin during the May 2017 sit-in, still focuses on the “end-all, be-all” goal of the sexual assault report card, but starts instead with a framing of the climate in Isla Vista, CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“We need to have an agreement on what the numbers are before we can go anywhere with the problem, because the I.V. CSD is not going to solve sexual assault in Isla Vista tomorrow,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While the report card’s completion does not have a set deadline, Brandt said the biweekly meetings will allow community directors to work on the project.</p>\n<p>“It will definitely be made very public once it’s done. I think that we’re still in our preliminary conversations about that, but it looks like it’s one of our staff’s top priorities right now,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Brandt called the action taken on the sexual assault report card as a “starting point” toward solving the issue of sexual assault in I.V.</p>\n<p>The next steps in addressing this issue involve expansion of the UCSB Community Service Organization Safety Stations, he said.</p>\n<p>“The community trusts [CSOs] more than they trust the police when it comes [to] sharing information, and I think that expanding that would be a good piece of the puzzle that we can play,” Brandt said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
