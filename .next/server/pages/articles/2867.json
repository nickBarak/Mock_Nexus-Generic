He’s unreal.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s road to Santa Barbara began in Serbia, where he played for Partizan — the premier water polo club of Serbia. Golic was also part of the junior Serbian national team where he won a European Championship, essentially making him a part of the best junior team in the world.</p>\n<p>Golic’s club traveled to Florida to play in a water polo tournament, where he met Drac and Janson Wigo, younger brothers of UCSB head coach Wolf Wigo. The Wigo brothers helped Wolf, who went against popular opinion, and recruited Golic.</p>\n<p>“Everyone told him to recruit this other kid,” Golic said. “I had less than a 50 percent chance [of coming to UCSB]. But he [Wolf] understood my madness.”</p>\n<p>Wigo’s decision paid off in the long run. Golic scored 53 goals his freshman year and was named All-American Honorable Mention. He then lead the country in goals scored the next two years on his way to being name to the All-American First team both years. This year, he has already broken the UCSB all time record for career goals, which stood for 27 years and currently leads the conference with 45 goals.</p>\n<p>“He is the best [player] in the nation for sure,” Vincze said. “When he has a great day he is unstoppable and when he doesn’t, he is still really great.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, Golic loathes swimming.</p>\n<p>“I love everything else about water polo,” Golic said. “But I hate swimming. Everybody should know that.”</p>\n<p>However, Golic has not allowed his hatred for swimming to stop him from working hard and influencing the team. The captain’s intensity is relentless and he always expects the best out of everyone, especially himself.</p>\n<p>Golic has been known to scream in Serbian at himself when he makes a mistake.</p>\n<p>“I yell at myself and curse at myself,” Golic said. “It motivates me to push myself harder and get better.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s habit has become quite entertaining to the team, but his use of Serbian is not limited to his little outbursts. Ever since freshman defender Lazar Komandinic, a fellow Serbian, came to the team, the use of Serbian has dramatically increased in practice.</p>\n<p>“The official language of practice is Serbian,” Vincze said. “You hear more Serbian words in practice than English.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s intensity and success extends past the water all the way into the classroom. Despite struggling to learn English upon arrival, Golic has found success through his ability to organize.</p>\n<p>“It used to take me two hours to read what would now take five minutes,” Golic said. “[But] I figured out ho to organize myself … Organization for sure.”</p>\n<p>Now Golic, along with Vincze, has the top grade point average in the entire athletic department.</p>\n<p>“He is very competitive in the classroom,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “Not all athletes can [translate] that athletic intensity into studying.”</p>\n<p>Although Golic has the talent to play professionally, the Serbian native plans on hanging up his Speedo at the end of the year to pursue a masters degree in finance. He has applied to the best finance programs around the world, including schools in England, France and, of course, here in the United States. Some of his top choices include Harvard and Princeton.</p>\n<p>“He is destined for great things,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>Golic and the water polo team play the second of their four-game road trip against Berkeley on Nov. 6.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/","id":2867,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2866,2865,2864],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson","biography":"Not available","articles":[268,446,449,1322,2157,2762,2787,2867,2919,5236,5246,5247,5248,5249,5250,5251,5252,5253,5261,5268,5270,5271,5272,5273,5274,5275,5550],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting proposes A.S. Program Board concert during Deltopia at beginning of spring quarter, comes back to the 24-hour café in library and plans for upcoming trip to Ferguson, Missouri. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate had their last meeting of the quarter last night in the Flying A room at the UCen where senators discussed alternative programming for the anticipated Spring Quarter event Deltopia, increased funding for mental health services at all UCs and passed several bills and a resolution.</p>\n<p>Bills passed included a bill to incorporate Isla Vista Arts into A.S. and a resolution to examine the feasibility of an A.S.-administered street cleaning and repaving program for I.V. The Isla Vista Arts bill authorized the creation of an administrative unit of A.S. to oversee artistic projects in I.V.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) member Jeremiah Copeland discussed the organization’s plans for an upcoming alternative spring break trip to Ferguson, Missouri, where students will conduct community service and attend educational workshops. Copeland said C.A.B. had 170 applicants apply for alternative break this quarter — the most the organization has ever had — and settled on 12 participants.</p>\n<p>“We just finalized our paperwork, we will be going to Ferguson for spring break. It will be one-third traditional community service, one-third civic engagement, and the last third will be attending workshops,” Copeland said. “We will be going with BSU [Black Students Union]; they’re sending a 15-person delegation as well, so we’re really excited to work with them.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board commissioner Benjamin Simons said Program Board plans to hold a concert during Deltopia and praised university administration for their cooperation with Program Board efforts.</p>\n<p>“We will, in fact, be having a show on Deltopia night in the Thunderdome, the artist will be announced later. We will be selling five-dollar tickets just like we did for Halloween. Tickets go on sale when we get back from spring break,” Simons said. “I’m really, really hoping that this is the stepping stone that we need to solidify this type of interaction happening where the university sees the problem and asks, ‘How can we help?’”</p>\n<p>Simons also discussed conversations he has had with the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) following musician Mac Demarco’s detainment at the Hub during his Fall Quarter concert. According to Simons, Program Board is working to use more private security at concerts with less police enforcement in the future.</p>\n<p>“I attended a meeting with UCPD as well as all vending managers to discuss the events that happened last quarter,” Simons said. “It was a very difficult conversation, but what I got out of it was some progress. It seems like concerts now will see more hired security rather than the police.”</p>\n<p>Senator and UCen Governance Board member Zach Goulhiane updated the Senate on the introduction of a 24-hour café pilot program in the library during dead week and finals.</p>\n<p>“The 24-hour café starts next Monday and goes through finals on Thursday,” Goulhiane said. “So it will be open until 6 a.m. and will be closed for two hours for restocking and then will open up again.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology and political science double major Cameron Schunk said university administration is creating an alternative Deltopia programming event to encourage students to stay out of I.V. during that time period.</p>\n<p>“The feeling that I’m getting from the university is that their response is trying to pull students out of Isla Vista onto campus during Deltopia,” Schunk said. “I think a large part of that strategy is so that UCSB students won’t be getting in trouble, arrested, et cetera.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also discussed the EVPLA office’s interactions with local police and his proposals to encourage a safer Deltopia, including police-issued warnings to party hosts to prevent large crowds from forming.</p>\n<p>“What we asked was for the police to come by before the parties need to be shut down to provide warnings to all the students and then shut down parties at random so there isn’t a huge mass of people at one end [of Del Playa Drive],” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>UC Student Association (UCSA) Student Observer for the UC Regents Committee on Health Services and fourth-year psychology major Alex Hill gave a presentation urging senators to support increased mental health funding. Hill’s proposal outlined plans to create a more diverse pool of UC mental health professionals, lower wait times for mental health services, increase limits for the number of counseling sessions students are allowed and increase access to mental health care for all UCs.</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed two bills with no conflict: a Bill to Incorporate Isla Vista Arts into ASUCSB and a Bill to Further Revise AS Legal Code Table of Contents.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Arts bill seeks to facilitate student-initiated performing and visual arts organizations that enable “positive social change” in I.V. The proposed Isla Vista Arts bill will support free and low cost events including films, theatrical performances and other arts programs for both students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The Board said they will fund Isla Vista arts and culture programs including WORD Magazine, Isla Vista Arts BOX, Shakespeare in the Park and Nuestra Voz.</p>\n<p>On the Bill to Incorporate Isla Vista Arts into ASUCSB, Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said she was excited for the adoption of the program.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll have a new unit,” Mancini said. “We worked really hard on this bill.

Following his retirement, I decided that Larry Fitzgerald would be ok, that even without Warner he would still have an elite level season. I thought that even if Matt Leinart didn’t get the job, someone would be able to get the ball to Fitzgerald. So I drafted him. And you know what? I was wrong.</p>\n<p>This season, with the revolving door that has been the Arizona Cardinals’ quarterback position, Fitzgerald has managed just one double-digit fantasy day and has yet to break 100 receiving yards in a game. At this time last year, he had 509 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He currently has 331 receiving yards and just two touchdowns. And as much as it hurts the Cardinals, I think it hurts me more.</p>\n<p>But it is not all Warner’s fault. Oh no, he had an accomplice by the name of Ben Roethlisberger — the quarterback of the Pittsburg Steelers — who was suspended for the first four games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>I knew about his suspension when I drafted Steelers’ receiver Hines Ward. My thinking was similar to what it had been with Fitzgerald that someone would get the ball to Ward. And the upside was that I knew Roethlisberger would eventually return. Once again I was wrong to trust “other” quarterbacks. In the four games the Steelers played without Roethlisberger, Ward had more than three receptions only once, accumulated more than 34 receiving yards only once, and scored just one touchdown.</p>\n<p>In the two games since Roethlisberger’s return, Ward has doubled his total reception yards for the season, scored two touchdowns, and has gotten me a total of 30 fantasy points — 10 more than he got in the previous four games combined. The upside of course is that the season isn’t quite half over yet — I still have a chance to make up for the damage those two have done — but even I’m not happy that Roethlisberger is back. Now it just feels like he’s mocking me.</p>\n<p>Check in next week for my midseason fantasy report to see who had a great first half and who would rather be drinking their sorrows away in Isla Vista on Halloween.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills. He plays for the Bills, I know, but over his last four games he has racked up 20.5 fantasy points, which is more than guys like Peyton Manning and Drew Brees. I’m not sure he’ll keep it up for the rest of the season, but there isn’t any indication that he won’t, and with Tony Romo out for the season, I’m sure a good deal of you people are in need of a quarterback, and Big Fitzy can still be found on free agent lists in 95 percent of ESPN leagues.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Josh Greenberg’s Halloween is completely ruined by his sub-.500

held a discussion led by professors of film and media studies Lisa Parks and Jennifer Holt on former system administrator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Edward Snowden and the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance disclosures in 2013.</p>\n<p>The documentary was shown to a sold-out theater and followed the first interactions between NSA analyst-at-the-time Snowden, filmmaker Laura Poitras, who directed the film and then-journalist for the <em>Guardian, </em>Glenn Greenwald. Poitras had been working on a film that tackled the issue of surveillance when Snowden had first contacted her, using the codename Citizenfour. The film examined the United States government’s role in spying on its own citizens and the dangers of such surveillance. After the screening, Parks and Holt began a group discussion about the film and the audience’s opinions on the issue.</p>\n<p>According to Parks, Poitras learned encryption after making the post-9/11 films “My Country, My Country” and “The Oath,” receiving scrutiny and interrogation from the federal government and having equipment confiscated after their releases. Parks said Snowden contacted Poitras because of her familiarity with encrypted communication that would allow them to communicate without surveillance.</p>\n<p>“The whole [film] is a documentary born in encrypted form. It might be one of the first films born in [this form],” Parks said. “We wouldn’t really even see any of this if it weren’t for encryption. The only reason Snowden opens to Poitras is because he knew she knew encryption techniques.”</p>\n<p>Parks said she and Holt were “struck” by the revelations made clear by the film that she believes had previously been unseen and unheard.</p>\n<p>“The hotel room sequence of the film was the material that had not been released before ‘Citizenfour’ hit theaters,” Parks said. “It was this important audio-visual record that shows these conversations that took place between the journalists and the whistleblower.”</p>\n<p>Holt, who teaches media criticism course Film 70, said Americans have become more aware of the inner workings of government surveillance due to Snowden’s 2013 surveillance disclosures.</p>\n<p>“You’re supposed to know more about them [the government] than they are supposed to know about you,” Holt said. “But it’s exactly the inverse these days.”</p>\n<p>Parks said the film highlighted various issues beside privacy concerns including the right to freedom of expression and confidential intergovernmental relationships.</p>\n<p>“We could also extend the discussion … [to] the freedom of speech,” Parks said. “Once you invade people’s privacy, the act of freedom of expression changes. There’s also the issue of the NSA’s actions changing [the] United States’ relationship to other countries around the world, and has fundamentally changed its foreign policy.”</p>\n<p>During the discussion, students raised concerns about the government’s ability to spy on U.S. citizens and Holt said the surveillance apparatus used by the U.S government was expanded with the establishment of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) in 1978, which oversees requests by the NSA.</p>\n<p>“The FISA  court’s powers, which only hears one side which is the government’s side, which never releases any of its proceedings, and never denies any requests for surveillance, [have been] enhanced by an amendment to the original 1978 establishment to approve blanket surveillance,” Holt said. “There’s many dimensions of surveillance infrastructure that we have to think about moving forward.”</p>\n<p>One community member who had lived through the Vietnam era called on youth in the audience to question their government with online and public protests.</p>\n<p>According to Parks, students and Americans must keep open minds as national politics and the world continue to change. Parks said she recognizes the value of looking to history for insight on how to enact change in the modern age. Parks also said individuals need to be open to political and governmental change as well as remember that the American public can be a force to drive that change.</p>\n<p>“I do think a lot of my students may not be out in the streets, but they are definitely formulating political sensibilities and trying to navigate through vast amounts of information — all kinds of different information, gushes of information from the Internet and social media, to figure out how to take a political stand in the world today,” Parks said.</p>\n<p>According to Holt, confronting important issues such as the right to privacy and freedom of speech starts with education.</p>\n<p>“Commit yourself to reading and learning everything you can so you can be an engaged citizen and take action. It can only go from there,” Holt said. “But it can only start from a place of education and awareness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61706\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61706\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/","id":2866,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2865,2864,2863],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
