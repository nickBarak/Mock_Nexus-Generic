Read about their campaign promises and what they plan to do during their times in their respective offices below:</p>\n<p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p>\n<p>Gavin Newsom (D), former San Francisco major and lieutenant governor of California, won the gubernatorial seat in the 2018 midterm election. Newsom campaigned in support of expanding healthcare, diminishing the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) influence on legislation, protecting California’s status as a sanctuary state, closing the gender pay gap and protecting women’s reproductive rights, according to his campaign website.</p>\n<p>His platform consists of expanding economic growth through a new job training system, improving infrastructure and maintaining California values of diversity and social equality.</p>\n<p>He won against his Republican opponent, John Cox.</p>\n<p><strong>Secretary of State Alex Padilla</strong></p>\n<p>Alex Padilla (D) was elected for a second term as secretary of state. During his campaign, he directed voters to his previous terms as secretary of state, state senator and president of Los Angeles City Council.</p>\n<p>Padilla said in his candidate statement that his work in the last four years helped to register millions of eligible voters in California. He pointed to his beginnings as the son of immigrant parents with blue-collar jobs as an indication of his commitment to working-class families.</p>\n<p>He won over the majority of voters against his opponent, Mark Meuser (R).</p>\n<p><strong>California Senator Dianne Feinstein</strong></p>\n<p>Now officially elected to her fifth term in the U.S. Senate, Dianne Feinstein (D) ran on a progressive platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Feinstein cited her experience in the position in previous years for issues including immigrants’ rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and universal healthcare.</p>\n<p>She promised to attack prerogatives of the Trump Agenda such as his anti-immigration policies and proposed oil drilling permits off California’s coast, according to her candidate statement in the 2018 Voter Guide.</p>\n<p>Feinstein won the majority vote against her opponent, Kevin de León (D).</p>\n<p><strong>24th Congressional District Representative Salud Carbajal</strong></p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara alumnus Salud Carbajal won the majority vote for representative of California’s 24th congressional district for a second term. Carbajal campaigned on creating cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to support the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>He pledged to advocate for the middle class, fight for environmental protection, push for safer gun laws and regulations, help to make higher education more affordable, create higher-paying job opportunities and strengthen Medicare and social security.</p>\n<p>He won against his opponent, Justin Fareed (R).</p>\n<p><strong>State Assembly 37th District Representative Monique Limón</strong></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native and Goleta resident Monique Limón won another term as representative of the 37th state assembly district. She campaigned on her years of experience in higher education, especially at UCSB working in various departments to increase diversity and assist in transitions from college to graduate school.</p>\n<p>She promised to advocate for education, defend the environment and expand opportunities for job training and internships, according to her campaign websites.</p>\n<p>She won the majority in a landslide vote against her opponent, David Norrdin (D).</p>\n<p><strong>Goleta Union School District</strong></p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats in the Goleta Union School District race.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure G2018 County Ordinance</strong></p>\n<p>Measure G proposed a redistricting of Santa Barbara County which would be spearheaded by the Santa Barbara Citizens’ Independent Redistricting Commission. The measure will establish clear procedures for determining electoral district boundaries within the county.</p>\n<p>The commission leading the redistricting will be designed to be free of influence from campaign contributors, political parties, special financial interests and more as well as be representative of diversity in the county.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure Z2018 City Goleta Cannabis Tax</strong></p>\n<p>Measure Z passed overwhelmingly in the midterm elections, placing a tax on cannabis businesses in Goleta to provide revenue to be used by the city of Goleta.</p>\n<p>The measure will impose taxes on individual processes of the cannabis industry in Goleta, including cannabis distribution/transportation, cannabis cultivation and cannabis processing/manufacturing. It will exclude the sale of medical cannabis and cannabis testing.</p>\n<p>The tax is expected to go into effect 10 days after the vote is declared by the city council, according to the Measure Z ordinance.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 21]: Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats within the Goleta Union School District.

CSD’s Tuesday meeting, the board discussed further problems with the scooters, as well as the county’s proposed regulation of them.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County first put limited regulations on the scooters back in November, requiring electric scooter companies to obtain encroachment permits to operate within the county’s boundaries among other stipulations.</p>\n<p>The companies are also required to monitor their fleets, retrieve the scooters “as needed” and manage the number of scooters out, according to a press release sent out by the county in early November. The changes went into effect early December.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the county has also approached the idea of parking zones for the scooters, I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>The county will also implement an annual permit fee, a monthly per-vehicle fee and an impound fee for the companies to pay.</p>\n<p>“The county is going to be a lot more active and they’re kind of tying it to the outdoor space,” Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>He noted that the county is taking some of the I.V. CSD’s suggestions into account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the county has now capped the number of scooters per company in I.V. at 200, according to I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that the CSD has also met with Santa Barbara County Supervisor Joan Hartmann to discuss different ways of transportation in I.V.</p>\n<p>UCPD faces its own share of problems when it comes to the scooters.</p>\n<p>Despite the app’s warning that the scooters are not allowed on campus, a threat of a $200 ticket and UCSB’s strict interim policy banning all of the scooters from campus, the department continues to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/ucpd-ups-enforcement-of-electric-scooter-violations/\">impound</a> hundreds of scooters, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>Lime recently picked up 147 of their scooters from UCPD, but there are still currently 253 Bird scooters in impound. UCPD charges the company $24 a scooter to retrieve them.</p>\n<p>Lime has done a better job than Bird of retrieving scooters and communicating with the university, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>A Lime representative has been in touch with Bowman to set up an event in Isla Vista to teach residents how to safely use the scooters, and has even offered to move Bird scooters off campus, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCPD is currently discussing what to do with the scooters that are not picked up by the companies within the allotted time frame. For example, the department has discussed the idea of dismantling the scooters and recycling the batteries, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also created a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\"> policy committee</a> in October to discuss how to address scooters on campus. The committee then floated the idea of geofencing the scooters to help with regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the committee has not yet created a new policy regarding the scooters, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB policy coordinator, ADA compliance and privacy officer.</p>\n<p>“We also continue to keep an eye on statewide concerns and methods of addressing the impacts of the scooters on communities such as ours,” Lofthus said in an email.</p>\n<p>“The committee will convene again at some point in Winter Quarter to discuss but that meeting has not yet been scheduled.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

This this is just a basic payment,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“Public service is absolutely important and we’re privileged to do the work that we do, but we want to make sure that people who want to get involved in their community and serve in this capacity can have at least a little more assistance and financial security.”</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with four yes votes and one abstention by Director Thurlow.</p>\n<p>Directors also have the option to waive their payments or accept the money and immediately return it to the board, an option Thurlow said he would be following.</p>\n<p>There is approximately $16,800 in allocations for the year to compensate directors for their time, according to the I.V. CSD’s 2018-19 budget.</p>\n<p>The board has been discussing this for about two months, following an acquisition of the I.V. CSD’s funding through Measure R, Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD’s policy committee is creating a policy for what can be reimbursed. The committee will discuss this during its Policy Committee Regular meeting on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>“This is something that will make service in the board of directors more inclusive,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“We recognize that we have very limited finances, and we want to be respectful of that while also making sure there’s a basic level of pay to just assist with the incredible amount of work that goes into this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
