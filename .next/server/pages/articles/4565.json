They jumped to a 5-1 lead through the first four innings in an offensive effort that was missing from the Gauchos’ play in the previous two games.</p>\n<p>“We came out and scored early,” senior center fielder Ben Edelstein said. “We had a habit in the first two games of being content with our runs and relying on our pitching. We started [the third game] strong.”</p>\n<p>Senior right fielder Mark Haddow, Edelstein and senior first baseman Trevor Whyte all had multiple hits for UCSB, which recorded 15 hits throughout the game. Freshman Brandon Trinkwon played an outstanding game for the Gauchos, hitting 4-5 with two RBIs and scored three runs.</p>\n<p>“[Trinkwon] had a great game,” senior right-hander Jesse Meaux said. “It’s always good to see freshmen do well. We’ve been expecting it.”</p>\n<p>In OSU’s 11-5 win on Saturday, the team showcased its offensive power in the early innings of the game, scoring four on junior right-hander Matt Vedo in the first inning. Vedo fell to 3-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>“Vedo didn’t have the control he usually has,” Meaux said. “And it’s tough when your bullpen is already in the game during the second inning.”</p>\n<p>UCSB recorded two errors during the game.</p>\n<p>Meaux started for the Gauchos in Friday’s 6-3 loss against OSU.  Beaver pitcher Sam Gaviglio, who entered the series with a 38.2-consecutive scoreless inning streak, allowed two runs in 7.2 innings. In his previous start, Gaviglio pitched a perfect game through eight innings against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB was the first team of the season to score a run on the right-hander.</p>\n<p>“The challenge was to score runs on him, but we wanted to beat him,” Brontsema said. “We scored runs but didn’t beat him; we would’ve liked it to go the other way.”</p>\n<p>Meaux allowed four runs on six hits, walking three batters and striking out one in 4.2 innings. Haddow scored two runs for UCSB and junior Lance Roenicke added two hits, but Oregon State prevailed 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take the field for practice this week in preparation for a game at Loyola Marymount on Wednesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-27/ucsb-avoids-sweep-23-beavers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-27/ucsb-avoids-sweep-23-beavers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-27/ucsb-avoids-sweep-23-beavers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-27/ucsb-avoids-sweep-23-beavers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-27/ucsb-avoids-sweep-23-beavers/","id":4565,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4564,4563,4562],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Season Preview: Team Has High Hopes After Disappointing Play in 2010","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After sweeping La Salle University in its first series of the season this past weekend, the UCSB baseball team earned an 8-4 victory against visiting Westmont College on Tuesday afternoon at Caesar Uy...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After sweeping La Salle University in its first series of the season this past weekend, the UCSB baseball team earned an 8-4 victory against visiting Westmont College on Tuesday afternoon at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

In the interview, Brontsema seemed reluctant to bring up the past at all.</p>\n<p>“We lost some home series last year that were very disappointing,” he said. “Some of those losses outweighed the wins.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finished in fifth place — its lowest conference seed since they finished seventh in the Big West in 2007.</p>\n<p>This year, two teams from the conference have been voted into the top-30 in the nation, according to a national poll by USA Today. UCI is currently ranked #26, while defending Big West Champion Cal State Fullerton is ranked #9. Last season, Fullerton lost only three conference games, including one to UCSB, while second-place Irvine went 17-7. UC Riverside and Pacific finished in third and fourth place, respectively, with records of 13-11 and 12-12.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton is seen as the top team in the conference,” junior Ryan Palermo said. “It’s always a special weekend when we play them.”</p>\n<p>With such a competitive schedule, UCSB has practiced a more disciplined way of playing during practice and game situations.</p>\n<p>“The mentality is to keep the game simple and don’t look too far into the future,” Trevor Whyte said. “The coaching staff has preached the small things.”</p>\n<p>Even playing catch has become a significant factor in the baseball team’s preparation for league play.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about being in a routine, getting into a routine and sticking with it,” Whyte said. “Once you get into conference you already have your routine down.”</p>\n<p>Scouting reports on baseball teams do little to predict another squad’s strategy. UCSB will rely on past experiences with particular teams to understand particular players and patterns on offense and defense.</p>\n<p>“Scouting reports could be on or off,” Whyte said. “Most of it is based off what teams have tried to do in years past. We learn from that and make the adjustments.”</p>\n<p>Adjustments will be crucial to the team’s performance during Big West play, which will provide UCSB with ample competition throughout the coming months.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to playing all [Big West games],” senior pitcher Jesse Meaux said. “Every conference game is a fight to the death.”</p>\n<p><strong>THE SQUAD</strong></p>\n<p>Teams usually have team captains. This year, the UCSB baseball team does not.</p>\n<p>“Everyone needs to lead,” Brontsema said. “It’s not a situation where you got to follow the leader. It’s a situation where everyone needs to do the right things.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns a number of players from last year’s team. Seniors such as Mark Haddow will provide experience for newcomers to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Haddow is a guy that has taken the lead as much as anybody,” Brontsema said. “We’re asking everybody to be a leader, everybody to do things right.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has 16 seniors on its active roster, as well as 12 freshmen. Only nine players are either sophomores or juniors.</p>\n<p>“Freshmen have stepped up and done a great job,” Whyte said. “They are doing everything they can do to learn from the upperclassmen.”</p>\n<p>While the team’s starting lineup is anchored by older players, three freshmen — pitcher Cameron Cuneo, infielder Joe Woodward and catcher Joe Winterburn — highlight a strong class of first-year players. While Cuneo was the only freshman to see playing time against Westmont, Winterburn made his collegiate debut in the home opener against La Salle, and will continue to catch during the team’s upcoming series in Washington.</p>\n<p>“[Winterburn] is a very polished and poised guy,” Brontsema said. “There’s nothing that he’s shown us so far that tells us he doesn’t deserve more [playing] time.”</p>\n<p>UCSB lost arguably one of its best players to the MLB when Mario Hollands was drafted during the offseason. Seniors Loredo and Meaux will fill this year’s pitching rotation. Meaux, given All-Big West Conference honorable-mention accolades last year, was a late-round draft pick by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2010, but chose to return to UCSB and play his final season. Joining Loredo and Meaux on the mound will be senior Greg Davis, who finished second on the team for most strikeouts last year.</p>\n<p>“[We] have guys returning who are going to be better, and that should make us better,” Brontsema said. “Guys like that can help fill the void of losing a guy like Mario.”</p>\n<p>Haddow supports the team’s defense from right field, and will be a major contribution to UCSB’s offensive output as well. As a junior last season, Haddow was tied in leading the team with 17 stolen bases with an on-base percentage of .373.</p>\n<p>Whyte, who led the team in multiple offensive categories last season and hit five home runs with a .304 batting average, will start at first base. Sophomore Steven Moon fills the shortstop spot left vacant by Valaika. He made six starts during the 2010 season as a freshman.</p>\n<p>“We have depth — we have a lot of really good guys,” Meaux said.  “There’s a lot of seniors and a lot of experience, and the freshmen are a bunch of good ballplayers.”</p>\n<p><strong>A NEW BEGINNING</strong></p>\n<p>Last year’s battles within the Big West ended poorly for UCSB, as the team finished the season at 10-14, tied with rival Cal Poly for fifth place. This year’s squad plans on using the underachieving effort of 2010 as encouragement for its conference games as the season continues through spring.</p>\n<p>“We have a huge motivation to do what we failed to do last year,” Whyte said. “Last year we focused too much on the following series or who we were playing in months to come. It’s all about taking it one pitch at a time [this year].”</p>\n<p>Extra effort began during fall practices, where the team would routinely meet during the week for mandatory and optional conditioning sessions and workouts. The training regimen has continued through Winter Quarter, and UCSB hopes that the work ethic will prove its worth in game-situations.</p>\n<p>“We’re all in very good shape for the long run,” Palermo said. “We have a lot of guys that want to work extra hours at night or work out on a day off. It’s going to play a huge role during season.”</p>\n<p>The team hopes that its losing effort shown last year will fuel a mentality that many Gaucho players share.</p>\n<p>“Everybody’s real serious about their business,” Meaux said. “We’re all working toward the same goal, which is making it to regionals then making it to Omaha.”</p>\n<p>Omaha, Nebraska has been the annual home of the College World Series since 1950. Because the Big West is so strong — ranked by rivals.com as the sixth-best conference in the nation — UCSB does not necessarily have to win the league title in order to continue playing in the postseason. However, success in the team’s difficult preseason schedule will help the Gauchos reach its goal of a postseason berth.</p>\n<p>“Last year we focused too much on the following series, or who we were playing in the coming months instead of focusing on the current task,” Whyte said. “This year we’re focusing on the now.”</p>\n<p>“The now” will continue during the coming weeks, as UCSB faces several opponents before Big West play begins against Cal Poly on April 8. However, before league games begin, UCSB will continue to use its newfound work ethic and positive team unity to try and capitalize on a new season.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about staying as positive as you can,” Whyte said. “There’s nothing you can control. The past is the past.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/season-preview-team-high-hopes-disappointing-2010/","id":4562,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4561,4560,4559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Briefs: Baseball, Men’s and Women’s Water Polo","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Baseball: Haddow Named Big West Player of the Week \r\n\r\nAfter driving in six runs in two wins, senior right fielder Mark Haddow earned Big West Player of the Week honors after going 6-16 with two doubl...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Baseball: Haddow Named Big West Player of the Week </strong></p>\n<p>After driving in six runs in two wins, senior right fielder Mark Haddow earned Big West Player of the Week honors after going 6-16 with two doubles and a home run last week.

Sac State has played six of its nine total games at home, and has only beaten UC Davis on the road during its first game of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Senior right-hander Jesse Meaux will be starting on the mound for the Gauchos during the first game of the series on Friday. Meaux made his season debut against Washington State amidst harsh weather and cold temperatures last weekend, pitching 7.1 innings against the Cougars, allowing eight hits and five earned runs. He struck out two batters.</p>\n<p>“He gave us a great outing at Washington in tough conditions,” Brontsema said. “I’m sure Jesse will be happy to be pitching where he can feel his fingers.”</p>\n<p>The overall series between these two teams is currently 25-21-2 in favor of the Gauchos. UCSB’s last series win came in 2004, when it swept Sac State in three games. Sac State won last year’s series 2-3 in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>“Their [pitchers] in the past like to throw a lot of sliders,” senior outfielder Ben Edelstein said. “We’ve worked on hitting the breaking ball and having a good approach at the plate.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s most recent game ended in a 9-6 loss at Pepperdine on Tuesday. The Gauchos held the lead throughout the majority of the game, until a scoring streak by Pepperdine in the eighth inning put the Waves ahead. With two outs in the bottom of the eighth, Pepperdine scored five runs in a row to reclaim the lead.</p>\n<p>Many Gaucho players have attributed errors and poor defense to the loss against Pepperdine. Practices have been formulated to focus on fixing these mistakes in order to avoid them during the series against Sac State.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been taking more repetitions in practice,” senior left-hander Nick Capito said. “More ground balls and fly balls … mentally we know we can make those plays.”</p>\n<p>After having three games cancelled this season due to poor weather conditions, UCSB has played the least amount of games of any team in the Big West Conference. With league play quickly approaching, Brontsema knows how important it is to gain experience from each game.</p>\n<p>“We have a little bit of a disadvantage,” Brontsema said. “The more games you have, the more of an identity you develop as a team. It takes us out of any kind of rhythm to not have played games more consistently.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will try to play more consistently this weekend during the series against Sac State. The first of the three games will be played at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium today at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34574\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-03/gauchos-aim-losing-streak-hornets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34574\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-03/gauchos-aim-losing-streak-hornets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-03/gauchos-aim-losing-streak-hornets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-03/gauchos-aim-losing-streak-hornets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-03/gauchos-aim-losing-streak-hornets/","id":4564,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4563,4562,4561],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
