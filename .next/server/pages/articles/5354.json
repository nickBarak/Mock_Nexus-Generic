On Tuesday afternoon, Head Coach Kathy Gregory officially announced in a press conference full of supportive and adoring players, coaches, alumni and faculty that after 38 years, she was moving on.</p>\n<p>“I really did not think I would be coaching for 38 years,” Gregory said. “I look at myself and say how blessed and lucky I am to be able to do something that doesn’t kill you, doesn’t make you hate it or want to walk away. I am the lucky one. Everyone sitting here today realize that I have something special.”</p>\n<p>Gregory leaves behind a large and lasting legacy. She compiled 882 wins, the fifth most in NCAA Division I history. Under her guidance, the Gauchos went on to 27 NCAA Tournaments and, along with only three other schools, advanced to the first 26. Gregory also took her team to the NCAA Elite Eight three times and to the Sweet Sixteen two more times. She was honored as the AVCA National Coach of the Year in 1993, was a four-time AVCA West Region Coach of the Year and a seven-time Big West Conference Coach of the Year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To Gregory, what was even more important than winning was the success and growth of her players.</p>\n<p>“The most important part of this job that I want people to realize is the students and the fact that you have to impact their lives,” Gregory said. “I am not the easiest coach, I’ll be the first to say it, but life is not easy. Life is very demanding. The challenges that all of us have faced and are going to face is what real competitors are about.”</p>\n<p>Current and past players spoke about the honor it was to play under the direction of Gregory and what it meant to be a student of her game.</p>\n<p>“It means the world to me to be a part of this with Kathy, because she has done everything for me and I will owe her everything the rest of my life and try and repay her with what she has taught me throughout the four years I played at Santa Barbara,” former player Dana Vargas said. “I would not be the young woman that I am today without Kathy. Kathy always shows you the big picture and things to concentrate on, and I am so thankful.”</p>\n<p>Speaking on behalf of the current women’s volleyball team was junior middle blocker Jenna Wilson.</p>\n<p>“I can say you’re the toughest coach I have ever had by far, and anyone who has played for her knows that,” Wilson said. “But I am so grateful. I wouldn’t have it any other way because you have taught us so much about life, not just volleyball, and helped us to grow so much. At the same time, there was never a dull moment with you.”</p>\n<p>Gregory’s infamous energy could not be calmed even on her final day. Throughout the conference she had been lively and enjoyed her time. It had been quite clear this was not a sad moment, but as she came to the end of her address, she let all in attendance know exactly how exciting it was to be around her, much to the amusement to the audience.</p>\n<p>“Everyone asks you ‘How do you want to be remembered?’ Alright, I want to tell you how I want to be remembered. Number one, I want to be remembered for commitment and always giving 100 percent of myself to this job and this program for 38 years. Two, 100 percent graduation rate of any woman that played for me for four years. Three, I lived my life filled with gratitude and appreciation for all the opportunities that I have had in my life and I have tried to instill that attitude into my players. And four, I walked away with the same competitive fire and energy that I had when I started this in 1975.”</p>\n<p>Gregory may be stepping down as head coach, but she may be moving to other endeavors on campus.</p>\n<p>“It is not the end for Kathy. We are going to ask her to look at the possibility of us starting a beach volleyball program.” UCSB Athletics Director Mark Massari said. “The NCAA announced that as an emerging sport recently. I have held off on that a little bit. Kathy has wanted to push for that. I have held off to be sure we are in it to win it. I know we are now, so she is going to start that with us.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/","id":5354,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5353,5352,5351],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Place Fifth in UCSB Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite last year’s disappointing finish to the season, hopes are running high for the No. 13 UCSB men’s volleyball team after a positive performance at the UCSB Asics Invitational.

UCSB took the first set of the match thanks in large part to sophomore opposite Matt Marsh’s efficient offense, who totaled eight kills with a hitting percentage of .636 in the first set.</p>\n<p>Defense was also a key component for the Gauchos as they limited Loyola to just a .084 hitting percentage over the course of the game and compiled 12.5 blocks, compared to just 5.5 for the Ramblers.</p>\n<p>“Defense was a huge factor in that game,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “We knew what to expect from that team; we were able to recognize what they were going to do almost before they did it so it was easier to play defense. It was easier to block against them.”</p>\n<p>The win over Loyola came a day after the Gauchos split their opening games of the tournament, sweeping Lewis in three sets and losing a close five-set contest to the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Davis was big in the second game versus the Flyers as he had seven kills in the match with six block assists. UCSB ended the first set 25-15 and Davis had three straight aces in the second set to give the Gauchos a 2-0 advantage. With the score at 22-19, UCSB held off the Flyers and closed out the final set with three straight points to win 25-19.</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, the Gauchos seemed ready to sweep UCLA after taking the first two sets. In a back-and-forth first set, Evans gave the Gauchos the set with his fourth kill of the game to win 27-25.
