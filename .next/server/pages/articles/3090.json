The event also featured renowned public figures, such as journalist Stephen Colbert and economist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus. Over 1,000 students attended the conference, with UCSB students Olivia Wong, Alexander Scarlett and Jack John Amend attending the conference as representatives of nonprofit organization Inspire a Child — which was recently awarded the $10,000 Strauss Grant and officially supported by Chancellor Henry T. Yang.<br>\nWong, founder and executive director of Inspire a Child, said she has attended the conference once before and finds much inspiration and knowledge in participating in it. She said the involvement of fellow university students makes the event capable of producing real public policy action regarding prominent global issues.<br>\n“The most exciting thing [about CGIU] is that I am constantly pushed by my peers, challenged by their resolve and motivated to pursue my solution to the world’s greatest problems,” Wong said. “CGIU is not just a place to talk about ideas. It’s about turning an idea into action — taking that concrete step towards solving world hunger and ending poverty.”<br>\nThe conference included three sessions that targeted the main issues of discussion. One session — entitled “Getting off the Ground: Stories of Starting Up” — featured a panel of upcoming entrepreneurs, who shared their knowledge and experience in launching their own businesses. The second session, called “A Better Future for Girls and Women: Empowering the Next Generation,” welcomed professionals and other figures to discuss the many ways today’s youth can make the necessary changes and decisions to give a brighter future to girls and women worldwide. The last session, called “Solutions Without Borders: Working with Unlikely Allies,” brought together legislators and entrepreneurs to discuss the need for international cooperation.<br>\nAmend said Inspire a Child’s focus on helping youth is beneficial to the overall international community because the welfare of the world’s youth can greatly influence the welfare of the world as a whole.<br>\n“The international community knows full well that a driving force to the end of poverty is universal education, especially towards the younger generations as well as the promotion of women and girls rights,” Amend said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/","id":3090,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3089,3088,3087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Candidates represented either the Democratic Process Party (DP) or the Open Peoples Party (OPP), and were each allowed a short amount of time to speak.</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding sexual violence on campus, OPP candidate Andre Theus said, if elected, he would unite the student body with various organizations on campus that address sexual assault issues.</p>\n<p>“Every day there are campus organizations that are working on this issue, but we need to once again unite and create a culture where UCSB is intolerant of sexual violence,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>DP Candidate Anisha Ahuja also said she would strive to allocate more funding for Take Back the Night and other similar committees in addition to prompting the university to address problematic web pages.</p>\n<p>“We also need to take a stand against things like UCSB Confessions and UCSB Hook-Ups that perpetuate the rape culture, and continue to educate people about things like consent and rape culture that are existent in our community,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>When the forum proctor asked candidates their opinion on funding for Greek life, DP Candidate Hani Tajsar said that the Greek community should be required to go through certain training before receiving school funding.</p>\n<p>“One goal that I would fulfill … is to require if Greek life is going to want to get funding from Associated Students that they go through safe-zone training,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Corey Lau followed by saying that he did not think funding for Greek life should necessarily be a top priority for A.S.</p>\n<p>“[Funding for Greek life] isn’t always something that should be necessarily pushed for,” Lau said. “We do have other issues on campus.”</p>\n<p>Later in the questioning, candidates were asked about the ways they would promote a healthier environment during large-scale events such as Deltopia and Halloween.</p>\n<p>DP’s Mario Vasquez said a major problem with big Isla Vista events has to do with inaccessibility to large portions of the student body.</p>\n<p>“It’s a travesty that these events aren’t for everyone, they’re not for all students,” Vasquez said. “It’s a travesty that I have homosexual friends, the queer community, that don’t feel safe walking around in pride festival shirts and are susceptible to hate crimes.”</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Jake Speyer said the school should continue supporting these events but place a larger emphasis on student safety.</p>\n<p>“I feel that we should start by saying that Deltopia and Halloween are traditions that UCSB holds and that we should absolutely not get rid of them,” Speyer said. “But with these traditions comes some things that we need to improve, such as infrastructure, education and awareness and community engagement.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the forum, candidates were asked to explain why they chose to run with their respective party. According to OPP candidates, their party policy — creating a new platform with every new group of candidates — allows for more original ideas and innovation. Several DP candidates said current DP senators have been more involved in the groups they were part of.</p>\n<p>Members from both parties emphasized their interest in diversity, each side arguing that their party represented every single UCSB student.</p>\n<p>Forums and debates will continue this week and the next. Still to come are the Presidential and Executive Officer debates, as well as the On-Campus Senator forum. Voting begins April 22 on GOLD.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 10th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50768\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50768\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/","id":3087,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3086,3085,3084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Holds Student-Run Textbook Trade","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Haley Kulik Staff Writer   Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board will host a Textbook Marketplace this afternoon in Storke Plaza from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m., in w...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Haley Kulik</p>\n<p>Staff Writer</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board will host a Textbook Marketplace this afternoon in Storke Plaza from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m., in which students can buy and sell their used textbooks in order to circumvent low buyback offers and high prices.</p>\n<p>The event will be divided into sections for each department and the direct trade will allow students to regulate the prices of their books rather than accept prices set by buyback companies or bookstores.</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, a third-year chemistry and biopsychology major and the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the Associated Students Office of the President, said the organization was inspired to host the event again after the success of last quarter’s marketplace.</p>\n<p>“We started this last quarter, but it actually used to be a common occurrence where students would just do this as part of the culture,” Lakhani said. “And we want to get that started again.”</p>\n<p>Last quarter’s marketplace offered students upwards of 10 times more money than corporate buyback companies would for used textbooks, according to Armen.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter was a great success, it was incredible to see students get $50 or $80 for a book they would get only $5 for at the corporate buy back tents, which really rip students off,” Armen said. “Tuition and book prices are outrageously expensive here — this is what student power looks like, not only advocacy but solutions — so we are hitting the problem on all fronts. We hope to truly institutionalize this so it happens every quarter and expect it to grow and grow.”</p>\n<p>Organizers will be holding students’ books for them, and will be responsible for overseeing the exchanges up to the close of the market. Student book-sellers will have to leave a slip of paper identifying which books belong to them, Lakhani said.</p>\n<p>According to Lakhani, students do not have to be present for the whole event in order to take advantage of the opportunity to buy and sell books.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t want to stick around for too long and you’re a seller, you can leave your contact info so people can contact you,” Lakhani said. “And if you’re a buyer you can leave a wish list so if a seller comes back later he or she can contact you then.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Office of the President is hoping to encourage trade between students, as this event will reduce the amount of money that students pay for textbooks. Lakhani said that A.S. will not be dealing with students’ money whatsoever since A.S. is simply putting on the event to provide a safe environment for students to exchange textbooks with each other.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just a common time and place for students to do this safely. We are not handling any money or even doing any trades for anybody. They’re dealing directly with other students,” said Lakhani.</p>\n<p>Arda Jooharian contributed to this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/","id":3088,"author":{"id":199,"name":"Haley Kulik"},"related":[3087,3086,3085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Resolution Conversation Continues To Dominate Senate Meetings","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-Divestment-JohnClow-04.10.2013-06.jpg?resize=355%2C226&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-Divestment-JohnClow-04.10.2013-06.jpg?resize=400%2C226&ssl=1","description":"Last night’s Associated Students Senate meeting — which was once again held in Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of students in attendance — centered around lengthy discussion of the u...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last night’s Associated Students Senate meeting — which was once again held in Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of students in attendance — centered around lengthy discussion of the university’s potential divestment from companies that allegedly support apartheid and violate human rights.<br>\nDuring the forum, students expressed their reasoning for supporting or opposing divestment — an issue that was first introduced at last week’s meeting, resulting in nine hours of heated debate. Academic Affairs Board External Co-Chair Adeel Lakhani said the senate’s responsibility is to actively and critically analyze all perspectives when considering whether or not to pass the resolution, entitled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid.”<br>\n“Active pursuit of understanding is different from being served arguments or ideology,” Lakhani said. “My main point was that consideration of this resolution should be limited to consideration of this resolution … this resolution does not address how to finally address all parties’ concerns but this resolution does make clear that all parties’ concerns should be respected.”<br>\nStudent Rosina Saeed, a supporter of divestment, said discrimination plays a large role in human rights violations occurring in Palestine.<br>\n“I would like to address apartheid,” Saeed said. “My definition of apartheid is racial segregation, simple as that.”<br>\nIn contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace member Rand Clark said support for divestment and anti-Semitism are mutually exclusive sentiments.<br>\n“A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude toward Jews,” Clark said. “A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”<br>\nRabbi Evan Goodman said the resolution has prompted strong reactions from students who feel personally attacked by the university’s potential divestment.<br>\n“One student I spoke to today, I spent a good hour trying to talk him out of withdrawing from the university,” Goodman said.<br>\nAccording to Meggie Le, A.S. President at UCSD, the resolution has been particularly controversial due to the complex and challenging nature of the conflict.<br>\n“Political issues will always be divisive in their nature, but this one is unique in that it is also alienating,” Le said.<br>\nDue to printing constraints, the full story could not be included in today’s issue.
