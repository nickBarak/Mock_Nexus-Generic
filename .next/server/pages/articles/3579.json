Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was vital, as the UC would have a $30 million hole in its funding without the hike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we are recommending… is a modest increase in non-resident student tuition, 2.6 percent. It’s basically a cost-of-living adjustment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our primary purpose is to educate the next generation of Californians.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA) has been the loudest voice against the tuition hike. UCSA President Caroline Siegel-Singh delivered a letter to state legislators on March 6, opposing both a non-resident student cap and the tuition hike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we discuss the importance of an affordable UC education, we cannot neglect that non-residents contribute a total of $120 million towards need-based financial aid through the UC grant and therefore support approximately 100,000 California residents,” the letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing first proposed not voting on the issue, saying that she “came in with one point of view” and now felt conflicted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there is so much more work to do on this. I think that we should hold off on this if possible and really talk to the legislature and really look at possible scholarships and how we handle this situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadi Makarechian, chair of the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, presented a recommendation from the committee to move forward with the $762 tuition increase, but said that there was opposition to the increase within the committee, including from himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Regents voiced their concerns about the tuition hike, saying it would make the UC less of a “world-class institution” and accessible only to the very wealthy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen also pointed out that the increase would affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students who might be California residents but do not qualify for in-state tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When [students] get on campus, for me they’re all California students, and we have sort of a moral obligation to treat them the same way we would all of our other students,” he said about out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent John A. Pérez said that until the Regents “reopen the discussion about pathways for financial aid for out-of-state students,” he could not support the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez also recommended “admission group cohort increases,” which would mean that when accepted, students would pay the listed rate at the time for the four years they attend a UC. Any tuition increases voted on when they are in school would not affect students currently enrolled, keeping tuition the same for a class of students when they first enter school up until they graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Regents plans to reconsider the tuition hike at their next meeting in May, which will be held at UC San Francisco. In the meantime, they will explore other avenues to resolve the $30 million budget hole, they decided at today’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option they are looking to is asking the state legislature for money to sustain the programs that would be cut without the hike, as Napolitano noted that the state would not provide funds for out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also intend to look for a way to differentiate DACA students from out-of-state and international students and develop a way to provide financial assistance for out-of-state students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Ph.D. student who wrote her dissertation on the celebrations, Halloween weekend is remarkable.</p>\n<p>“It’s an eventless event, and everything is done on the fly. It has a magical feel to it, like anything could happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>For others, such as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, the affair is something else entirely.</p>\n<p>“I hate Halloween. Not so much the holiday or that people want to go out and have a good time. But I hate that thousands — or tens of thousands — of outsiders trash our community and houses and stress our emergency resources and then leave with us to deal with the debris,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Wondering how to handle your Halloween? Read on to make your holiday weekend the best it can be.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ray Vuillemainroy, there will be 150 deputies and officers on patrol in Isla Vista in addition to 10 mounted police units.</p>\n<p>“The patrol will have mostly uniformed deputies, many of which are specially trained in crowd control,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, Vuillemainroy also noted that there will be “plain-clothed” cops on patrol.</p>\n<p>Vuillemainroy said students only have to act sensibly to stay out of trouble.</p>\n<p>“Be responsible. Have respect for others and, obviously, don’t indulge too much in alcohol. Basically, be responsible,” he said. “Everyone knows right from wrong.”</p>\n<p>“The main [policies] are still in place, that being the zero tolerance and the noise ordinance,” Young said.</p>\n<p>The festival ordinance, which has been in effect for 17 years, will be enforced from now until Thursday, Nov. 4. From 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. on the indicated days, no live or recorded music is permitted at a volume that can be heard from the street.</p>\n<p>Noise and festival ordinance violation fines range from $144 to $500, and any unpaid amounts will appear on your credit report.</p>\n<p>There are a slew of other laws that the IVFP will enforce. If minors are furnished with alcohol, the penalty is $1000 if the minor is aged 18 to 20, and $3000 if the minor is under 18 years of age. This fine is multiplied by the number of minors attending a party.</p>\n<p>Possession of an open container will cost you $102 to $500, and Minor in Possession penalties are $500 and a one year driver’s license suspension. If you’re caught drunk in public, you’ll pay anywhere from $525 to $1000, and public urination has a $270 standard fine upon first conviction.</p>\n<p>If you plan on having any out-of-town friends visit, check your lease first. Many landlords include a Halloween clause that bans overnight guests, alcohol or parties during the holiday weekend.</p>\n<p>Although the Social Host Ordinance is already in effect in Santa Barbara County, Vuillemainroy said the IVFP will not enforce it until December.</p>\n<p>“We were concerned about the crowding. If you were someone who lived on DP or Sabado Tarde and wanted to get to your apartment, good luck,” Michelle Morgante, UCSB alumna and former Daily Nexus news editor, said of the Halloween in the late ’80s.</p>\n<p>Not much has changed since then. However, in recent years limits have been instated to prevent some of Halloween’s past problems with street overcrowding and illegal parking.</p>\n<p>All cars on the 6500-6700 blocks of Del Playa must be off the street by 3 p.m. on Friday and can return at 6 a.m. on Monday. A number of entrance points to Del Playa, Sabado Tarde and Trigo Roads will be blocked to all incoming traffic for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Campus parking permits for Halloween, which also act as a Night &amp; Weekend Pass for the rest of Fall Quarter, are available online for $17.50 plus a $5.95 shipping cost.</p>\n<p>Every year, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is overwhelmed by the volume of alcohol-related accidents.</p>\n<p>“We’re overrunning the hospitals. The emergency rooms can’t handle the alcohol poisonings and other cases that come about [every year],” Young said.</p>\n<p>Alcohol poisoning signs include the inability to wake up, vomiting while passed out, slow or irregular breathing, extreme confusion and pale skin.</p>\n<p>If a friend is displaying these signs, call 9-1-1. Do not let the person fall asleep and do not induce vomiting. Turn the person on their side to prevent choking should they vomit and stay calm until authorities arrive.</p>\n<p>Even if a person does not die from alcohol poisoning, they can suffer irreversible brain damage.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Web site recommends that students “eat a good dinner and continue to snack throughout the night, alternate one alcoholic drink with one non-alcoholic drink and avoid drinking games or shots” as a way to drink safely and avoid a hangover.</p>\n<p>If you do wake up with a hangover, it is important to eat a healthy meal as soon as you can, drink plenty of water or juice and avoid excessive amounts of caffeine. Rehydrating and nourishing your body will get you back on track.</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, major events coordinator for A.S., said keeping drinking under control prevents reckless behavior that could get you arrested.</p>\n<p>“People do crazy things while under the influence,” he said.</p>\n<p>For decades, Halloween has seen an elevated number of sexual harassment cases.</p>\n<p>“There would be blocks where you would get grabbed, absolutely, if you were a woman…it was completely person-to-person, elbow-to-elbow,” Morgante said.</p>\n<p>Danielle Mayorga, co-chair for Take Back the Night and fourth-year communication and linguistics major, said her group is working to prevent sexual violence on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“There’s a huge trend around Halloween where there’s a high number of sexual harassments but also sexual assault,” she said. “Things that I’ve seen on the streets on Halloween are people grabbing other’s asses or, if there’s a scantily clad person, people will grab them or make comments at them. Both are examples of sexual harassment and assault.”</p>\n<p>Any physical contact or sexual act without a clear, consensual “yes” constitutes sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“People have the right to wear whatever they want, however little they want, and it is not an invitation for people to grab them, harass them or rape them,” Mayorga said.</p>\n<p>Mayorga recommended that any rape victims call the 24-Hour Rape Crisis Hotline at (805) 564-3696 for guidance immediately following an attack. She also noted that the UCSB Women’s Center provides free and confidential counseling for both sexual assault survivors and friends of the victims.</p>\n<p>Although there are a number of police and paramedic stations located around I.V. for the weekend, Mayorga said that contacting authorities is, ultimately, the victim’s decision.</p>\n<p>“There’s a very large trend of survivors choosing not to report, due to a number of different reasons,” she said. “…They experience a loss of power, [and] being able to restore that by choosing whether you want to see a police officer or talk to a counselor is the survivor’s choice.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz and A.S. coordinators are throwing a Halloween Film Festival at People’s Park in Isla Vista. The event will last throughout Saturday evening and will alternate between showing “Beetlejuice” and “The Ring” from 8:00 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, the gathering will include free water, coffee, snacks and condoms in addition to access to restrooms.</p>\n<p>“I hope people come to watch movies, but I want them to know that there is a place for them if they need to sit down, use the bathroom or get water,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lantz said she estimates that 200 to 300 people will attend over the course of the eight hour event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an Adopt-A-Block group will clean-up the streets from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. Volunteers will meet at the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District office to pick up supplies. The program provides participants with lunch and a free t-shirt.\t\tThe county and university has asked students not to invite out-of-town friends to the event since 1993.</p>\n<p>Statistically, non residents are the perpetrators of most assaults and accidents.</p>\n<p>“When you have so many people come in from out of town, it changes the character of the celebration,” 3rd District Supervisor Farr said. “Statistically, the predominate number of arrests are of people who are from out of town.”</p>\n<p>IVFP and Office of Student Life statistics show that approximately 97.1 percent of the arrested and cited individuals last year were from out-of-town.</p>\n<p>According to Young, out-of-towners pose one of the biggest issues for Halloween regulation.</p>\n<p>“Hundreds, thousands, — maybe tens of thousands of strangers — are getting trashed, destroying our community, creating a big mess in the name of having a good time. And then they leave,” Young said. “That’s the problem.”</p>\n<p>Every year, the state and county spend upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars on policing, paramedics, hospital emergencies and other costs.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of police and dozens, if not hundreds of emergency personnel. This is all happening because of people who decide to come here and do that to us. As a citizen of this community, it frankly pisses me off that these people feel like they can come here, trash it and then leave me with the bill,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Yonie Harris, UCSB Dean of Students, said money could easily be conserved if the Halloween celebrations are limited to locals only.</p>\n<p>“What really upsets me and has always upset me is the waste of tax dollars — in a time like now when the state, county, and university are in a financial crisis, it is quite unfortunate that we have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on public safety, clean up, transportation, medical support, etc. for a big party that centers around drinking,” she said in an e-mail.  “I can think of so many other things that those resources could be used for.”</p>\n<p>MacIan said that, ultimately, it is the students’ responsibility to keep Halloween safe and fun.</p>\n<p>“For people in I.V., if you want [Halloween] to be good, then make it good. There’s nobody else there to make it good for you,” she said. “You can’t expect it to be Disneyland, because it’s not fucking Disneyland.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

local event, strictly local,’” now-former Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ken Shemwell said of Halloween in Isla Vista in a 1992 Daily Nexus article. “‘[In the late 80’s] though, people from out of town came to party and trash the town, they didn’t really care. They were going to be here for one or two days and go home.’”</p>\n<p>According to a 1993 Santa Barbara County Action Plan Report, people from Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and all over California flocked to the area for the weekend-long celebration. Over 70 out-of-town schools were represented among the arrested and cited students.</p>\n<p>‘For young people in the age group of 14-26 years, Isla Vista has become ‘the place to be’ on Halloween,” the report said.</p>\n<p><strong>“Big, Destructive and Dangerous”</strong></p>\n<p>The early 90’s saw a huge increase of Halloween attendees, accidents and arrests.</p>\n<p>Michael Young, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, said he had heard rumors of the wild revelry when he started working at UCSB in 1990.</p>\n<p>“Halloween celebrations had gotten way too big, destructive and dangerous,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life administrative files, 853 of 25,000 attendees were arrested in 1991. Of the offenders, 80 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>That same year, two people fell off the cliffs and two deputies were injured while on duty.</p>\n<p>Despite growing concern from the community, Halloween of 1992 fell on a Saturday and no serious moves were made by the county or university to stop the event.</p>\n<p>That year also had the second most arrests and citations in Halloween history — 1,090 out of 40,000 attendees, 95 percent of which were for alcohol violations. Again, two people fell off the cliffs, including a teenager who fell 65 feet from the 6600 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara Sherriff Summary Reports, Halloween 1992 cost the county approximately $100,000 in law enforcement overtime alone.</p>\n<p>“It was a particularly bad Halloween that year [1992] and a decision was made, and made by the county, that they needed to, if not put an end to it, then certainly bring it down to more acceptable levels,” Young said.</p>\n<p><strong>What Caused The Change? The Infamous Playboy Article… That Wasn’t</strong></p>\n<p>A letter from Sherriff Jim Thomas to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors in September 1993 explained why he thought the party boomed.</p>\n<p>“In the mid 1980’s, the news media descended on Halloween in Isla Vista and made it into a nationwide media event. Major television newscasters and publications such as Playboy magazine did extensive coverage of the ‘party,’” the letter said. “Halloween evolved from a local holiday spirit event to the largest college party in California.”</p>\n<p>A number of Daily Nexus articles in addition to reports in the La Cumbre yearbook and The Santa Barbara News-Press also attributed the spike in attendance to a mid-80s Playboy article that listed Isla Vista as a top spot to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>While researching for her 2006 dissertation on Halloween in I.V., then-UCSB Ph.D. student Adrienne MacIan said she encountered a number of interviewees who noted that the infamous magazine was instrumental in the weekend’s infamy.</p>\n<p>“Everyone told me, ‘Things got really out of control after that Playboy article,’” MacIan said.</p>\n<p>In a Daily Nexus poll issued last week, 52 percent said they thought Halloween in IV became a renowned event “In the late 80’s after Playboy ran an article on the event.”</p>\n<p>In actuality, the article is nothing more than an urban myth. There is no evidence of its existence in any Playboy magazine from 1985 through 1992.</p>\n<p>MacIan said all of the individuals who claimed they had seen the story later admitted they had, in fact, only seen a Xeroxed copy of a list. None had seen the actual article in the magazine.</p>\n<p>According to MacIan, a student most likely perpetrated the rumor as a practical joke.</p>\n<p>“There was a whole urban legend built up around this thing that nobody ever bothered to check,” MacIan said.</p>\n<p><strong>The Five Year Plan</strong></p>\n<p>“We, at times, had busloads of people from other campus come here, get trashed, trash the place…and then leave,” Young said. “…What I felt, and what certainly many people in the leadership community felt, was that we should not encourage people to be here and we should warn people that the county had made a set of judgments that it was no longer going to tolerate certain kinds of behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Grand Jury issued an investigation and, subsequently, recommended that the Board of Supervisors take action to halt the event.</p>\n<p>“…Many county government officials recognized that the Halloween ‘college party’ in Isla Vista was no longer an event that can be sanctioned, condoned, chaperoned or tolerated by this County,” a 1993 County Action Summary Report said.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement drafted the “Five Year Plan” to limit the number of revelers that flocked to I.V. the next Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The procedure included a “no tolerance policy” in addition to a festival ordinance that forbade outdoor music from 6 p.m. onward during the weekend, the confiscation of any costume prop that could be used as a weapon, barricading five main entrances into Isla Vista, restricting parking on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde from Oct. 29 until Nov. 1 and implementing pre-Halloween regulations as early as the first week of September.</p>\n<p>“Arrests were up, citations were down and Isla Vistans agreed it was a very different Halloween experience from years past…” Brett Chapman wrote in a 1993 Daily Nexus article. “Operational changes for 1993 included making custody arrests whenever possible, exacting higher fines for infractions and strictly enforcing a ban on live and amplified prerecorded music.”</p>\n<p>Whether increased police presence or the fact that Halloween fell on a Sunday was more influential, the weekend saw only approximately 25,000 partiers. According to Office of Student Life files, 966 arrests were made, of which 93 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>Some students reacted against the new regulations and there were rumors that an abandoned apartment complex on Del Playa would be the target of arson on Halloween weekend. However, overall, reports noted that “officers observed a compliance to the laws and ordinances that were being enforced.”</p>\n<p>From 1993 onward, the numbers of attendees decreased and stayed low for almost a decade. In 1995, only 1,750 joined in the notorious street party, and both the administration and county officials started to think that the final nail was in the coffin for Halloween altogether.</p>\n<p>“I think it actually had an effect for a couple of years,” Young said. “But then the activity and the numbers began to creep up again.”</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”163″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"298412871\" data-slb-group=\"28206\"><img data-attachment-id=\"28208\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/cop_gives_ticketjs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=2175%2C3316&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2175,3316\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS-163x250.jpg?resize=163%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" width=\"163\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-28208\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span><strong>Halloween On The Rise</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly 10 years after the “Five Year Plan” was first implemented, 40,000 flocked the streets to celebrate Halloween — the same number of people that were at the disastrous 1992 event that initially inspired the stricter enforcements.</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry Yang, the number of attendees varies greatly depending on what day Halloween falls on. Halloween 2003, for instance, fell on a Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween celebration in Isla Vista does change from year to year, partly in response to whether Halloween falls on a weekend,” Yang said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Young speculated that other factors may have a hand in Halloween’s resurrection.</p>\n<p>“Frankly, I think the internet and Facebook and the ability of people to communicate and for ideas to go viral and for whole communities of people to find out about something … it sort of catches on,” he said. “I think that there’s something to be said for modern social media. I think that the press also continues to dredge up things … up until recent years, people felt compelled to drive trucks up from Los Angeles to here to broadcast about Halloween. If the media makes noise about something, then people will to come and participate in it.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Life also “made some noise” about Halloween when it sent out a university-wide e-mail entitled, “The party is over.” The message, which included the line “There is NO party,” attempted to deter students from celebrating Halloween.</p>\n<p>However, Young admitted that perhaps the university’s anti-Halloween campaign might have, ironically, actually encouraged out-of-towners to join in the festivities.</p>\n<p>“As I think about it, some people could see [the university’s past involvement] as counterproductive,” Young said. “People want to come to something that you say they shouldn’t come to … But my sense is that these kinds of activities have grown all over the country … there’s something in our culture that, at this time, makes these kinds of events appealing for young people.”</p>\n<p>In 2004 the university took a new approach to controlling Halloween with the ‘Keep it Safe, Keep it Local” campaign. Instead of trying to deter students altogether, administrators encouraged students to celebrate Halloween without outsiders.</p>\n<p>Last year, IVFP records say that there were 25,000 Halloween attendees, a modest number for IV. However, 2009 did set a record with 1,013 arrests and citations — the third most arrests in Halloween history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was estimated in the Daily Nexus that Halloween 2009 was going to cost the county and sate approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>That year, stricter parking regulations and a no-visitor policy in the dormitories were enforced.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Maxim deemed IV one of the top places in the nation to celebrate Halloween — finally bringing the Playboy myth to fruition.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said, while running for her current position in 2008, she asked if she could walk along with members of the IVFP for Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to see it for myself,” she said. “…I actually thought that, despite the crowd, everything seemed to be handled as well as possible.”</p>\n<p>Aside from several incidents of students jumping off roofs, Farr said that there “seemed to be a good working relationship between the Foot Patrol and the students.”</p>\n<p>Despite encouragement from Associated Students, the university administration and the county to keep the event local, out-of-towners still flock to the 2.1 square mile beach town every year to wander the streets.</p>\n<p>“…Everyone knows that Santa Barbara is the ultimate party spot for Halloween,” Levi Burridge, a 19-year old Fairfield resident, said in the Daily Nexus. “…This place is where I know we can all get down and party it up with everyone in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT TOMORROW’S NEXUS FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2010</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/","id":3578,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3577,3576,3575],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
