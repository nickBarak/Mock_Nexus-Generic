Academic Affairs Board External Co-Chair Adeel Lakhani said the senate’s responsibility is to actively and critically analyze all perspectives when considering whether or not to pass the resolution, entitled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid.”<br>\n“Active pursuit of understanding is different from being served arguments or ideology,” Lakhani said. “My main point was that consideration of this resolution should be limited to consideration of this resolution … this resolution does not address how to finally address all parties’ concerns but this resolution does make clear that all parties’ concerns should be respected.”<br>\nStudent Rosina Saeed, a supporter of divestment, said discrimination plays a large role in human rights violations occurring in Palestine.<br>\n“I would like to address apartheid,” Saeed said. “My definition of apartheid is racial segregation, simple as that.”<br>\nIn contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace member Rand Clark said support for divestment and anti-Semitism are mutually exclusive sentiments.<br>\n“A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude toward Jews,” Clark said. “A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”<br>\nRabbi Evan Goodman said the resolution has prompted strong reactions from students who feel personally attacked by the university’s potential divestment.<br>\n“One student I spoke to today, I spent a good hour trying to talk him out of withdrawing from the university,” Goodman said.<br>\nAccording to Meggie Le, A.S. President at UCSD, the resolution has been particularly controversial due to the complex and challenging nature of the conflict.<br>\n“Political issues will always be divisive in their nature, but this one is unique in that it is also alienating,” Le said.<br>\nDue to printing constraints, the full story could not be included in today’s issue.

Organizations including UC Student Association, Cal State Student Association and the Student Senate for California Community Colleges were all in attendance at the event.</p>\n<p>The Nexus held a Q&amp;A with Associated Students President Sophia Armen, who attended the rally and lobbied legislators alongside other UCSB students.</p>\n<p>So specifically, what were the goals of the rally?</p>\n<p>“This event, specifically, was looking at actually the governor’s proposal for the budget, which essentially maintains the status quo of a sincerely underfunded University — which after years and years of severe cuts, has essentially made going to college unbelievably unaffordable and inaccessible for students.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the increased funding provided by Prop 30 — which passed in November — is a short-term and unsustainable solution to the University’s ongoing fiscal woes.</p>\n<p>“Even though there is a five percent increase to the operating budget of the UC [through] Prop 30, UCSA … essentially was saying that a Band-Aid solution like Prop 30 — which really just came from the people of California, not the politicians … is not enough, because the status quo of paying almost $15,000 per year to go to a public university, for many students — especially middle income students and working class students — is just impossible.”</p>\n<p>How do you think Prop 30 has changed the state-level conversation regarding the funding of public higher education?</p>\n<p>“What I think that’s really important is that we’re looking at a climate that is very different, in terms of student organizing … It was students who really made Prop 30 happen. UCSA, which is all of the UCs combined, registered over 51,000 people to vote and not only that, but our campus actually registered over 11,190 people to vote — the most in the entire nation…”</p>\n<p>The passage of Prop 30 relied on the activism of student groups at both the campus and statewide levels, according to Armen, who said state lawmakers are now more aware of the political impact of student voters.</p>\n<p>“We made Prop 30 happen, which, historically in California, is pretty difficult. So what we have now is, we have quite a lot of our representatives — our politicians up in Sacramento — really seeing the numbers that we brought out, and essentially seeing the importance of listening to a very large youth vote.”</p>\n<p>But while students may hold a stronger voice in Sacramento, the state’s public higher education system continues to be underfunded, leaving the majority of its financial burden on students.</p>\n<p>“The reality is the status quo is not acceptable. The status quo is unjust and there is a very specific campaign — on the part of not only the UC, but the state — of very real public divestment from our UC system, and then essentially a campaign of shifting the weight in the University of California of the burden of funding fully on the backs of students, which has never been a reality for public education in CA like it is right now … The importance of Prop 30, though, is this is not where we stop; this is actually where we begin because now is the time where we actually have very rare breathing room where, for the first time in my four years, we don’t have a fee increase up on the table. We can actually talk about not only freezing tuition, but actually rolling back the obscene tuition increases that have essentially not only been a campaign of the state, but of the Regents as well.”</p>\n<p>What kind of future do you see for Cal Grants?</p>\n<p>At the lobby conference, UCSA made efforts to improve funding for the Cal Grant B award.Armen said the student group co-sponsored AB 1365 — a piece of legislation authored by Phil Tang which seeks to increase these awards up to $1,550. According to Armen, Governor Jerry Brown decreased these awards to $1,473 in last year’s budget through a blue pencil veto.</p>\n<p>We know you’re fighting for accessibility and affordability, as well as more need-based aid. How do you plan to implement these goals? What were short-term and long-term goals for this rally?</p>\n<p>“The reality is essentially since 2001, there has been $900 million worth in cuts to the UC system, so what were calling on — in the state of California — is to actually provide the basic human right of education to its residents … This is not a crisis of funding, and I think that’s the most important thing to hit home. This is a crisis about priorities in the state of California. We actively, at UCSA, learned about where our money is going at the statewide level and it seems that we have an addiction of locking up the residents of California over educating them.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the distribution of state funds does not adequately reflect the needs of California residents and consequently, has left university students like herself with mounds of debt to deal with upon graduation.</p>\n<p>“I think the important thing to understand is how exactly we prioritize our society and what we prioritize in our society, especially when were hearing ever-more important discussions about the economy, about the job market — which for me, I am now entering with over $80,000 in debt, graduating in June.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the short-term goals of student lobbying, Armen said it is essential for students to combat state initiatives like Governor Brown’s proposed unit cap — which would not allow students to take over 275 units without additional charge — as well as his ongoing push for a UC online education program. Armen said online education has been continually been pushed by the governor’s agenda, despite its clear lack of popularity with students.</p>\n<p>“[With] this online education experiment — which…the UC Regents are being forced to invest tons of money into — we’re not seeing students overjoyed by taking online classes. As a matter of fact, the educational experience that you would receive is definitely disturbing for how much you’re paying. The reality is online education is really not a replacement of in-class instruction.”</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 5th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Jonathan D.

Candidates represented either the Democratic Process Party (DP) or the Open Peoples Party (OPP), and were each allowed a short amount of time to speak.</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding sexual violence on campus, OPP candidate Andre Theus said, if elected, he would unite the student body with various organizations on campus that address sexual assault issues.</p>\n<p>“Every day there are campus organizations that are working on this issue, but we need to once again unite and create a culture where UCSB is intolerant of sexual violence,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>DP Candidate Anisha Ahuja also said she would strive to allocate more funding for Take Back the Night and other similar committees in addition to prompting the university to address problematic web pages.</p>\n<p>“We also need to take a stand against things like UCSB Confessions and UCSB Hook-Ups that perpetuate the rape culture, and continue to educate people about things like consent and rape culture that are existent in our community,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>When the forum proctor asked candidates their opinion on funding for Greek life, DP Candidate Hani Tajsar said that the Greek community should be required to go through certain training before receiving school funding.</p>\n<p>“One goal that I would fulfill … is to require if Greek life is going to want to get funding from Associated Students that they go through safe-zone training,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Corey Lau followed by saying that he did not think funding for Greek life should necessarily be a top priority for A.S.</p>\n<p>“[Funding for Greek life] isn’t always something that should be necessarily pushed for,” Lau said. “We do have other issues on campus.”</p>\n<p>Later in the questioning, candidates were asked about the ways they would promote a healthier environment during large-scale events such as Deltopia and Halloween.</p>\n<p>DP’s Mario Vasquez said a major problem with big Isla Vista events has to do with inaccessibility to large portions of the student body.</p>\n<p>“It’s a travesty that these events aren’t for everyone, they’re not for all students,” Vasquez said. “It’s a travesty that I have homosexual friends, the queer community, that don’t feel safe walking around in pride festival shirts and are susceptible to hate crimes.”</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Jake Speyer said the school should continue supporting these events but place a larger emphasis on student safety.</p>\n<p>“I feel that we should start by saying that Deltopia and Halloween are traditions that UCSB holds and that we should absolutely not get rid of them,” Speyer said. “But with these traditions comes some things that we need to improve, such as infrastructure, education and awareness and community engagement.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the forum, candidates were asked to explain why they chose to run with their respective party. According to OPP candidates, their party policy — creating a new platform with every new group of candidates — allows for more original ideas and innovation. Several DP candidates said current DP senators have been more involved in the groups they were part of.</p>\n<p>Members from both parties emphasized their interest in diversity, each side arguing that their party represented every single UCSB student.</p>\n<p>Forums and debates will continue this week and the next. Still to come are the Presidential and Executive Officer debates, as well as the On-Campus Senator forum. Voting begins April 22 on GOLD.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 10th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50768\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50768\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/","id":3087,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3086,3085,3084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Holds Student-Run Textbook Trade","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Haley Kulik Staff Writer   Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board will host a Textbook Marketplace this afternoon in Storke Plaza from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m., in w...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Haley Kulik</p>\n<p>Staff Writer</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board will host a Textbook Marketplace this afternoon in Storke Plaza from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m., in which students can buy and sell their used textbooks in order to circumvent low buyback offers and high prices.</p>\n<p>The event will be divided into sections for each department and the direct trade will allow students to regulate the prices of their books rather than accept prices set by buyback companies or bookstores.</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, a third-year chemistry and biopsychology major and the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the Associated Students Office of the President, said the organization was inspired to host the event again after the success of last quarter’s marketplace.</p>\n<p>“We started this last quarter, but it actually used to be a common occurrence where students would just do this as part of the culture,” Lakhani said. “And we want to get that started again.”</p>\n<p>Last quarter’s marketplace offered students upwards of 10 times more money than corporate buyback companies would for used textbooks, according to Armen.</p>\n<p>“Last quarter was a great success, it was incredible to see students get $50 or $80 for a book they would get only $5 for at the corporate buy back tents, which really rip students off,” Armen said. “Tuition and book prices are outrageously expensive here — this is what student power looks like, not only advocacy but solutions — so we are hitting the problem on all fronts. We hope to truly institutionalize this so it happens every quarter and expect it to grow and grow.”</p>\n<p>Organizers will be holding students’ books for them, and will be responsible for overseeing the exchanges up to the close of the market. Student book-sellers will have to leave a slip of paper identifying which books belong to them, Lakhani said.</p>\n<p>According to Lakhani, students do not have to be present for the whole event in order to take advantage of the opportunity to buy and sell books.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t want to stick around for too long and you’re a seller, you can leave your contact info so people can contact you,” Lakhani said. “And if you’re a buyer you can leave a wish list so if a seller comes back later he or she can contact you then.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Office of the President is hoping to encourage trade between students, as this event will reduce the amount of money that students pay for textbooks. Lakhani said that A.S. will not be dealing with students’ money whatsoever since A.S. is simply putting on the event to provide a safe environment for students to exchange textbooks with each other.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just a common time and place for students to do this safely. We are not handling any money or even doing any trades for anybody. They’re dealing directly with other students,” said Lakhani.</p>\n<p>Arda Jooharian contributed to this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/associated-students-holds-student-run-textbook-trade/","id":3088,"author":{"id":199,"name":"Haley Kulik"},"related":[3087,3086,3085],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
