To help our freshman readers, the <em>Nexus</em> news staff interviewed five former and current Resident Assistants (RA) for advice on navigating dorm life.</p>\n<p>The interviewees:</p>\n<div

studies major Nicole Willard</p></div>\n<p>Their advice:</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: What is the best piece of advice you can give a freshman moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh</em>: Bring only what you need and be mindful that you’re sharing the room. It’s helpful to communicate with your roommate(s) before moving in so you can organize who is bringing what and avoid possibly bringing two fridges!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> “Just do it!!” Shia LaBeouf hits the nail on the head with this statement when it comes to being involved. When you first move in, you will feel intimidated by the whole experience. But don’t coop yourself up in your room! Your dorm intentionally plans many programs the first week of move-in so you can be social and meet new people. You will have such a better experience when you put yourself out there, and you could possibly make lifelong friends! Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself and get to know other people.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki</em>: The best piece of advice I can give to a freshman moving into the dorms is to make an effort to get to know the rest of the people on your floor or building. Some of these people will be your best friends for life. Also, don’t forget to take it all in. Moving into your first college dorm can get pretty overwhelming, but as long as you remain optimistic and hopeful, you can definitely make the most of your time here.</p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some things freshmen often forget to pack when moving into the dorms?</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Get yourself some baby oil! Once you walk along the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara, you will learn about the sticky tar that is almost impossible to get off of the bottom of your feet. Baby oil does the trick, and it will save you the pain of scrubbing those toes forever!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> Freshmen forget to bring air freshener! Sometimes those rooms get smelly and no one wants to be “that room.” I know a lot of freshmen also forget to bring business attire, for job interviews and such. Last thing, stamps!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What are some belongings freshmen often move in with that won’t be useful?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshmen definitely do not need to bring a printer since UCSB offers 200 free pages a quarter at various printing labs. Check out the free resources your campus offers!</p>\n<p><em>Perez:</em> Don’t bring clothes you don’t need! When you go visit your family for breaks, you can switch out clothes for the different seasons. This will give you so much more space for you and your roommates!</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen who don’t participate in the “party scene” get involved?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> RAs work really hard to plan programs weekly for residents to who don’t want to party. Residents can suggest ideas and even organize the programs with their RAs. If freshmen want to get involved, there’s SO MANY leadership and volunteer opportunities at UCSB such as Hall Council, RHA, Associated Students and various interest clubs!<br>\n<em>Isozaki:</em> There are plenty of organizations on campus that are excited and welcoming to new first-year members, ranging from activist groups to cultural groups to dance teams to video game clubs. Finding a job is a great way to get work experience, make friends and stay active. It’s also very possible to be involved in the party scene without drinking or doing drugs. The campus climate of UCSB is not about who drinks the most, it’s about having a good time.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki: </em>There is so much you can do. I think there is a strong misconception that every single person parties at UCSB, it’s definitely not true. There are so many student organizations that you can get involved in. If you log onto orgsync.com you can find a huge list of the many clubs and organizations we have on campus. Many of the RAs create programs that will have alternatives to the party scene. You will have many opportunities that will cater to your needs and interests.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> How can freshmen learn to get along with their new roommate(s)?</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is super important to have an open and honest discussion in the first few days you are there. Set some ground rules, and stick to them. There have been too many instances where one roommate doesn’t like something the other roommate is doing so they go ask their RA to fix it for them. When that happens, I don’t intervene until I know they have talked to their roommate about it. Also, being passive aggressive doesn’t work! Don’t do it. If you have a problem, try to be an adult and find a solution yourself. Also, sometimes it is just easier to let the small things go. If you have a mutual understanding and follow the rules you set at the beginning of the year, everything should be fine.</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> I think the main thing is just to have respect for one another. Having healthy communication and remaining transparent whenever it is necessary definitely promotes a positive living environment. Try to make an effort to get to know your roommate(s). I suggest to go to programs your RA plans together or find a place to eat in Isla Vista that you both have not tried yet.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> What’s a common mistake freshmen often make?</p>\n<p><em>Huynh:</em> Freshman should take advantage of the fresh new start that college gives them. They should reach out to others, be open-minded and try new things. The person you were in high school does not have to be the person you are in college. You literally can reinvent yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Not buying a U-lock for one’s bike! We are a biking campus and having a U-lock helps keep your bike from getting stolen. Also, choose a major based on passion, not pay, because there are so many opportunities in every major to excel in great things.</p>\n<p><em>DN:</em> Are there any other tips you would like to share with the class of 2019?</p>\n<p><em>Hunyh:</em> Set some academic and personal goals for yourself before starting college. Think about what you really want to achieve by the end of your first year and work towards it! It’s not bad to get lost or go with the flow, but make sure you’re always working towards something great!</p>\n<p><em>Willard:</em> It is imperative that freshmen learn time management and remember to not put off studying until finals week! Meet your professors and hall directors, go to office hours and don’t be afraid to use all of the campus resources, because they are there for you!</p>\n<p><em>Aranki:</em> Your freshman year goes by so fast! Take advantage of every single opportunity that comes your way. Remember to just breathe when things get tough. We have a wonderful community that will support your endeavors.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

international bestselling author Malala Yousafzai at a sold-out event on June 27 at the Arlington Theatre, with simulcasts at Campbell Hall and The New Vic.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-year-old Yousafzai grew up in Pakistan’s formerly Taliban-controlled Swat Valley where she advocated for women’s education after the Taliban declared no girls would be allowed to attend school. In response, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012. Having made a full recovery, she now continues her secondary education and activism in the United Kingdom. In October 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel laureate in history.</p>\n<p>The event consisted of a short explanation my Yousafzai regarding her life and activism, followed by a discussion and Q&amp;A session moderated by event sponsor and Malala Foundation board member Susan McCaw. McCaw presented questions pre-submitted by students at UCSB, Santa Barbara Middle School, Montecito Union Elementary and Harding University Partnership School.</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said the Swat Valley was “paradise” before the Taliban took control, but terrorism brought “darkness” to her community.</p>\n<p>“My life was a happy life and, suddenly, things changed,” Yousafzai said. “A villain came. This villain in our story was terrorism — Talibanization. Our peaceful valley turned from a place of tourism to a place of terrorism. More than 400 schools were destroyed at that time. People were flogged, killed; women were not allowed to go outside, girls’ education was banned and life became so hard.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said her father allowed her to go to school even though most girls in the Swat Valley did not, providing her with the foundation that allows her to advocate for fair treatment and education for women.</p>\n<p>“He treated me equally as my brothers,” Yousafzai said. “He allowed me to get education, and I was one of the luckiest girls who got this opportunity … He believed that if we want our society to go forward, if we want our country to succeed, we need to empower women.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she has fought for her own education and universal women’s education because it leads to individual empowerment.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, in a patriarchal society, women lack identity,” Yousafzai said. “They are wives, sisters, mothers, but they are never allowed to have the identity of an individual. I did not want to suffer through the situation of being only called the wife or the mother to someone.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she is “not a lone voice” in her advocacy for women’s education, because she represents all those who are denied the opportunities she seeks to create.</p>\n<p>“When I go and see presidents and prime ministers I say, ‘don’t think this is only this one girl, Malala, speaking to you, these are the girls in Nigeria, these are the girls in Kenya who do not get the opportunity to get their secondary school education,’” Yousafzai said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Effie Sklavenitis said the event taught her the importance of speaking on behalf of others to create change.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a voice, and just because you’re one person doesn’t mean you’re alone. It means that you have to speak up if you want things to change.” Sklavenitis said. “Even when people speak up against you, you still have to keep on talking and keep on expressing your points.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she sees many students in countries with universal education who do not value and take advantage of their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It’s really sad because, one side of the world, children are fighting, children are struggling for the right to go to school … even if they have to pay, even if they have to travel long distances, even if they have to face the difficulty of having no teachers or sitting in a classroom with 90 to 100 students,” Yousafzai said. “I think all the children who have this opportunity should be very thankful.”</p>\n<p>Third-year geology major Cassidy Meehan said the event prompted her to realize the value of the education she continues to receive.</p>\n<p>“It really made me feel inspired to take advantage of my education,” Meehan said. “It really made me realize, ‘wow, I’m really lucky to have this.’”</p>\n<p>According to Yousafzai, cultures that do not allow for or support women’s education can and should be changed.</p>\n<p>“These cultures and traditions, they are not sent by God from the sky and said that this is your culture and you have to follow it,” Yousafzai said. “It is we people who have made these cultures, and we have the right and duty to change them when they go against basic human rights.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and marine biology double major Francesca Pezzullo said she agreed with Yousafzai that culture should not inhibit human rights.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really interesting to say that we can change our culture, we can change our traditions,” Pezzullo said. “It’s not a good thing to hold on to if it’s impeding on people’s human rights. It’s very important for people to understand that you can’t just hold onto it because it’s familiar. That doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said the event showed her, despite Yousafzai’s influence and achievements, that the activist is also a “very normal” teenage girl.</p>\n<p>“She seemed like a very genuine person,” Pezzullo said. “She’s exceptional in her situation, but she seems like a down-to-earth person.”</p>\n<p>Sklavenitis said the event inspired her to consider how students’ actions in the United States affect the fight for basic human rights in other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for people to think about their own societies and their own actions every day and how that affects the bigger picture and how that affects anything from women’s rights to education for children, because everything is connected,” Sklavenitis said. “We may live in different places, but at the end of they day we live on the same planet.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said Yousafzai’s story demonstrates the effect one activist can have on an issue.</p>\n<p>“You have to be the one to see the change that you want to see happen, which is something that is hard for people to wrap their heads around because they feel like their life is so important personally, they don’t realize you have to actually do it yourself,” Pezzullo said. “Malala is a girl who just did it herself.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

tuition.</p></div>\n<p>The tuition increase plan will be discussed at the UC Board of Regents’ meeting on Nov. 18-20 at UC San Francisco Mission Bay and aims to stabilize tuition and fees, according to a UC statement released this past Thursday. According to the UCSA petition, the association will “actively lobby” UCOP and the Board of Regents, will write letters to Senators and Congressmen “expressing the resolution’s sentiments” and will conduct a system-wide survey to gather input about President Barack Obama’s “Plan to Make College More Affordable” and university rating system, and relay the feedback to the US Department of Education.</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Brooke Converse said the UC would work to minimize the increase in tuition by seeking additional funds from the state.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of the petition,” Converse said. “No one likes a tuition increase, least of all the University, but we hope to work with students to advocate for additional funding from the state to offset the potential increase.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite state funding increasing over the last two years, the UC still faces a long-term gap between projected revenues and its basic funding needs for educational programs.</p>\n<p>The UC still remains $460 million below its 2007–‘08 level of state funding, and is below what it needs to continue to meet its commitment to admitting all eligible California students and to “preserve the quality of a UC education,” according to the UC statement released last week.</p>\n<p>The UC also stated that additional state funding could allow UC to avoid a tuition increase.</p>\n<p>According to first-year pre-biology student Ashley Tringali, paying more tuition right now is justified and will likely pay off later on.</p>\n<p>“I have been reading articles about the changes that they want to make and I feel like right now we might have to pay more, but I am investing my money into a good education and hopefully I’ll be able to use that education,” Tringali said.</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics and global studies double major Kayla Saliba said she agrees with UCSA’s petition to put financial responsibility onto the state.</p>\n<p>“The state should not be cutting the money. But if that is not an option, then if you are cutting the funds that the school is getting, what is going to happen to the school?” Saliba said. “Already students and teachers are scrambling for resources. How are we going to pay for things that the university needs?”</p>\n<p>Tringali said increasing tuition to improve the UC is a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p>“I know the UCs … and especially here at UC Santa Barbara, we have great research and opportunities and connections,” Tringali said. “I feel like if I need to pay more now, yeah it might be bad financially for me right now, but I know it is going to pay off later. I am totally fine with investing in my future.”</p>\n<p>But according to Saliba, the state is obliged to provide affordable education for their public universities.</p>\n<p>“We should be getting more money, but it should not be coming from the students,” Saliba said, “it should be coming from the government, and that is a basic thing I feel we need to start doing as a nation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Food Co-Op but changed location due to rainy weather. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">During the meeting, forum-attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Commission with jurisdiction over planning in I.V., the university’s plans to potentially provide housing for staff in I.V. and the possible creation of an elected “police collaborative board,” responsible for meeting with local law enforcement periodically to discuss law enforcement-related issues in I.V. </span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In regard to the proposed Area Planning Commission, <span class=\"st\">—</span> which would function through the County Board of Supervisors and specialized Community Services District (CSD), if the Special District is approved and passed <span class=\"st\">—</span> Abboud said the commission would approve building projects and their regulations as either a potential function of the CSD or possibly the CSD itself.<br>\n</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Schunk, I.V.’s historical divide between students and non-student residents has caused a disconnect that has led to I.V. becoming an unsafe neighborhood that disenfranchises many residents. With an Area Planning Commission, housing in I.V. would be more subject to housing and safety regulations than is the case currently, according to Schunk.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Amid discussion regarding the potentiality of I.V. self-governance in the form of a Community Services District (CSD) brand of governance, a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC), cityhood, or other options, Abboud and Schunk expressed their support for a CSD, which would levy a utility users tax onto residents in order to raise funding for implementation of local projects.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Freeman, however, said he felt that current and previous self-governance discussions have been unfairly centered on the establishment of a CSD and that more education about possible cityhood for I.V. as well as other forms of self-governance, should be publicized to I.V. residents. </span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A CSD is not able to pass laws. It is only able to provide services,” Freeman said. “All the things that regularly plague I.V. require legislation to fix, not services. The things that CSD can provide don’t go far enough.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The forum concluded with attendees agreeing that information about I.V. self-governance and its related meetings should be better disseminated and advertised to residents, such as students and Latino families, via back-to-back forums held in areas residents feel comfortable meeting. The next I.V. self-governance town hall meeting will be hosted shortly after Schunk takes office. </span></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[Correction 11/17/14:</strong> An earlier version of this article stated that, during the Nov 14 meeting, “attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Committee to allow affordable housing options in I.V. to non-students— primarily university staff” when in fact the Area Planning Commission only gives jurisdiction over planning in I.V., not over what kind of housing the university provides. Also, the plan to provide housing for UCSB staff in I.V. is not related to self-governance and is in fact solely a function and idea of the University.</em></p>\n<p><em> In addition, an earlier version of this article stated that “Abboud said the [Area Planning Committee]’s potential implementation would likely be through the university and would be responsible for infrastructure maintenance and the distribution of student and non-student residents throughout I.V.” when in fact the Area Planning Commission would function through the County Board of Supervisors and potential future Special District and would not be responsible for infrastructure maintenance. It also has nothing to do with the university. </em></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus <em>regrets these errors.]</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/","id":3444,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3443,3442,3441],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
