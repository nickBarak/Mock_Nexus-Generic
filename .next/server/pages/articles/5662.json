I’m not really sure there is another campus in the world that can replicate the bubble of seclusion and charm that our one square mile of duplexes provides. However, since the day I graduated from high school, there has been a growing sense of restlessness that I can only attribute to my inner need to be doing something substantial with all the time I am allocated on this earth. While I appreciate the perks of studying in such an environment (our school is on a goddamn beach with skies that provide their own Instagram filters), I can’t help but feel my life has stagnated due to the bubble in which I.V. resides. There are only so many Sands Beach sunsets and die tossings before the shine begins to lose its luster. I may not have verbally expressed this, but as I left UCSB, part of me was hoping that I wouldn’t come back to campus.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85239\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85239\" data-attachment-id=\"85239\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=85239\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85239\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/study-abroad-art-e1543903307311.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia Spritzer / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A change of pace was needed, and I jumped at the chance to move to London: a city that is much larger and much more diverse than where I had resided for the past two years. And I love it. It’s loud. There is no time to pause and take a breath. People in suits, tracksuits and puffy jackets bustle in and out of every little corner imaginable. Sarcasm oozes from many of its inhabitants. For the first time, I don’t feel like a wandering entity unable to find something worth latching onto. I feel as if I am a functioning cog in a machine much bigger than I can comprehend. It might sound contradictory with my need for importance, but I enjoy the anonymity that comes with living in a city with more than eight million people. I can write my own story without the shackles of familiarity combined with preconceived notions of myself and life itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And write my own story I have, as I have dived into things I have been too scared to dive into before, participated in things I can’t participate in back home and explored places I only dreamed of exploring. I can safely say there is no place on earth I’d rather be in this current moment. I can’t imagine anyone becoming disenchanted with this place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why on earth would you leave California for here?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The weather alone is going to leave you clinically depressed by mid-November.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s great and all, I get it, but this place is exhausting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as I had become disillusioned with the vibrant sunshine and peaceful bike rides back home, these people I encountered had experienced the same fatigue with their environment as I had, despite the vast difference in lifestyles the two settings provide.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They, too, were unsettled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I thought about it, it made sense. Despite my own beliefs in my societal integration, I am still a foreigner purposely seeking out the good in an environment I am excited to be present in. The cons of annoyances have not settled in due to the fact that it is very new to me and that “very new” is exactly what I’m seeking. What was my boredom back home was someone else’s rare chance to simmer down and calm their busy brain. I had complete access to a world they don’t usually experience, and they couldn’t process why I would leave it. Their home was to me what mine was to them. We shared the exact same feelings. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen to me if I stayed here? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grass is always greener on the other side” is an overused and cliche saying, but it rings true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this desire to grow up fast while still working out the kinks of immaturity a healthy combination? What’s to tell me these times at UCSB aren’t the “good old days” that I’ll remember fondly in 15 years? Am I moving too fast while wanting to go even faster?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I ever be able to look around and say I truly feel content if I am always yearning for the next adventure or the next experience? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on this, I couldn’t help being drawn to a particular thought. Everytime I come home to my hometown, exiting the 280 freeway, this wave of calmness and comfort washes over me. As I weave through the hills and watch the sunlight trickle through familiar trees and neighborhoods, I can’t help but think fondly back to the memories and feelings I associate with the place. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be a fleeting feeling before my desire to leave eventually takes over, but the comfort my hometown provides is always there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m only 20 years young, and I am not sure if I’m ready to fully leave that comfort behind. I’m close. But not just yet. The world is a large place, and I intend to inhabit as much of it as possible. My London experience in itself has been more than I could have ever asked for. But these places are not going anywhere; I’ve got a little bit of time. I’ve got a life back home I still need to take care of. A crisp and sudden break is not a fitting end for my first two years of college. For the first time in my life, I should attempt to actively enjoy slowing down. Maybe it’s OK to “gather my rosebuds while I may” for a little bit longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2019, I will be back in Isla Vista. There is no guarantee I won’t fall right back into the funk of a routine I had become accustomed to. But with the potential experiences and future I now know lie ahead of me, I trust myself to acknowledge the bigger picture that life has painted for me. This is one chapter of a longer story. With that in mind, I think I’ll be OK enjoying the ride and sitting back while watching that damn beautiful Sands Beach sunset for the next 18 months. After all, I do want to graduate on time.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti is learning that a little familiarity is okay.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

Racism affects different marginalized groups in different ways, and I can only speak from my own experiences.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past weeks, the nature of the pandemic and escalation of racism against Asian Americans has made me reflect on my own identity. The degree in which I have personally felt racism from others has been, thankfully, small. I can attribute this to the facts that I was born in California, speak English and grew up in a predominantly white community. I learned at a young age the right way to fit in among my peers and how to properly be the “token” Asian friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re so white for an Asian, like a Twinkie!” (You know, white on the inside, yellow on the outside.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re the whitest Asian I know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such seemingly “harmless,” if not incredibly ignorant, comments extended beyond friends and peers describing my “whiteness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Your dad speaks English really well! He sounds so American.” That would be because he was born in Minnesota and grew up in California, speaking English as his first — and only — language. Did I mention he’s also American? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never realized your mom has such a heavy Asian accent,” the grown man said. He then proceeded to provide his best imitation of a stereotypical Asian accent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an immigrant who moved to America when she was 12 years old, my mother was experiencing the cultural shock of being in a new country and learning English as a second language. At this point in her life, her father had already passed away and her mother would pass away months after they moved to the United States. I was — and still am — incredibly proud of my mother for the trials she has overcome, a language barrier being one of them. Even before I fully understood what racism meant, I was still astonished, and inwardly cringing, that someone would make such an ignorant joke at the expense of my mom’s “heavy accent.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only after recently listening to Jiayang Fan, a staff writer at The New Yorker, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/podcasts/the-daily/racism-chinese-coronavirus-asian-americans.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak about her own story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an episode of “The Daily” podcast, did I recognize the “probational” nature of being Asian American. Would my experience be different if I was an immigrant? If my first language was Chinese or Vietnamese? If I didn’t have an American accent? If I didn’t understand English grammar and slang? Oh, absolutely. Even having a name like Calista, which originates from Greek, rather than a traditional Chinese or Vietnamese name, has factored into my experience as an Asian American.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in such uncertain times. The anxiety, loneliness and fear many Americans are feeling is completely valid. Like many others, I fear contracting the virus and the ramifications this would have for the family members I am sheltered with right now. And yet, many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault. Although I have not been a </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">target of racial slurs or hate crimes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the pandemic, I know the same cannot be said for others who look like me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Words have power. Whether it’s a racial slur yelled by a bigot or an ignorant joke made at the expense of a minority group, these words leave a lasting impression. The language President Donald Trump uses in regard to COVID-19 disregards the </span><a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Health Organization’s practices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of refraining from using geographic locations to name new infectious diseases in order “to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.” Such language, spoken by the president no less, allows for the continuation of racism and xenophobia in our country. The virus is not an excuse for racism. Fear itself is not an excuse. Ignorance is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no excuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although racism is a deep-rooted problem that the U.S. has carried throughout its history, there are still ways we can mitigate the pain and suffering it inflicts in our daily lives. Being conscious of the language we use and holding others accountable to do the same is a start. If you are in a position of privilege, then use that power to defend someone who is being targeted and be an advocate for the disenfranchised. At the very least, how about, just don’t be a racist? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am grateful for the opportunities I have had growing up as an American. I am proud to be half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. I hope to one day be proud of my country too.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu would like people to just stop being racist.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

Going abroad can therefore represent a second ‘coming out’, and you will need to make decisions about how and when to express your LGBTQ identity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very thoughtful way to say, “as a queer person, not all countries are safe for you.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll a little further and you’ll find “</span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk Levels and Risk Mitigation Strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This is the first thing that any queer person considering going abroad should look at. Included is a link to a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uJKCx7Zn_HGF4QNjW4FzAUEmkYHlzXyOCdu1Zp5kGY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Doc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a country by country breakdown. In this breakdown each country is labeled either “very safe,” “mostly safe,” “unsafe” and “very unsafe,” with some being “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” They also go on to define qualities that make “extreme risk,” “high risk” or “moderate risk” countries. Quick spoiler alert: Of the 39 countries listed, only two get the coveted title of “very safe” (Canada and Argentina).   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before coming across this very valuable document, I had spoken to a UCEAP peer advisor. I told her that I was interested in maybe going to a country in Africa. She was very kind and helpful and informed me that there are more scholarship opportunities for certain countries because they tend to have fewer applicants. She suggested Ghana, since she had studied there herself and loved it. After discovering the country-by-country risk breakdown, I looked up Ghana and found out it is considered “unsafe” for LGBTQ folks, as there are “explicit restrictions on LGBTIA+ expression &amp; rights,” and “governmental &amp; societal treatment is poor.” Okay, so maybe not Ghana. But this must be an exception, right? Surely there can’t be many study abroad options that are unsafe for so many students at this school?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After nixing Ghana, I did a bit more research and found a summer internship abroad opportunity in South Africa. It sounded interesting and relevant to my future, so I decided to check out its risk level:  “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” Yes! This was a win. South Africa it is. After all, it says queer PDA </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead to violence and tension, as opposed to Russia where it says queer PDA is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to cause violence and tension, or in Ghana where male-male relationships could lead to imprisonment for 10 or more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why am I so excited about what feels like less than the bare minimum? I’d much prefer a place that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> safe. Not neutral. While it’s a better option than Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Jordan, Senegal or Indonesia — all of which are considered high-risk countries — I’d still prefer to study in a place where I can be sure my identity won’t endanger me if it comes up in conversation. So can I go to South Africa? The answer is yes, but I’m still scared. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful to have this list, because I’m sure there was a time when it didn’t exist at all. I’m grateful that I have the information I need to keep myself safe, but there is still something so scary about it. This list is a reminder to me that so much of the world still doesn’t accept this community. The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world. When I sing along in the shower to Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan or Frank Ocean, I feel seen and heard, but there are so many people who cannot feel seen or heard because they are afraid for their lives. I can proudly go see Trixie Mattel at a school-sponsored event and know that I am surrounded by literally hundreds of other students who couldn’t care less whether or not I like girls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, other times, I’m afraid too. Sometimes I get nervous holding my girlfriend’s hand when I find myself travelling outside of my bubble. I wonder what the risk level is for the United States — depending on where you are, the answer may change. Even California, a place that most would consider pretty safe for minorities, has 83 hate groups as of 2018 — </span><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/by-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than any other U.S. state. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to other LGBTQ students out there considering studying abroad: Do your research and utilize the resources available to us. I long for the day when we don’t have to worry about our physical safety when making decisions like this and when I can browse naively, as I did when the world was my oyster. I know that I don’t “look” queer, and many foreign laws around homosexuality are targeted at men so, in theory, I could still go to Ghana or Russia and probably be fine. But the fact remains that the world is not my oyster, because no class credit is worth going back in the closet. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes safe travels to all the global Gauchos out there.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Hebrew school was a place where I met other people like me: kids whose families celebrated Shabbat on Fridays, whose ancestors also came to America fleeing the horrors of World War II, who wanted to party it up at their own bar or bat mitzvahs in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience was unique in that I was brought up in a reformed sect of Judaism, one that explored how traditional ideas could be reexamined in a modern context. At Hebrew school, whether making crafts celebrating the Jewish holidays or in song sessions with the cantor, we were always encouraged to ask questions. As we got older, this extended to encouragement to question the texts we were learning about. There was a surprising amount of recognition that parables written thousands of years ago could reasonably be considered outdated today. The emphasis was always on taking from Judaism what you wanted. Nothing was strictly imposed on us except for good morals and the occasional splash of Zionism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s right: Pro-Israel rhetoric ran forcefully through the underlying messages of my generally progressive temple on a regular basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In seventh grade, we learned about the Jewish holy sites in Israel but not about the complicated histories of bloody political conflicts that gave us access to them. In eighth grade, we learned about the Israeli Defense Forces, but nothing about who they were fighting against. And in my high school confirmation class, we sat through PowerPoint presentations highlighting the incredible success of Israel’s recent technological advances without any reference to their equally fast-growing weapons technology.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never once was there any mention of Palestine. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is visiting this country with an organization like Birthright Israel endorsing a political view that I do not hold? </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the United States was actually </span><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/us-israel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the first nations to recognize Israel’s sovereignty </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 1948 and has remained a steadfast ally since then. While this alliance may have devolved from a moral stance into something more akin to a strategic asset, positive relations between the U.S. and Israel have remained surprisingly constant throughout the turbulent histories of both countries. The United States has also historically played a significant role as a mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, a role that has increasingly favored Israel as a result of the budding love affair between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two make quite the couple. Where previous Democratic American presidents have pushed Netanyahu to consider a two-state solution, the Israeli Prime Minister has </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/825371795972825089?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he can now trade ideas on voter suppression and the building of walls with our current President. Both fond of </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/the-trump-netanyahu-alliance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bullying members of the press and unwilling to engage</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in negotiation with Palestine, it comes as no surprise that both leaders appeal to the racists and absolutists of the right wings of their respective countries. Both have been served multiple </span><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/01/28/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-on-charges-of-bribery-fraud-and-breach-of-trust-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indictment charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Trump for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and Netanyahu for breach of trust — in their respective nations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To consummate their blossoming relationship, it seems that Trump believes that he and Jared Kushner can single handedly succeed where almost a century of diplomatic relations surrounding Israel and Palesine could not. While confidently boasting to have finally found a viable path to a Palestinian state, this claim only distracts from further disregard for Palestinian rights. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/28/21111890/trump-israel-palestine-peace-plan-deal-century-apartheid\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s so-called “peace plan”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concedes to labeling Palestine a state as it continues to cement its dependence on Israel. Trump’s proposal divides up Palestinian territories and surrounds them with Israeli ones, essentially giving Israel total security and economic control over Palestinian lands and rendering any Palestinian government powerless. Since its proposal, the plan has largely been </span><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-most-immediate-unexpected-threat-of-trumps-middle-east-peace-plan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">viewed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a call for Israel to annex the West Bank territory, but no action has been taken yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to escalate, I find that despite any hypothetical connection to Israel that my Jewish identity might encompass, I remain utterly repulsed by its government’s repeated aggressions as an occupying power, as well as the actions of “my own country” in support of this abuse of power. I have been openly and loudly critical of President Trump, and now I’m starting to recognize that his actions are being mirrored by Prime Minister Netanyahu. While many liberal American Jews don’t think twice about criticizing the various horrific actions of our President, they are reluctant to extend the same criticism to Israel’s Prime Minister because of the link between Judaism and Israel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This link is largely perpetuated by the idea that Israel exists as a Jewish birthright. Birthright, under the guise of being an apolitical educational experience, largely promotes Israeli military propaganda and ignores any Palestinian narratives about the reality of life under Israeli military rule. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jewish claim to Israel is at best a questionable one. In reality, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/the-meaning-of-nakba-israel-palestine-1948-gaza/560294/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">land was won in a brutal series of wars</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that repeatedly displaced and exiled the indigenous population of Palestinians. This history is intentionally ignored by the glorified education experience that Birthright provides. This program ignores the current reality of occupation, features various pro-Israel speakers and conveniently avoids bringing young Jews to the West Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recently added staple of the Birthright experience is what the organization calls a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/where-birthright-went-wrong/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mega Event,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can only be described as a glorified propaganda show. Modeled after music festivals, the event is headlined by popular Israeli bands and is put on specifically for the participants of Birthright. However, the event is funded primarily by pro-Israel billionaires, including Las Vegas tycoon Sheldon Adelson. That’s right, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/12/14/sheldon-adelson-trump-macau/#2554f58021c7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Trump’s largest donors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout his 2016 election is also funding Birthright. The man who influenced Trump’s decision to </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/sheldon-adelson-trump-middle-east-policy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">violate the Iran nuclear deal and to move the U.S. embassy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Israel to Jerusalem is also who was chosen to speak at one of the largest Birthright events of the year in 2018. By supporting Birthright, these are the people and political messages you are endorsing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What once was universally viewed as a Jewish rite of passage has now become a source of protest. Participants in Birthright are now beginning to </span><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-young-jews-walk-off-birthright-trip-to-join-anti-occupation-activity-1.6271943\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk off the trip</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in protest of the lack of attention it pays to the realities of Israeli occupation. This is the beginning of a more modern resistance that refuses to let Jewish identity be manipulated for the Israeli government’s political motives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birthright does not build Jewish community. It encourages blind faith to an oppressive state and right-wing regime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I refuse to be the same kind of “progressive” that the temple of my childhood unwittingly perpetuated </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the convenient kind of progressive. The kind that allows you to pick and choose which human rights abuses deserve scorn. The kind that gives blind allegiance to the Israeli government. The aspects of my Jewish upbringing that I love and treasure have taught me to be critical and ask all the questions that I can about things that others claim to be fact. Being Jewish has always helped fuel my social activism. Staying silent now would be nothing less than hypocritical. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Kocis is tired of her Jewish identity being manipulated for a country’s political gain. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.
