Alia Reynolds, president and UCSB coordinator of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), led conversation with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel discussed plans to further educate students on sexual assault prevention, including expanding mandatory sexual violence and harassment training to all clubs and sports teams and putting trainings online through GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key distinction between SASA and UCSB’s position about what action to take in light of recent allegations is the university’s mutual no-contact orders, which state that neither respondent or survivor can be near one another in shared public spaces. SASA, per Reynolds, claimed during the town hall that this prohibits survivors from accessing areas integral to their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA supports California Senate Bill 493, which, as Reynolds explained in the meeting, aims to ensure that sexual assault survivors have equal access to education through the abolition of mutual no-contact orders and resources for survivors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC currently does not support the abolition of mutual no-contact orders, SASA explained during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the panel discussion, Tallin Moyer, a member of SASA and Pi Beta Phi sorority, read a statement on sexual violence in Greek life and requested updates on other concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Greek life can provide a facility for leadership and self-growth — however, it is unacceptable that we as a Greek community have not realized the true magnititude of how our system enables sexual violence,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of Greek life need to realize how fraternities foster rape culture and put individual safety at risk. It is unacceptable to think these events have occurred in a vacuum.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public comment, one Greek life-affiliated student voiced her concerns about Sigma Pi’s participation in Arrowjam, an annual dance competition hosted by sorority Pi Beta Phi in order to raise money for Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve — a charity dedicated to children’s literacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moyer, whose sorority hosted the philanthropy, told the student that she understood the concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree with you, that was not taken into consideration at all, and I hear you, that it could be triggering to see them up there … It was the opinion of some of the women in our sorority that not all the men in Sigma Pi should be punished for the actions of a few. But I totally understand the concern, and [we] will be talking to our president about it,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigma Pi went on to compete and win the fraternity portion of the competition, which occurred on Nov. 8, eight days before the SASA Town Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA also promoted its Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map at the town hall. The map, facilitated by SASA, includes the UCSB campus and surrounding Isla Vista community. Anyone can anonymously report instances of sexual violence or harassment, which are pinned onto the digital map. Yellow pins stand for one report at a location and red stands for multiple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s mostly faith-based, although I am cautious about calling it that, but we are in the sense of believing survivors. But we see everything that goes through, and we monitor it closely,” Moyer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds then inquired to administrators about the Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) training email, which was sent to the entire student body on Nov. 1, soon after a timely warning email was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a reported sexual assault at Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally were concerned about the timeliness of the email about R.A.D., because obviously it was sent out during a very triggering, emotional time for many students,” she said. “The email only served to increase these feelings. We were also concerned that the email mentioned only women, which seemed to exclude men and gender non-conforming folks.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ollman, representative for SBSO, explained that while the timing of the email was unfortunate, it had already been scheduled and pre-selected. R.A.D. training is heavily overviewed by the national organization and leaves little room for individual departments to change gender pronouns or create more inclusive wording, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation regarding email alerts for the student body was another topic of discussion throughout the town hall. UCSB has two forms of communication for alerts: emergency notifications and timely warnings, which fall under Clery Act jurisdiction. The Clery Act mandates public safety reports on specific crime categories, including sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency notifications are “designed to give information about ongoing threats,” UCPD’s Community Service Officer Ariel Bournes explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Timely Warning Notices fall under a different, highly specific category of warning, and failing to issue one that meets the criteria means a potential fine of up to $57,300, according to Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we become aware of something that violates the Clery Act, we are mandated to report it, simply because a report has been filed and not because it has been investigated. The university is mandated to send Clery warnings only about Clery crimes that occur on university property… it’s a really bizarre, unique set of circumstances,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also inquired about the safety prevention tips issued in one such timely warning, including covering one’s drink or never taking drinks from strangers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel like the burden is being placed on the survivor once again, especially when the tips are things like, ‘Cover your drink, don’t take drinks from strangers,’ she explained to Ashlock. “We know these things. These things aren’t new to us. You are expecting people to control their own safety, in a sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlcok responded by stating that “one of the challenges of violence prevention education is coming at it from all these different angles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to have a clear message against violence in the community. There is not one proven method of violence prevention. There are a lot of different things, and not all of them feel good even to us, but we want to provide a variety of tools so in aggregate we reduce the rates of violence in our community,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, many students still had concerns about the existence of sexual violence within UCSB’s Greek life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just put a Band-Aid over this,” Moyer said in response to one student concerned about a lack of accountability within fraternities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To truly eradicate this culture and make a change, we can’t just remove one specific fraternity, but instead perform surgery on our culture as a Greek community.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

He started by describing how the center, then known as the Queer Resource Center, was first started by a group of student activists in 1999 after the death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The students] organized to convince Chancellor Yang, who was here then and is still here now, that we needed a specific resource center for LGBTQ students. At the time that MCC existed, as well as the Women’s Center. But there was no university-funded space for LGBTQ students,” Leets explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff members then began a video call with former students, staff and activists who had worked with the center in the past, all of whom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflected on the activism involved with the RCSGD to celebrate it.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabrina Kwist, dean of equity and inclusion at Los Medanos College, who was a key part of the activism behind the founding of the RCSGD, was on the call and spoke to attendees about the experience of creating the center.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kyle Richards, the director of the RCSGD from 2002 to 2007, the center was originally located on the third floor of the University Center (UCen), next to University and Community Housing Services — Leets said that this was why the kickoff was held in the UCen as opposed to the center’s current location on the third floor of the Student Resource Building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The center was on] the third floor next to the community housing office and it was a small lounge and an office with a desk and a little library and then some sofas and that was about it,” Richards said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was during my time here that we moved over … That was when the Student Resource Building was first built and we were one of the first tenants that moved into it when it was opened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also during Richards’ time as director that the center changed its name from the Queer Resource Center to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, citing concerns that “queer” was inapplicable to people who did not identify as such.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a concern that the word ‘queer’ may be off-putting to some people, or they may be scared or didn’t identify as queer. So we wanted a name that was more inclusive to people, that felt like a broader terminology that was more representative of the greater community,” Richards explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He joked that despite the center’s name change, “RCSGD” wasn’t quite the nice, quick acronym they had hoped for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Richards, during the center’s early days it only had a very small budget to work with, so the center would partner with other campus organizations such as the MultiCultural Center and the Women’s Center to bring in speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it was a queer-related theme, then we would co-sponsor it with them and add it to a programming calendar of events that we would distribute.

Besides having also won five pennants, this team took it all the way to the top in 2015 only to lose the World Series to the reigning American League champions, the Kansas City Royals. It seems evident that this New York team is fired up and ready to claim the title as their own this year.</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>, </em>Madison Bumgarner is likely to pitch for the Giants against the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard. Affectionately known as “Madbum” and “Thor,” these two power players have both played solid seasons with their teams going 15-9 and 14-9 while on the mound, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bumgarner, a 27-year-old from North Carolina, made his MLB debut in 2009 and has impressed the baseball world ever since. Although he was part of three World Series champion teams and has won numerous individual accolades, 2014 remains his best year to date.</p>\n<p>He was the winner of the Babe Ruth Award, named NLCS MVP, as well as World Series MVP in addition to his exceptional performance in postseason. Out of high school, he was selected tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants and has only continued to improve his abilities as a player and a teammate.</p>\n<p>Syndergaard, only having made his debut in May of 2015, has been a firecracker on the field and an enormous asset to his team. Drafted 38th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, this Texan quickly worked his way to the top leaving a notable trail behind him.</p>\n<p>In 2013, he started for Team USA in the Futures Game and by the end of the year was ranked the 11th-best prospect in baseball by<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>.</em> He performed with outstanding ability in the 2015 World Series as a rookie and became the second- youngest Met to win a World Series game. Although he is newer to the big leagues, Syndergaard has certainly proven his worth, not to mention his knack for strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The winner of this game will advance to the divisional round of the National League playoffs on Friday where they will meet the top seeded Chicago Cubs. During the 2016 season, both Wild Card candidates have been evenly matched with the National League Central team.</p>\n<p>In May, the Giants defeated the Cubs two games to one, yet in September San Francisco lost at home in a four-game series, losing the set 3-1.</p>\n<p>Alternately, in early July the Mets swept the Cubs when playing on their own turf, but lost the three game set at Wrigley Field, 2-1.</p>\n<p>This year’s potential World Series candidates are at their strongest and working their hardest. While a majority of the 2016 Major League Baseball Season has been exciting, nothing compares to the intensity of postseason play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/","id":3330,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[3329,3328,3327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Executive Director Marisela Márquez said while there is “no way of knowing” the size of the crowd for Wednesday’s meeting, the Senate generally moves to a larger space when it is “a kind of topic that very likely people will want to comment on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Senate leaders expected a larger crowd due to the nature of the resolution’s topic, approximately 20 people were present for Wednesday’s meeting — a number which decreased to approximately five by the end of action items for the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have heard from many students that this resolution is important to them and that they support it,” Ferguson said in an email. “They have said that President Trump’s actions affect all of us, and they have emphasized the importance of holding our President accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a Senator, I have the duty of representing my constituents with diligence and intention. I feel that it is my duty to express my support for the impeachment of President Trump, as his actions affect my constituents lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also discusses the whistleblower within the Trump Administration who </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html?module=inline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came forward</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August with concerns about a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower accused Trump of pressuring Zelensky to gather damaging information on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls Trump’s alleged actions “illegal” and writes that it is “Congress’s duty to impeach a President who commits high crimes and misdemeanors while in office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It sets a bad precedent to allow a sitting President to commit crimes while in office and get away with it when the President of the United States is expected to abide by all of the laws of the United States of America,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson emphasized in his email that he believes the Senate has a “moral responsibility” to pass the resolution and set a precedent for action on future national political decisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With a school as politically engaged as UCSB, I think there is an importance of taking stances on major political issues like this,” Ferguson said. “I do believe the majority of the student body would support passing this resolution.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the passage of the resolution, Ferguson believes Senate will continue passing more resolutions around national political issues in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think we will feel more comfortable in the future as a Senate with taking stances on major political issues. I implore the Senate to consider discussing political issues further in the future as I believe all political actions should start at the grassroots level.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution can be viewed in full <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A-Resolution-in-Support-of-Impeaching-and-Removing-President-Donald-J.-Trump-from-the-Office-of-President-of-the-United-States.pdf\">here</a>.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
