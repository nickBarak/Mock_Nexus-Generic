Photographs published in his earlier book<em> Juvenile in Justice</em> have been on exhibit nationwide and used as a tool for advocates for juvenile justice system reform. Images from his new book are currently on display on the first floor of the library.</p>\n<p>Ross, who previously worked as a photographer for <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> and the<em> New York Times</em>, said he wants his exhibits and books to spark change in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a judge; I’m not a probation officer. I’m an artist; I’m a human being,” Ross said. “I decided with my work I’m going to use art as a weapon.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids. – Art professor and photographer Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Ross, one of the underlying issues within the juvenile justice system is that “as a society, we bully kids.”</p>\n<p>“If you bully someone who is a person of color, you might get some pushback, you might be sued,” Ross said. “Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while there have been improvements made in the system since the publication of <em>Juvenile in Justice</em> three years ago, the situation for incarcerated girls has worsened.</p>\n<p>“The population of girls increases in relation to boys and girls have unique problems,” Ross said. “That’s why I published the book on girls to focus exactly on what’s going on with them.”</p>\n<p>Ross shared dozens of examples of his images, including one comparison between a detention cell in El Paso, Texas to one at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>“This holds the worst terrorist in the world. This holds a ten-year-old,” Ross said. “What’s the difference between the two? Who has the window? The terrorist, not the kid. I start presenting images like this to state and federal authorities . . . I start creating a bit of a buzz.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60470\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60470\" data-attachment-id=\"60470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984185\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60470\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=335%2C223\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"335\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Ross said the plan to eliminate the use of solitary confinement at the Rikers Island complex, an institution he described as “nefarious,” is a move in the right direction, but that he will believe in substantial change “when he sees it.”</p>\n<p>“For four years I’ve been trying to get into Rikers and I’ve been told by the head of detention . . . by [Mayor] Bloomberg, by [Mayor] De Blasio, by judges, ‘You’ll never get into Rikers in this lifetime,’” Ross said. “New York State and North Carolina are the two states that default and have kids automatically tried or looked at as adults. It’s a terrible system and I hope Rikers gets better.”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, while solitary confinement is an issue of national importance, it also pervades the local justice system in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The state is supposed to act as the parent when the parent can’t,” Ross said. “But these are the closets that we put kids in. They’re under the guise of administrative segregation, time-out rooms and desensitization rooms. In Santa Barbara, I interviewed a kid that was in there for three weeks.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while visiting a detention center in Monterey Park, Calif., he came to understand that the large percentage of incarcerated youths are victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“I asked the director what percentage of girls had been sexually abused when they come here,” Ross said. “He said ‘What percentage? Every one of them. All 88 girls in our custody have been sexually abused’ and then he said ‘and most of the boys.’ They’re all victims of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Jessica Sparks, an assistant with the Davidson Library Outreach Department and a third-year English and Renaissance studies major, said she was shocked by the sheer number of incarcerated youth that Ross’s project has revealed have been abused.</p>\n<p>“I thought it wasn’t that many, but hearing it was all of them it brings a whole new level of depth to the pictures downstairs,” Sparks said.</p>\n<p>According to Ross, many children in the juvenile justice system are suffering the consequences of their parents’ poor decisions.</p>\n<p>“A girl that was doing 35 years — she murdered somebody,” Ross said. “She was high on meth. Her mother gave her meth when she was seven. This girl has already served about ten years . . . she was sentenced at 14 and is going to serve until she’s 34.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community. These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result. – Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ross said one director of a detention center shared with him the difficulty of protecting transgender youth within the system.</p>\n<p>“Often they are thrown out of their family and have to respond with survival — sex to eat, to sleep, to live,” Ross said. “The director said [of a male to female transgender youth] ‘If I put her in with the girls, she’ll be hurt. If I put her in with the boys, she’ll be killed. I keep her in isolation, I know it’s against federal law . . . But she is not going to be killed on my watch.’”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, African American and Latino youths are at a higher risk of being tried as adults.</p>\n<p>“Latino youth are four time more likely to receive an adult sentence for the same crime as white children,” Ross said. “African American youth are nine times more likely.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and communication double major Alexis Lin, who took an art class with Ross last Spring quarter, said it is a glaring issue that the majority of the incarcerated are of color.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of youth get stereotyped into certain categories and that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Ross said he often thought of the difference between his own children’s upbringing and that of incarcerated youth while visiting detention centers.</p>\n<p>“Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community,” Ross said. “These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Hector Sanchez Castaneda said he also thought of his family when he learned about the living conditions of incarcerated youth in America.</p>\n<p>“When I saw the pictures downstairs, on the first floor of the library, when I saw the little girl — she’s my sister’s age, eight-years-old,” Sanchez-Castaneda said. “It broke my heart to see a little girl like that with no family whatsoever to support her.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60469\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60469\" data-attachment-id=\"60469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1065%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1065,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984014\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60469\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-682x1024.jpg?resize=270%2C405\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?w=1065&amp;ssl=1 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art professor and photographer Richard Ross. <i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to Ross, communities are better off when detention centers are closed and resources are invested elsewhere in the community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been closing down a lot of these mass incarceration institutes, especially for kids,” Ross said. “We’ve turned a corner and crime hasn’t gone up . . . the data proves that the more you release kids and give resources to the community, the better the outcomes for kids and communities remain safe.”</p>\n<p>Ross said there are still significant changes that need to be made in the juvenile justice system and hopes his photos will play a part in communicating the need for reform.</p>\n<p>“What’s the common visual vocabulary: that if somebody sees a picture, you think about it,” Ross said. “I want to create that. I want to have images that haunt you, that when you think of kids in the system you have them looking back at you saying don’t forget me.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

<em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two professors from McGill University and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies gave keynote lectures at the Mosher Alumni House to celebrate the opening of the Confucius Institute on campus yesterday.</p>\n<p>The first lecture, “Globalizing Regions: the Spread of Southeast Chinese Daoist Ritual Traditions to Southeast Asia,” was given by East Asian Studies Professor Kenneth Dean of McGill University. Immediately following Dean, Professor of Trade &amp; Economic Diplomacy at the Middlebury Institute and Institute for Trade and Commercial Diplomacy President Robert Rogowsky gave a lecture entitled, “U.S.-China Trade Policy: Productive Collaboration or Managed Rivalry?” Religious studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang began the meeting by giving a summary about what the opening of the Confucius Institute means for the university.</p>\n<p>“We will emphasis academics and research more than most Confucius institutes,” Yang said, “We still will be in the business of educating the public, promoting China studies, strengthening understanding of Chinese history, culture, society, religion, philosophy, literature, economics, and politics.”</p>\n<p>During the lecture Dean discussed the background of Southeast Asia’s cultural history presented his findings from his long-term ethnographic studies focused on Southeast China. According to Dean, ethnic communities with distinct dialects provide cultural benefits to its surrounding region.</p>\n<p>“The dialect communities provide a lot of strength and resources for communities,” Dean said.</p>\n<p>Afterward Rogowsky gave a lecture on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, highlighting economic issues brought about by China’s rapid industrialization.</p>\n<p>“The growth of the middle class in China and in particular Asia is huge,” Rogowsky said. “It’s good but is also somewhat problematic. Problematic in the sense that people in the middle class eat a lot more than people who are poor … so it increases the demand for food tremendously.”</p>\n<p>Vice Director of Confucius Institute Professor Lijuan Zhang ended the meeting with closing statements about the opening of the Confucius Institute and the value of its research.</p>\n<p>“[There is] lots of debate on Chinese issues but there is one consensus that I think everyone would agree,” Zhang said, “that it’s worth the research about China.”</p>\n<p>Second-year religious studies graduate student Sarah Veeck said she was interested in Dean’s analysis on the changes in the Putian plain over the last hundred years.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of depth. There also with the transnational connections continuing to impact local religion in China,” Veeck said. “I would be interested in dong long-term ethnographic study on a community that does rely on local temple associations to provide assistance for education, infrastructure projects, funerals for people who can’t afford them.”</p>\n<p>Yang said Dean offered a historical perspective of Fujian that maintained a locally-oriented account of its regional impact throughout Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>“Professor Rogowsky’s talk had a very powerful global perspective that really serves the global studies academic community here on campus,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the two keynote speeches illustrated the Confucius Institute’s as well as China’s “globally important” role on campus and in the world.</p>\n<p>“It’s a dynamically changing society.” Yang said. “All these global transnational problems, you need China on board. You need to engage with China. Just because you don’t agree on a few things doesn’t mean you cannot include China because China is a dynamic society. It can help the rest of the world a great deal.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60644\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of engr.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>Chemical engineering professor Samir Mitragotri was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) last week, a professional distinction that honors individuals who have made outstanding contributions to engineering research, practice or education.</p>\n<p>One of 67 newly elected members this year and the only faculty member from UCSB, Mitragotri was honored for his work with transdermal drug delivery systems done in part with the Mitragotri group, which he runs in the department of Chemical Engineering. The distinction joins his other honors of being elected to the National Academy of Inventors in 2013 and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he won academy membership because of the advancements he and his research group made in treating patients through medicinal patches on the skin instead of injection with needles.</p>\n<p>“[NAE membership is] really a sort of validation and a culmination of the value of the work that we have been doing,” Mitragotri said. “It’s an encouragement to continue on the same path.”</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Mitragotri is well-deserving of the prestigious election.</p>\n<p>“Election to the Academy by one’s peers is one of the highest recognitions for an engineer, an acknowledgment of outstanding and pioneering research,” Yang said. “This distinction joins a long list of Samir’s other well-deserved honors and accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>Mitragotri said he believes a large part of his recognition is due to the students and research group members who work with him.</p>\n<p>“I really want to thank my students and my research group,” Mitragotri said. “They are the ones who do the hard work on a day-to-day basis, and the work that is recognized is really their doing.”</p>\n<p>With his membership, Mitragotri said he looks forward to conferring with other engineers on making decisions for the future of the engineering field.</p>\n<p>“It’s really an opportunity to participate in the future discussions of engineering at the national level,” Mitragotri said, “That could really be the key benefit and the key outcome of this election.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Zach Sawaya said Mitragotri’s election is unsurprising, given the reputation of the university’s engineering programs.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest, but it makes me very excited,” Sawaya said. “This appointment is simply an indication of the excellent faculty and students … and a reason we have one of the top chemical engineering departments in the country.”</p>\n<p>“Really, it’s representative of UCSB science as a whole,” Sawaya said. “We are a top science university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

According to Harris, the $8,304 funding the BSU received is going toward covering the two-day program and informational documents for parents and students on campus. Harris said the outreach program is the only program that prioritizes African American students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60678\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60678\" data-attachment-id=\"60678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/finance-and-business-committee-hears-from-groups/finance-board-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423457519\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60678\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=334%2C222\" alt=\"Committee members hear students' proposals for funding.
