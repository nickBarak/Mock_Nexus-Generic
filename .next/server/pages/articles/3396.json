Less than a third of a decade after the team was finally recommissioned and ready to compete, the UCSB Hockey team found itself sitting on the first championship victory in program history as a part of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association and proud winners of the ever coveted Adams Cup.</p>\n<p>With such unprecedented success in a token couple of seasons, the question remains: How did this fresh legs Gaucho squad come up so successfully in the playoffs?</p>\n<p>Many teams thrive on veteran leadership from experienced third- and fourth-year players to smooth out a transition for the younger guys. Yet with such an infamous history, or more applicably the lack thereof, this squad saw only eight returners in their championship year. A team made up of 60 percent new members is rarely considered a favorite to win a championship, but the fresh legs on UCSB are unique for a group of first-year competitors.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The freshman presence is significant, but these young men are no strangers to playoff and championship experience. The addition of freshman center Collin del Bonis was crucial to the Gauchos’ success this year.</p>\n<p>Del Bonis thrived in crunch time during high school games as he, accompanied by long-time teammates forward Chris Ewasiuk, defensemen Emmett Rupert and goalie Will Hahn, led the Santa Barbara Royals to back-to-back high school championships in the Los Angeles Kings Hockey League in each of two seasons prior, paving a path for each of them to transition to UCSB hockey. Once the key pieces were initiated at the collegiate level, the team knew success was imminent.</p>\n<p>Imminent, not immediate. It took a couple games for these first-year studs to get their ice legs back on track, but once the team got rolling, boy, did they look like a legitimate threat to make a run for the PCHA title.</p>\n<p>“After the first two or three [games], I was ready to go,” del Bonis said when asked about how his preparation ritual had changed with the transition from high school hockey to collegiate level competition. “We had 12 new guys on the team including me… so we didn’t have any chemistry going into those first two games.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara struggled through the opening two games as new roles were assumed and new rotations were learned. As if it weren’t enough that UCSB was ushering in the majority of a new squad, the Gauchos had a tall task in front of them in Santa Clara University. The Broncos were coming off the 2016 season as runners-up for the Adams Cup and they were on a mission for vengeance.<br>\nOn back-to-back days in the latter half of October, UCSB dropped two losses to Santa Clara by scores of 6-2 and 3-1 to kick off the 2017 season.</p>\n<p>However, rather than being demoralized, these young puck handlers quickly became comfortable in their new roles as chemistry gradually grew within the clubhouse over the next week.</p>\n<p>With a couple games, a hiccup of adversity and a stern week of practice under the squad’s belt, the Gauchos fiercely bounced back with two commanding wins, the first coming with a 4-1 score against Cal Lutheran.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 29, UCSB faced off against Stanford and displayed sheer dominance on the ice while scoring a remarkable 15 goals en route to a shutout of the Cardinals. It seemed fitting that this game took place only a couple of days before Halloween because the Gauchos were starting to look like frightening competitors.</p>\n<p>Much of the success for the quick turnaround was accredited to impeccable leadership from an experienced coaching staff that has handled its fair share of adversity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83138\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1878214632\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83136\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83138\" data-attachment-id=\"83138\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/gauchos-cross-blue-line-with-winningest-season-in-ucsb-history/club-hockey/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=960%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,565\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"club hockey\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=250%2C147&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?fit=888%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83138\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=888%2C523\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"523\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=250%2C147&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/club-hockey.png?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83138\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Ice Hockey at UCSB’s Facebook page</p></div>\n<p>Former Boston Bruin and assistant coach Steve Heinze led the high school squad of Collin del Bonis and the rest of the Santa Barbara Royals to consecutive championships prior to taking a position with UCSB, so not only is he weathered in terms of hockey knowledge, but Coach Heinze also has a history with many of the first-year players which smoothed the transition in collegiate level competition.<br>\n“If we can just approach [games] with a mindset that we’re going to outwork them…you can teach X’s and O’s and pretty plays to anybody, but what I would like to instill with these guys is hard work wins games,” Henize said. When it comes down to crunch times and the postseason, Henize went on to preach rest and care for the body, saying, “we get in shape and then we go and outwork them.”<br>\nThe staunch squad continued to ride their confidence high rolling into the final game of 2017 on a four-game win streak before resuming play once again in 2018 as the team shifted gears to conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB completed the season with seven wins and five losses, a step behind their success in the 2016-2017 season in which they finished 9-6 in UCSB’s first season as a part of the Division II Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association.<br>\nIn contrast to last year, however, the Gauchos broke the seal with a playoff berth in just their second year in the division.<br>\nOver Presidents’ Day weekend, the Gauchos traveled to Lake Tahoe to compete for the Adams Cup and prove their dominance over the West. With a blowout win against Stanford and an outlasting performance against Cal Lutheran, the Ice ‘Chos found themselves matched up with none other than the Santa Clara Broncos, the very team that dropped UCSB in its first two games of the season.<br>\nBut this was a very different Gaucho team than at the beginning of the season. A much more well-rounded and composed squad, the Gauchos have matured and developed immense chemistry throughout the course of the season.<br>\nHeading into the matchup against Santa Clara, the entire roster was feeling confident and poised as they looked the rival Broncos dead in the eye from point-blank range.</p>\n<p>Third-year forward Jackson Schutz assumed a unique leadership role as one of the older players on the team though competing in his first season of hockey with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The skill has always been present on the team. We have the ability to beat Santa Clara,” Schutz said when questioned about the team’s legitimacy come postseason. He went on to praise his squad, saying, “our first two games of the season, we were just getting to know each other… now at the end of the season, we know each other’s styles of play so well.”</p>\n<p>Through the first two periods in the Gauchos championship match up, the team looked to be in complete control as they built onto a 6-1 lead heading into the final period of the season. Yet a strong start didn’t quite get UCSB out of the woods as Santa Clara answered with an unprecedented five goals in the final period as the fate of each of their seasons was left to a mere shootout.</p>\n<p>Leave it to none other than freshman standout Collin del Bonis to finesse the walk-off goal in the extra time to send the Gauchos into the offseason elated with the program’s first hockey championship in only three years of being established.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rode the isthmus of victory down the canal of the Adams cup and ultimately etched their names into the history books.<br>\nWith such a young and talented team to compliment the tremendous coaching leadership, the future for the ‘Chos is looking as bright as ever.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on

But the data it used to function has since become outdated, explained Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that most of the map’s original operators have also since left the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the age of the infrastructure and some complex configuration issues, staff members with skills sets that we previously had, who understood the nuances of the configuration, are no longer here at UCSB,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s grown to a point where we need to staff and license it appropriately.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map began as a joint academic project between the geography department and other data providers on campus to locate lecture halls, classrooms, food establishments and hydration stations as well as parking structures and meters, according to Hall. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the map was opened to the UCSB community in February 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, early stages of its development began in 2008 under the leadership of Dylan Parenti, the information technology manager of the geography department at the time. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Nexus article published in 2013,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the map relies on multiple layers of software which combine to make the map a multifaceted geographical tool.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the map featured interactive tools, including self-guided tours through natural spaces like the Campus Lagoon and lists of the energy consumptions of various buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Estrada, university spokesperson, said that discussions are now ongoing about “the best way to create and maintain tools and resources for navigating the university and real time and helping to ensure the best campus experience for students, faculty, staff and visitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hall and his team await the approval and funding they need to relaunch the map, they are working to improve certain elements of it, such as its access to the Environmental Systems Research Institute and Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System, information databases that provide geographic data, Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the funding comes through, “we’ll be right back at it,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 18, 2020]: This article was corrected to reflect that the university is in current control of the map, not the geography department. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In the other 23 years, USC again has had the most titles with nine after winning six straight titles from 2008-2013. UCLA has the second most with seven, Stanford has five and Cal wraps it up with three.</p>\n<p>With those four squads constantly dominating a water polo conference that held as many as 10 teams a year, it was hard for the Gauchos to embrace being in the middle of the pack time and time again.</p>\n<p>“We always try hard no matter what league we were in,” junior attacker Shane Hauschild said. “But it was a bit deflating not being able to go to the NCAAs just because you couldn’t beat the top two teams [in the country].”</p>\n<p>The frequent finish in the middle of the conference undoubtedly had a discouraging effect after gradually achieving upsets over some of the nation’s top teams each season. To feel like the peak of the season could be to earn a No. 4 seed in the conference tournament, then losing to the No. 1 ranked team in the country after just upsetting the No. 2 seed was demoralizing.</p>\n<p>During many years in the MPSF, teams like Santa Barbara had great seasons that ended all too soon because of one loss. UCSB has had the talent in years to defeat teams like UCLA, which it did back in 2012 during the Southern California Tournament. Before winning against the Bruins, the Gauchos also defeated the Cardinal before ultimately falling to USC in the championship.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, that result alone highlights the issue at hand. At that time, UCSB was ranked No. 6 and defeated No. 3 Stanford, then No. 2 UCLA and was expected to beat No. 1 USC all within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The reality of the matchups were nearly implausible considering that those three aforementioned teams garnered players from other countries that already had Olympic experience on their rosters.</p>\n<p>In comparison to other sports, specifically the current college football season, No. 1 Alabama opened the season against No. 20 USC, which it routed. But the week after they weren’t expected to compete against another top-20 team, let alone a top-five opponent.</p>\n<p>It is deflating to think that the only way UCSB and other schools like Pacific, LBSU, UCI and other middle-of-the-pack teams of the MPSF could make the NCAA tournament is by having to knock off the top three teams in the country first. This is something that isn’t expected in most other collegiate sports, unless it’s in the actual NCAA Tournament, and even then it’s not always the case.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74229\" style=\"width: 426px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74229\" data-attachment-id=\"74229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-refreshing-change-of-scenery-ucsbs-conference-turnaround/tommy-fellner-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-22-16_8-web-1.jpg?fit=2400%2C1590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tommy Fellner passes the ball to a teammate.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>That is why, after 24 years, Santa Barbara men’s water polo and Head Coach Wolf Wigo decided to make the jump and move on to a new conference, one more suitable and one that could give teams such as itself what they desired: a chance to make a run at the NCAA championship.</p>\n<p>The GCC had already established women’s water polo, which UCSB also is a member of dating back to 2013. When the circumstance emerged that many teams were looking for a new home for men’s water polo, the GCC jumped in.</p>\n<p>Moving on, just like UCSB, are Pacific, Long Beach State, UC Irvine, Pepperdine and San Jose State. Each program’s departure left only the big four schools in the MPSF, leading to the conference being in a temporarily troubled state.</p>\n<p>“We lost six of our 10 teams after they were forming a new league in an effort to find an easier path to the NCAA Tournament,” MPSF Commissioner Al Beaird said. “That did put us in a difficult bind since the NCAA requires six teams to have an automatic bid into the championship.”</p>\n<p>In order to help soften the blow, the MPSF announced on June 30 that it was able to find one more team to join the elite four and granted membership to Penn State University Behrend. Getting the fifth team, the MPSF was granted a grace period to retain an automatic qualifier for this year; however, they still will most likely lose that bid come next season.</p>\n<p>“Even if we can get six teams next year, we probably will not be able to qualify for an automatic [bid] because those six teams have to play together for a total of two years,” Beaird said. “We will have to earn our way into the tournament with at-large berths which isn’t the ideal situation, but the quality of the MPSF teams is still strong.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, despite not being able to get an automatic qualifier for the first year, UCSB was happy to be in a conference that feels more evenly matched than stacked against them.</p>\n<p>Earning immediate results, UCSB went out and proved itself in its first year.</p>\n<p>In the inaugural GCC season, the Gauchos ran away with the regular season conference title going a perfect 5-0 after defeating Pacific, LBSU, UCI, Pepperdine and San Jose State.</p>\n<p>The perfect GCC finish was UCSB’s first undefeated conference season since 1979, which coincidentally was the last time Santa Barbara won their first and only Division I NCAA title. Now, the Gauchos hold the No. 1 seed heading into the conference tournament, something they never experienced when they were in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>The newfound confidence in this Gaucho team is evident. They closed out the season winning their final seven games and 10 of the last 11. Influencing the successful finish was not having to face the challenge of playing the top-four nationally ranked talent every single game.</p>\n<p>“Having a legitimate shot of winning the conference, even if you’re a low seed, and getting a shot at the NCAA is huge,” Wigo said. “Any team in the GCC can beat a Pac-12 team, but they can’t typically win three games in a row against them, and starting next year, you win one game and suddenly you’re in the National Championship where anything can happen.”</p>\n<p>And even when they did face top talent this season, UCSB did well. Despite not beating UCLA or Cal, the Gauchos played each game pretty close. Not only that, it did knock off Stanford earlier this year to reach the No. 4 spot in the national rankings, its highest spot since 1990.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s still early and hasn’t been a full calendar year yet, it’s pretty safe to say that the Gauchos made the right decision in making the move out of the MPSF. It was not done out of spite or hate but instead out of what was truly better for UCSB’s program going forward.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t in their best interest for us to leave, but it was in all our best interests, and I think it’s in the best interest of the sport,” Wigo said. “They were a little upset at first, but anyone not in the MPSF would recognize it was a good move.”</p>\n<p>Even though most coaches declined to be interviewed for this piece — most of them due to the fact they were getting ready for the MPSF Tournament this week — it is clear there is still a respect among all the coaches, especially due to the fact they still all scheduled to play each other.</p>\n<p>“We do some joint scheduling and ensured that coaches from both conferences and commissioners like myself maintain those relationships, because having that competition is important to both conferences.” Beaird said.</p>\n<p>Overall, although the move did hurt the MPSF a bit, it is clear that this was the right thing for the Gauchos to do. The confidence that has peaked in this team — as it knows that it can win its conference year in and year out — is apparent especially in seniors who have experienced UCSB’s past before its present state.</p>\n<p>“It’s great that we now have that confidence of going undefeated during season,” senior attacker Mitchell Hamilton said. “And it really helps drive us to win those last two games [conference tournament] and win our division.”</p>\n<p>It is underwhelming to stay in the same middle of the pack each year, never feeling like you are living up to the true potential that lives inside you as it does in every person, every family and every team.</p>\n<p>Like UCSB proved, moving forward and pivoting from that same old structure could make the difference by you not only living up to your potential, but also finding that confidence to be as happy as you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>From a family whose volleyball aspirations brought them to compete at the collegiate level comes the next generation to continue that legacy.</p>\n<p>It took Randy DeWeese plenty of hard work and determination during his journey into the NCAA. Now a key part of the No. 12 team in the nation, DeWeese’s elite showings every game night are a testament to his skill as much as a prime example of why the Gauchos will be in good hands at the setter position for years to come.</p>\n<p>DeWeese is only a sophomore here at UCSB, but with already-impressive stats of a team-high 637 assists and a 7.41 assists-per-set ratio, you might figure him for a seasoned vet at first. Those rankings were also the sixth-best mark in the Big West Conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the starting setter for the Gauchos men’s volleyball team, he is a great role model of how every practice, gym session and game is just another opportunity to improve daily. Although his best volleyball moments are still sure to come, it’s equally fascinating to understand his journey of how he became one of the best setters in the nation for his age.</p>\n<p>“My mom played at the U of A, my uncle at Stanford and the junior national team. So I knew I had it in me,” DeWeese said. “I just had to put in the work and grind it out. That way I was able to figure it all out before I got to college.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in NorCal’s Sacramento area, volleyball had always played a big part in his life. When considering his family’s direct ties to the sport, he really wanted to continue in their footsteps and excel at the same elite level, and that’s exactly what he did.</p>\n<p>Early on, DeWeese received much praise in his time playing club volleyball for Northern California Volleyball Club (NCVC). He earned various accolades for his performances all around the court, such as a spot on the U.S. Junior National Training Team and a feature in <em>Volleyball Magazine</em>’s “Fab 50.” Still, it became very clear that his strongest ability was that of his playmaking expertise at the setter position.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, that tough process of going from club to college began and he started reaching out to some of the best programs in the nation. In the beginning, DeWeese was no stranger to rejection as out-of-state responses didn’t go as planned. Luckily, it was his home state of California who came to the rescue as some of the Big West’s head coaches started to take notice of his true playmaking potential.</p>\n<p>“I started looking pretty early on, around my sophomore year, and that’s when I first found Santa Barbara,” DeWeese said. “I also visited UCI and UCLA, but I just didn’t feel it…UCSB was just so perfect.”</p>\n<p>Just like most other collegiate athletes, this transition to the next level took a toll on DeWeese. Whether it was intense practice sessions or putting in that extra hour in the gym, DeWeese points out that each day is a positional battle for all members of the team.</p>\n<p>“Playing for Santa Barbara was really eye-opening; it showed me just how hard I had to work,” DeWeese said. “Even if the talent is there, you really have to apply yourself, you have to try harder every day. That way you get to where you want to be and achieve whatever you want.”</p>\n<p>DeWeese also points out that everyone on the roster wants to start and that even some of his closest friends are the teammates whom he competes against. Nevertheless, coaches will only start those who are willing to put in the time and effort to deserve that starting position.</p>\n<p>Following an earlier than expected exit from this recent postseason, the Gauchos finished the year with an 11-13 overall record and in fifth place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>Despite that, fans must also realize that No. 12 UCSB was No. 15 in NCAA rankings earlier in the year, showing that they did improve throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Also, the Big West is perhaps the most competitive league since there are a total of four top-10 programs who also participate. Therefore, this was much more than a growing season, it was a preview of just how great UCSB can become over these next few years.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara claimed upset wins against No. 3 UC Irvine, No. 6 BYU, No. 8 CSUN and No. 10 Ball State.</p>\n<p>“Considering we were one of the younger teams in the league, this season went fairly successful. We took a few games against some highly ranked opponents and that caught a lot of people off guard. Just showing what we were capable of was a huge step for us, and we’re going to be that same kind of team next year,” DeWeese said. “I think we’re not far behind at all … We are young, but a big goal for us would be breaking into the top 10 and maintaining that throughout the year.”</p>\n<p>Considering only a quarter of the total team is upperclassmen, UCSB certainly will look to improve their play. Of those four upperclassmen, only one is a senior. Therefore, practically the same familiar squad will be lining up for the Gauchos next year, and UCSB’s star setter has high hopes for the next step of expected progression during this offseason.</p>\n<p>“The way our returning group is progressing has been really fast and we’re learning how to truly play together,” DeWeese said. “And other teams will have to change their dynamic to fit with new players, whereas our starting lineup looks to stay the same next year. So it’s nice knowing that we’ll have that chemistry advantage in next season’s league.”</p>\n<p>As true with any team of any sport, a change in both players and personnel can make or break a team. Luckily for UCSB, this returning group of now experienced players will be able to function together at a higher level.</p>\n<p>However, the fact still remains that the Gauchos compete in the Big West, one of the most competitive volleyball conferences in the entire nation.  Including UCSB, five of the total six league teams in the Big West have been ranked all year long within the top-15 programs in NCAA poll rankings.</p>\n<p>“I think a good goal for us would be staying in the top 10 and maintaining it through the whole year,” said DeWeese when asked about his expectations for the team next season. “When it comes to conference play, taking a third seed or better would be ideal…then winning in the first round of the Big West tournament.”</p>\n<p>Upon first thought, DeWeese’s goal seems very challenging. However, considering UCSB has beaten half of the 12 different teams they played in the top 15 this season, it seems like a very possible feat. With added context, No. 12 UCSB was not ranked within the top 15 at all in the beginning of the year; however, at one point this season they went as high as the 11th-best program in the nation.</p>\n<p>All in all, DeWeese will continue to play a huge part in the game plans of UCSB men’s volleyball, and he only earned his role because of all the years he spent developing his craft. In essentially any competitive scenario, a team is only as good as its leader. In volleyball, players look to their setter for both playmaking production and quality control.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s program is lucky to have a positional leader like DeWeese, and he proves that every game night when he leaves it all out on the court. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 3rd</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82847\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82847\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/","id":3395,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3394,3393,3392],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
