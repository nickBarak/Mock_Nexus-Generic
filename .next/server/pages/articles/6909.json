On Sept. 26, the band famous for “Soul Meets Body” and “I Will Follow You Into The Dark” will grace our own Santa Barbara Bowl along with beach-rock duo Best Coast.</p>\n<p>Originally founded by four Bellingham, Washington men in 1997, Death Cab boasts a long career on the indie/alternative scene with plenty of success. Over the years, the boys have produced eight full-length albums and two EPs, racked up five Grammy nominations, streamed the world’s first live, one-shot music video, earned <em>Billboard</em> gold and platinum certifications, been featured on movie and television soundtracks, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The list goes on and on and, needless to say, this is a group of seasoned musicians.</p>\n<p>Likely, the show will feature much of the material from their latest album, but I predict some of their old hits will make the setlist as well. It wouldn’t be a show for bassist Nick Harmer without bass-centric fan favorite “I Will Possess Your Heart,” and I’ll be damned if frontman Ben Gibbard doesn’t end the show pleading “I need you so much closer” from their <em>Transatlanticism</em> title track, hopefully with some pyrotechnics involved (lookin’ at you, SB Bowl … make the magic happen).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recently, however, the group has become smaller. Chris Walla, guitarist and producer, announced that he would be leaving the band after <em>Kintsugi</em> was finished. Thus, Death Cab will be touring with remaining three original members Gibbard (vocals/guitar/piano), Harmer (bass) and Jason McGerr (drums) along with new recruits exclusively for tour, Dave Depper (guitar/keyboards) and Zac Rae (keyboards/guitar). Although Cabbies everywhere — myself among them — find themselves wondering why anyone would leave a band that created such impeccable angsty anthems, tear-inducing ballads and all-around lyrical and musical genius, I am sure we are all excited to see what the threesome can do without Walla, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>As for the show-openers, Best Coast is sure to set the stage well for Death Cab. Although their lyrics lack in intellectuality, especially in comparison to Gibbard’s poetic verses, the band’s beachy sound will be no stranger to a Santa Barbara crowd. The two-piece consisting of songwriter, guitarist and vocalist Bethany Cosentino and guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Bobb Bruno is famous for their upbeat California-centric songs with just a hint of haunted distortion. Although not a huge fan of Best Coast due to my inability to overlook the distractingly shallow lyrics, the band holds a special place in my heart seeing as Cosentino is the only famous musician to have come out of my high school choir. Personal preferences aside, the pair is sure to hype up the crowd with hits like “Boyfriend,” “The Only Place” and “Our Deal.”</p>\n<p>If you find yourself wanting to escape the crowded and surely alcohol-drenched streets of Isla Vista that first weekend back, snag a seat at the Bowl for what’s sure to be the alternative rock experience of a lifetime. After all, a band whose first release was a cassette tape and yet who continues to be relevant among music-lovers of all ages in 2015 has got to have some serious talent.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/srvcc8izHSU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/","id":6909,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6908,6907,6906],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy","biography":"Not available","articles":[6690,6725,6756,6909,6921,7566],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Outside Lands 2015 Highlights","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Friday, August 7th, over 70,000 music fans flooded Golden Gate Park’s Polo Fields for the eighth annual Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival.

As per protocol, on Saturday evening, modern psychedelic garage giants, The Black Keys, were allotted virtually identical set times on the opposite end of the fairgrounds against, perhaps the most influential rapper of Generation Y, Kendrick Lamar.</p>\n<p>Kendrick rewarded fans that managed to escape the Keys’ bluesy licks with one of his most memorable sets. Lamar devotees could be heard chorusing not only smash hits like, “Backseat Freestyle” and “King Kunta,” but also deeper cuts like <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>’s despondent reflection ballad, “Sing About Me.” The electric enthusiasm remained tangible throughout the performance, with the crowd silencing the hip-hop artist’s speeches on more than one occasion with chants of “Kendrick! Kendrick!”</p>\n<p>Before concluding, Lamar began an accolade of his mentor Dr. Dre that lasted nearly five minutes, which stirred many murmurs of the former NWA member’s onstage appearance in the audience.

The on-stage banter between guitarist Andrew Charles White and bassist Pierce McGarry retained its usual surfer drawl tonality. There was an unshakable feeling that the band didn’t rehearse, but still sounded like they had been born with Fenders in-hand. Longtime Mac DeMarco listeners know that his Saturday afternoon set bore little resemblance to previous shows.</p>\n<p>Mosh pits were nowhere to be found. Mac didn’t take his signature set-concluding crowd surf. Ear-grating guitar solos couldn’t be found. All of this was due to his mini-LP, <em>Another One</em>, a quaint and endearing collection of love songs that DeMarco released on Captured Tracks the day before this performance. And the slow jam feel of this notably breezy concert was a relief. Despite lacking the high energy component DeMarco’s following has come to expect, this live set served as assurance that even though he has new sounds which conjure a very different array of emotions, his songwriting will always bear a stark and enticing sincerity. Also, midway through the set, Mac DeMarco performed an ultra-heavy rendition of Steely Dan’s “Reelin’ in the Years,” as if to remind us that he’s not over shredding.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Booker:</strong></p>\n<p>It’s tough to have enough to say about this guy. When he speaks, he possesses a meek almost squirrel-ish affect. Although Benjamin Booker is merely 26 years old, his singing voice carries the rasp of a sexagenarian whose primary diet consists of two major food groups — bourbon and cheap tobacco.</p>\n<p>Booker and his two bandmates are a recently formed collaboration coming hot off his self-titled first album in mid-2014. They have since earned gigs performing on KEXP Seattle radio, David Letterman and even touring with Jack White. On-stage, Booker is a powerhouse, often straining his voice into exasperated cracks. During covers of Furry Lewis’ “Falling Down Blues” and Otis Redding’s “Shout Bamalama,” the rocker’s ankle’s twisted, unrestrained manner was reminiscent of a young Presley.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the set-closing song, “Have You Seen My Son,” Booker collapsed to his knees to slam the reverb to the highest setting on each amplifier. Booker and bassist Alex Spoto squared off in a jam for nearly five minutes before uttering a barely audible “thanks” and walking off stage with the strings echoing over the P.A.s.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_64460\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/483525312.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1675017367\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64459\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64460\" data-attachment-id=\"64460\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-17/outside-lands-2015-highlights/2015-outside-lands-music-and-arts-festival-sutro-stage-day-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/483525312.jpg?fit=3000%2C1976&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1976\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"FilmMagic\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - AUGUST 09:  Singer Benjamin Booker performs at the Twin Peaks Stage during day 3 of the 2015 Outside Lands Music And Arts Festival at Golden Gate Park on August 9, 2015 in San Francisco, California.

Memorial Sports Arena &amp; Exposition Park for the second time with the most eclectic selection of alternative musical talent. Here are the highlights everyone is talking about.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Kanye West:</strong></div>\n<div>While controversy resulting from Kanye’s gaffes and self-comparisons to political and religious leaders seem to appear at E! News daily, the controversy of West’s replacement of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1995849670\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Saturday</span></span> headliner Frank Ocean was (just this once) not his fault. If Kanye decided to proclaim his greatness for 30 minutes, the gargantuan upset resulting from Ocean’s removal from the lineup may have landed FYF with irreparably damaged reputation. It didn’t.</div>\n<div>The set began with West’s remix of Frank Ocean’s “No Church in the Wild,” in homage to the absent R&amp;B idol. Kanye performed with a certain self-awareness about his position and sensitivity for Ocean fans that Yeezus non-believers would have no reason to believe he was previously capable.</div>\n<div>He had both G.O.O.D. Music protégé Travi$ Scott and pop icon Rihanna make special guest appearances. He didn’t speak, except a few acknowledgments of the crowd and banter with his stage crew.</div>\n<div>When the keyboard line from “Runaway” blared over the speakers, crowd members moaned audibly in fear that West would continue the song for half an hour of the set as he has done in the past.  After a mere 10 minutes, Kanye West said, “I could sing this song for another 40 minutes, but I only got 10 minutes left and 10 years of music left. I got to play my motherf*cking hits.” He proceeded to perform nearly a hit a minute before the stage went dark and the crowd erupted into applause.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>The Jesus and Mary Chain:</strong></div>\n<div>This Scottish alternative post-punk/noise-pop group has had a rocky history. They formed originally in 1983, broke up in 1999 and re-formed in 2007. Lead vocalist Jim Reid wore a simple black and white striped t-shirt under his dark brown 80’s era leather jacket. Despite being well into his fifties, Reid sang with the same spacy and smooth timbre of his 25-year-old self. Reid’s subtle hip perks and slow sidesteps carried a stark Frankie Valli semblance.</div>\n<div>During hits like “Something’s Wrong,” the blue stage lights silhouetted the dust kicked up from the ground, adding to the trance-inducing effect to the labyrinthine guitar rhythms. JMC is one of those bands whose place in rock music carries such clout that there were certainly concert attendees present who purchased FYF wristbands just to see them. A celebrity-sized ego never developed alongside their fame, which became apparent when a soft-voiced Reid thanked the audience after just about every other song.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>D’Angelo and the Vanguard:</strong></div>\n<div>Following its December 2014 release, Black Messiah’s explosive reception has made 2015 the year of D’Angelo. Black Messiah is D’Angelo’s first studio release since 2000, and the subsequent tour is his first since 2012. While the neo-soul singer has been reticent about the reasons for his hiatus, the precision and energy present in the performance prove that he was diligent in his musical endeavors during his disappearance.</div>\n<div>At large music festivals, an astounding majority of concerts feature audience members that are either completely or partially static during any given musical performance. The Vanguard’s performance wasn’t that. Rarely stopping to rest, concert-goers could be seen grinning and side-stepping up to 100 yards back from the stage.</div>\n<div>Technically speaking, the show played like jazz. In terms of feeling, this was funk. The abundance of marbled guitar licks, gospel-inspired harmonies and punctuating horn lines made it easy to imagine the band cramping on a sofa re-watching old James Brown performances.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Death Grips:</strong></div>\n<div>Despite playing the smallest stage, this post-industrial electro-thrash hop group drew one of the largest crowds of any show this weekend. They also drew the largest crowd at that stage all weekend. The entire field that comprised The Trees stage was densely packed with sweaty rage-fueled youth.</div>\n<div>Death Grips disbanded abruptly in July 2014, re-formed in October of the same year and then a released an album soon after. Needless to say, fans have been on a very temperamental rollercoaster ride. FYF was the chance for Death Grips listeners to release their suppressed anger.</div>\n<div>Vocalist MC Ride manically screeched out the words from at least a song from every single album in the Death Grips discography. If you watched the crowd, you wouldn’t think that the fans were even listening. The entire audience formed an ever-shifting, punching, sweaty and dense mass of bodies. Death Grips music isn’t for the weak-hearted, but their almost-cultish control over their following is an undeniable testament of their dark and impressive vision.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Savages:</strong></div>\n<div>When conservative suburban parents have nightmares about their kids falling into the punk-rock scene, their worries are usually misplaced. Most punk bands and clubs are as normal as you and me. Savages are the exception. This all-female, London-based post-punk group is scarier than your first viewing of A Nightmare on Elm Street.</div>\n<div>Their uniform was black leather, black eyeliner and black nails. Their backlights were a ghostly white. Their guitar sounds like the screech of a knife on a window. At FYF, lead singer Jehnny Beth became the reason why the connection between the occult and rock music didn’t die along with Black Sabbath.</div>\n<div>Beth sang Savages mainstay songs like, “Evil” and “Hit Me” in a hypnotic dirge and then broke into sharp snarls without a moment’s notice. During the closing of “Husbands,” Beth shrieked, “If you all stop dancing, we stop playing.” She prepared to step off stage, as fans extended their hands. With her microphone in hand, she walked on top of the palms of front-row fans. “My room, my life, my husbands,” she screamed as she made a coffin on top of the crowd.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"attachment_64577\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64577\" data-attachment-id=\"64577\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/fyf-fest-2015-highlights/fyf-savages-640x472-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,472\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"fyf-savages-640×472-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64577\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?resize=600%2C443\" alt=\"Courtesy of stereogum.com\" width=\"600\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>stereogum.com</em></p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Its gold-moulded proscenium and oversized chandeliers provided a zone for Ratatat to transfigure into a funky discotheque with thumping bass, breakneck guitar licks, heavy synths and spacey lasers.</p>\n<p>Despite having been active for over a decade, the duo of multi-instrumentalist DJ’s (consisting of guitarist Mike Stroud and bassist Evan Mast) are still probably most known for their production of Kid Cudi’s “Pursuit of Happiness.” Over the years, they have created an impressive body of work spanning five LP’s, the latest of which, <em>Magnifique</em>, released earlier this year, ended the band’s five-year hiatus. Although response to the release has been critical of its sonic similarity to their earlier efforts, their older catalogue releases still hold up. While their sound hasn’t dramatically or innovatively metamorphosed since their hiatus, Ratatat has continued to make the music that they want to make, which is evident through the gusto with which they conduct their live act.</p>\n<p>Opening for the night was associative music artist Hot Sugar, a semi-awkward DJ strumming guitar chords over electronic tracks composed of altered found sounds. He chilled on stage in front of M.S. Paint visuals and could’ve benefitted from a live band, but definitely offered a view from a unique corner of today’s drenched electronica scene. And then Ratatat came on stage to unassumingly turn the casual shuffling into a sweat-powered dancehall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Each of their albums was well represented in their set Sunday night, a cross-discography jam session featuring obligatory hits like “Loud Pipes” and “Seventeen Years,” <em>Classics </em>classics like “Lex” and “Wildcat” and the more experimental fare off <em>LP</em>’s <em>3 </em>and <em>4 </em>including “Mirando,” “Neckbrace” and “Grape Juice City.” Stroud and Mast weaved tracks from <em>Magnifique</em> through the set including the title track and singles “Cream on Chrome,” “Abrasive” and “Nightclub Amnesia.”</p>\n<p>After supporting the release with such high-profile gigs as sets at this year’s Coachella, Governor’s Ball and Hard Summer festivals, it was a real treat to watch them whip their sweat-matted locks on a stage like the Majestic. The pair took full advantage of the space’s quaint roominess, connecting with their audience via their raw, fast-paced strumming while dazzling with multi-colored shapeshifting laser displays that danced in sync with their synths, cutting out swirling swaths of dust and smoke. They were flanked by plastic screens upon which were projected images ranging from morphing geometric shapes, to exploding marble Greco-Roman sculptures, to hundreds of cut-and-paste parakeets cocking their heads about to the beat.</p>\n<p>Though this set up seems hodgepodge, it was far from hectic; in their music, Ratatat trims all the fat while performing, presenting an energetic act without excess or clutter. Mast and Stroud pull this off by silencing ego, just two quiet, long-haired, bearded white dudes in T-shirts, anonymous twins pulsing with the cross-pollinated energies of the audience and their own music, allowing their hands and strings to do all the talking.</p>\n<p>Ratatat is a band that celebrates the blending of disparate themes, marrying with their unique sound funk, psych rock, electronica and hip hop; in a performance that itself married the spectacular with the intimate, they allowed the audience in to become members of that groovy equation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7wkRET0hbo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-27/the-brooklyn-based-duo-brings-their-patented-electro-rock-sound-to-the-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-27/the-brooklyn-based-duo-brings-their-patented-electro-rock-sound-to-the-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-27/the-brooklyn-based-duo-brings-their-patented-electro-rock-sound-to-the-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-27/the-brooklyn-based-duo-brings-their-patented-electro-rock-sound-to-the-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-27/the-brooklyn-based-duo-brings-their-patented-electro-rock-sound-to-the-majestic-ventura-theater/","id":6908,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6907,6906,6905],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
