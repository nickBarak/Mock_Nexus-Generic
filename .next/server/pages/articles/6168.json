After some research, we stumbled upon a CalPIRG survey which found that students nationwide spend an average of $900 per year on textbooks. This is almost the equivalent to 20 percent of tuition fees at an average public university and half of tuition fees at a community college. After running our own survey and calculating the 100 responses, we obtained similarly alarming statistics. Our results show that 44 percent of students spent between $600 and $900 a year on textbooks, while 13 percent actually did spend over $900 over the course of the year. The survey also indicated that about 42 percent had not bought the required textbook once or more per quarter because of the cost. There was one encouraging result however — that 80 percent of students had professors who sometimes or often put textbooks “on reserve” (only 3 percent did not know what “on reserve” meant).</p>\n<p>“On reserve” means the professor provides the UCSB library front desk with the required book and allows it to be loaned out for two hours at a time (or overnight, if you check it out just before the reserve desk closes). Not surprisingly, there are students who would find this a hassle. However, putting books on reserve is a practical and crucial alternative for low-income students who have no other option. About 40 percent of our respondents said they were interested in utilizing the service, and 32 percent said they already use books on reserve.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these statistics are not alarming for some of you. We are not suggesting that everyone should start sending hate mail to greedy publishing companies that charge the outrageous prices to begin with (although it would be nice if you did). Ultimately, we are hoping to inform students and professors of the seriousness of the situation and offer possible alternatives. The economic crisis and the fee hikes are no secret. Outrageous rent, increasing tuition, food and other basic needs have forced some students to make the ultimate sacrifice — textbooks and, thus, their education — in order to get by.</p>\n<p>While many professors have indeed worked very hard to accommodate students and offer online copies or other alternatives, the financial stress on students seems to be lost on some professors who refuse to compromise with the very students they are charged with educating. We have therefore proposed an online pledge for professors to put at least one copy of the required textbooks on reserve, suggesting the ideal goal of one book per 50 students in large classes. Some professors have already signed and others have provided useful feedback. Opening the dialogue between students and professors is the first step in finding an agreeable solution for all parties (except the greedy publishers of course).</p>\n<p>Another resource that will be available to UCSB students in the near future is something you probably haven’t heard of yet, but should keep in mind for next year! Sponsored by Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee, the “Book Bank” will help alleviate the financial pressure on students. The Book Bank will be an alternative library for students to check out books they may require for their courses. SIRRC will provide donation boxes in residence halls and other locations such as the Annex building where the SIRRC office is located.</p>\n<p>If you’re left feeling betrayed when you sell your pricey book back for chump change, consider donating to the Book Bank instead! Maybe you would feel better about getting that book off your hands if you knew that instead of going back into the for-profit system, it would go to a student in need. Not only would this make you feel good, but if the time comes when you need to check out a book from the Book Bank, it will be more likely to be there.</p>\n<p>So think wisely, Gauchos, and remember that a united voice from the students is our best chance of success in dealing with overpriced textbooks!</p>\n<p>Onofre Echeverria is a fourth-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet-2/","id":6168,"author":{"id":595,"name":"Onofre Echeverria"},"related":[6167,6166,6165],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":595,"name":"Onofre Echeverria","biography":"Not available","articles":[6166,6168],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Wise Society Seeks to Mitigate Harm, Maximize Benefits","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dennis Wassem’s opinion piece  “Governmental Taxation Undermines Its own Aims” in the Sept. 27, 2011 edition of the Nexus attacked the “narrow worldview” of the “disposition and abilities...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Dennis Wassem’s opinion piece  “Governmental Taxation Undermines Its own Aims” in the Sept. 27, 2011 edition of the Nexus attacked the “narrow worldview” of the “disposition and abilities” of government that was recently advanced by Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren. The article lays two charges against Warren’s argument for more social spending: that the government is not always benevolent and that privatizing public infrastructure and civil institutions maximizes their efficiency.</p>\n<p>The first contention is true but nonetheless a non sequitur. It is uncontestable that the federal government routinely and savagely tortures people, for example. However, criticism of government malfeasance does not imply that it should be inactive. The War on Terror is no excuse to end Medicare. Instead, a wise society seeks to mitigate the harms associated with the government while maximizing the benefits.</p>\n<p>The article’s second argument does directly address Warren’s message and rests on an economic assumption that would have Adam Smith spinning in his grave. It maintains that any service or product that is provided by the government can be more efficiently provided by a private entity. It supports this idea with a sloppy outline of the free market principles found in The Wealth of Nations. Unfortunately, this classic dropped off best sellers lists long ago and very few people actually read it. Many key points are forgotten and neglected when it is applied in modern contexts. Most importantly, Smith argues that decentralization of market power maximizes market efficiency — insulation from government influence is a means to that end, not the goal itself. A free market is not guaranteed by an absence of government regulation but rather by the diffusion of production and consumption over many competing and independent parties. The more complete this diffusion, the closer the market approaches the behavior of Smith’s free markets.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Tuesday’s opinion piece notes, private grade schools and high schools are often higher quality and more efficient than publicly-run equivalents; however, it neglects to mention that for-profit universities charge Ivy League rates for worthless degrees. The deciding difference between these two private education systems, according to Smith’s arguments, is that the former is often administered by small organizations while the latter is controlled by corporate titans. Another open secret in The Wealth of Nations is that Smith does not claim that private profit is always the best way to support the public good. Rather, he maintains that the government should administer such projects that cannot yield profit to any “small number of individuals” but “more than repay it to a great society.” He cites as examples services such as fire fighters and education and infrastructure projects like roads and bridges.</p>\n<p>The truth is that Smith was no ideological zealot though his intellectual corpus is often abused for such zealotry. The modern global economic environment scarcely resembles that of the 18th century and his arguments are often fallaciously extrapolated to support ideas that he vigorously opposed. Smith’s opposition to the concentration of economic power has been cast down the memory hole with the rise of the neoliberal economic order which he surely would have attacked as thinly</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/","id":6165,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6164,6163,6162],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Putting an End to the Textbook Takeover of Your Wallet","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s that time of the quarter again.

Even if you believe those additions are worth the extra cost, I think I can safely say there is a consensus among college students that the textbook industry has been draining our wallets over the years by selling overpriced textbooks and then refusing to buy them back at a fair price.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A group of students from the Political Science Dept. decided to tackle the issue of overpriced textbook costs at UCSB and come up with some answers. After some research, we stumbled upon a CalPIRG survey which found that students nationwide spend an average of $900 per year on textbooks. This is almost the equivalent to 20 percent of tuition fees at an average public university and half of tuition fees at a community college. After running our own survey and calculating the 100 responses, we obtained similarly alarming statistics. Our results show that 44 percent of students spent between $600 and $900 a year on textbooks, while 13 percent actually did spend over $900 over the course of the year. The survey also indicated that about 42 percent had not bought the required textbook once or more per quarter because of the cost. There was one encouraging result however — that 80 percent of students had professors who sometimes or often put textbooks “on reserve” (only 3 percent did not know what “on reserve” meant).</p>\n<p>“On reserve” means the professor provides the UCSB library front desk with the required book and allows it to be loaned out for two hours at a time (or overnight, if you check it out just before the reserve desk closes). Not surprisingly, there are students who would find this a hassle. However, putting books on reserve is a practical and crucial alternative for low-income students who have no other option. About 40 percent of our respondents said they were interested in utilizing the service, and 32 percent said they already use books on reserve.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these statistics are not alarming for some of you. We are not suggesting that everyone should start sending hate mail to greedy publishing companies that charge the outrageous prices to begin with (although it would be nice if you did). Ultimately, we are hoping to inform students and professors of the seriousness of the situation and offer possible alternatives. The economic crisis and the fee hikes are no secret. Outrageous rent, increasing tuition, food and other basic needs have forced some students to make the ultimate sacrifice — textbooks and, thus, their education — in order to get by.</p>\n<p>While many professors have indeed worked very hard to accommodate students and offer online copies or other alternatives, the financial stress on students seems to be lost on some professors who refuse to compromise with the very students they are charged with educating. We have therefore proposed an online pledge for professors to put at least one copy of the required textbooks on reserve, suggesting the ideal goal of one book per 50 students in large classes. Some professors have already signed and others have provided useful feedback. Opening the dialogue between students and professors is the first step in finding an agreeable solution for all parties (except the greedy publishers of course).</p>\n<p>Another resource that will be available to UCSB students in the near future is something you probably haven’t heard of yet, but should keep in mind for next year! Sponsored by Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee, the “Book Bank” will help alleviate the financial pressure on students. The Book Bank will be an alternative library for students to check out books they may require for their courses. SIRRC will provide donation boxes in residence halls and other locations such as the Annex building where the SIRRC office is located.</p>\n<p>If you’re left feeling betrayed when you sell your pricey book back for chump change, consider donating to the Book Bank instead! Maybe you would feel better about getting that book off your hands if you knew that instead of going back into the for-profit system, it would go to a student in need. Not only would this make you feel good, but if the time comes when you need to check out a book from the Book Bank, it will be more likely to be there.</p>\n<p>So think wisely, Gauchos, and remember that a united voice from the students is our best chance of success in dealing with overpriced textbooks!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/","id":6166,"author":{"id":595,"name":"Onofre Echeverria"},"related":[6165,6164,6163],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek Reviews ‘Sorry to Bother You’","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-08-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sorry-to-bother-lead.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sorry-to-bother-lead.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The film itself is anything but stuffy pompous filmmaking –– it breathes with a cartoonish elegance that triggers relieving enthusiasm. “Sorry To Bother You” mimiks the message which its prede...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head down, sleeping in a garage, living paycheck to paycheck: each of these are common narratives in both modern films and television shows. This is also the lifestyle of Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) in the satirical film “Sorry To Bother You.” “Sorry To Bother You”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carries twisted humor through a storyline chronicling sequences that are strange yet familiar in some of the most demented of ways. Director Boots Riley encapsulates his morbid curiosity to capture some of the darkest realities in a playful world of surreal landscapes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Stick to the script” are the four words that Cassius is overwhelmingly commanded to live by in order to best find success in his new telemarketing job for the company Regal View. Those four words are also what lead Cassius to relocate his focuses on gathering material possessions and living a lifestyle that does not comply with the desires of those who have been placed in similar situations through the hierarchy in his environment. In doing so, he learns to evolve his tone into what the film refers to as his “white-voice” and does not shy away from the truth in the matter. Riley also uses this to point toward the capitalistic nature found in companies throughout our nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film itself is anything but stuffy pompous filmmaking –– it breathes with a cartoonish elegance that triggers relieving enthusiasm. “Sorry To Bother You” mimiks the message which its predecessor “Get Out” sets out to evoke within audiences. Riley takes some of the thematic elements which “Get Out” used, and implements them in order to drive the narrative. But, he models the film in a more intense and overwhelming way. For instance, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer), is much like Dean Armitage (aka, crazy dad in “Get Out”), in the sense that both have a similar desire to make use of black males bodies in order to fulfill twisted fantasies. However, Riley takes a quirkier approach and takes a more absurd route in employing a plot twist that creates a bifurcated world, landing the film a spot in the science fiction realm.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

In the aforementioned “Get Out,” he plays a character who is under a demented mind state inflicted by the “sunken place.” In the television show “Atlanta,” created by Donald Glover, Stanfield’s character Darius is constantly spitting words of wisdom and plays his role so effortlessly –– it is clear that Stanfield has proved himself perfect for his latest role. Cassius is conflicted and roams through the movie in revelatory form. His facial expressions are priceless. Stanfield intensifies the physical elements that go into the acting in this film. Throughout the movie so many of the sequences are cartoonish, watching Stanfield fool around in a geekish way completes the films aesthetic. It’s like watching “The Flintstones” and Cassius is Fred Flintstone, scoundering clumsily through everyday life in hopes to just make it to see another morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His counterpart, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), walks around clad in flashy homemade earrings with an Afropunk aesthetic in each one of her outfits. In everything she does, Detroit embodies a bright and artistic demeanor. She even stunts a splendid tee shirt that says “Female Ejaculation Is The Future.” Seeing the way Armie Hammer’s character, Steve Lift, makes a nonsensical agreement with Cassius makes me think to myself, “This is probably what one of those secret conversations between Donald Trump and Kanye West would sound like.” But, I digress. Hammer’s demented portrayal combined with Stanfield’s lithe presence make an engaging sequence in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sorry To Bother You” displays a socially stirring subject matter that aims to send out an important message. In doing this, the film also includes wonderful characters and startling plot loops. Riley’s ability to share a perspective on the world in such a comedic manner with a compelling storyline lands him a wonderful directorial debut. The humor is crude but also, many times, accurate. Quite frankly, if you are offended, you may either be racist or very unaware. Sure, the last 15 minutes of the film are chaotic and slightly rushed, but that is overpowered by what the rest of the film has to offer: a reminder that one person’s fiction may very well be another person’s real life horror story.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/artsweek-reviews-sorry-to-bother-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/artsweek-reviews-sorry-to-bother-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/artsweek-reviews-sorry-to-bother-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/artsweek-reviews-sorry-to-bother-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/artsweek-reviews-sorry-to-bother-you/","id":6167,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6166,6165,6164],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
