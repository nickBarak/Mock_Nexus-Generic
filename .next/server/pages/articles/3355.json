The most recent trip took place over this past winter break and brought students to Texas, according to Alec Valdez, who serves as the alternative breaks co-coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy major, said alternative breaks fit the model of Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) as a whole: serving the local community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point [C.A.B.] came up with the idea of doing a program that went … out of the state of California. It’s a great program because it allows you to go outside of your comfort zone, outside of your culture zone,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B.’s free week-long volunteer trips are held during winter and spring break, and the group also holds a weekend trip during spring quarter. According to Valdez, Community Collaborations International (CCI), a private organization dedicated to setting up alternative break programs, helps C.A.B. set up the trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCI offers different locations and programs, Valdez said, and his job as co-coordinator is to look through the programs and pick which one works best, alongside making efficient use of the funds available — a task that takes all quarter to plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past winter break, the trip’s participants traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to help with the immigrant community there, Valdez said. He explained that this trip wasn’t “the first time we’re doing social justice work as opposed to just disaster relief,” noting that participants traveled to Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The destinations for each trip vary widely, ranging from Florida to Oregon, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/past-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B. website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students applying to be a part of a volunteer trip, however, are kept in the dark regarding the trip’s location — it isn’t until after they have been accepted that participants are told where the trip will be, Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big thing is that curiosity because when we put out the applications, they don’t know where they’re going yet. We leave that until the very end when we pick our final team,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/cab-alternative-break-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative breaks website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each program often gets an average of 200 applicants, but only 10 to 12 students are selected to go on the trip. Valdez emphasized the importance of selecting people who are willing and determined to volunteer, given how the trips are made possible by student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Valdez said that they are currently working on a smaller version of the alternative breaks: alternative weekends that would take students out of Santa Barbara into the wider California community to places such as San Francisco or Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just a vacation trip we’re going on. We’re doing service,” Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure that people who are going on this really value the opportunity and are putting in that effort to see that they really do want to be a part of the team and be a part of the project. We do value effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Valdez, C.A.B.’s work can vary depending on wherever it is needed most. Both Valdez and Cassandra Zhou, a fourth-year psychology and brain sciences major, attended the 2019 spring break trip to Wilmington, North Carolina and helped families rebuild their homes after Hurricane Florence had passed through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working at an animal shelter one day which had been overrun by abandoned and lost animals. They usually serve somewhere around 70 animals or 60 animals in that area. But then after the storm, they had like 150 animals on the property,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhou, the service trip allowed her to expand on her own local volunteering and provide support to people outside of her area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to do a lot of these things where you interact with different communities and you learn how to communicate with them and how to talk to them,” Zhou said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like volunteering gives you more of a purpose. I also typically don’t travel and alternative breaks with an amazing opportunity to travel for free, meet new people and contribute to a community that really needed help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

He shared their annual report with me and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to do this.’ And that’s been my goal from when I started here,” Olowude said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Olowude said C.A.P.S. has been organizing its data — gathered in Excel sheets —  and consolidating it with other universities in the UC system, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of work [in the] unification of our data to make sure that what I’m calling something, someone on another campus is also calling it [the same thing],” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterns revealed in the data collected will allow C.A.P.S. to pinpoint the cause of any dips in the number of visits, Olowude said. The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families.

The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing. I’m very proud of the staff that we’ve been able to compile that work here. And I’m very humbled by and honored by the respect and the support our students have given us,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the January 16, 2018 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

She worked with the Persian Student Group to quickly plan the vigil in only a few days, calling it a “multi-group effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar holds the loss close to her heart as she personally knew victims in the crash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to remember every single life that was lost. It wasn’t just the life — that life had a family, that life had a mom, a dad, a sister, professors, friends,” Abrishamcar told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I myself, my family had a close family friend that passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar wasn’t alone in mourning the loss of someone she knew personally. Farhad Kaimi, a community member at the event, said he attended the vigil to “pay respect for the people who died.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a friend who I knew from middle school and high school. We weren’t close friends but he was on that plane,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature, spoke entirely in Farsi at the vigil. Second-year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gevirtz doctoral student Sepi, who declined to disclose her last name, spoke immediately after Feiz, translating Feiz’s words to English for those who didn’t speak Farsi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are here to pay respect to these victims … as many of you may have heard, a lot of these victims were students and professors, just ordinary people who were visiting family and friends in Iran and never made it back home,” Sepi translated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were kids, newlyweds, whole families, even, who perished,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the vigil, Sepi emphasized the importance of creating an event that is accessible to everyone, regardless of language. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last week, there was a lot of heightened tension, there was a lot of political tension and we are gathering today to honor the lives of innocent victims that were basically as a result of those tensions … I wanted to welcome our non-Iranian friends who gathered with us in solidarity of the lives of the victims who were innocent and who died last week,” Sepi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar echoed this message — that lives lost always need to be remembered, above any political or religious differences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in the climate that we have in Iran right now, it’s very hard to find unity,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has different beliefs and religions and political preferences, but it’s important to have this vigil to remind the people of Iran, in Iran and outside of Iran, that at the end of the day, we are all Iranians and we have to remember these 176 lives that were lost. Their death[s] should not be cluttered with the politics that’s going on right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the vigil, Feiz recited traditional Persian poetry, a cultural custom often performed during times of mourning, according to Abrishamcar, who said there are specific ways to both sing and pronounce the verses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the group joined together in singing the Iranian national anthem, the vigil ended as it began — in the glow of the candlelight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iran is a country of many religions and many cultures. We’re not all Persian, we’re not all Muslim. There’s Jewish people, agnostics, atheists, Baháʼís, Zoroastrian people,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But Persian culture is so different. Persian culture goes back thousands and thousands of years. And that’s what unites all of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Persian Student Group plans to host another vigil mourning the victims on Feb. 18.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
