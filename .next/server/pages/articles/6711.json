The courtyard was bustling, and everywhere I looked couples were decked out in their snazziest vintage attire. Elaborate hats with feathers or lace poked out above the crowd while brightly colored suits and long skirts formed a vibrant sea of fabric. The atmosphere was festive and fun as couples and friends alike took their seats and prepared for a swinging Valentine’s Day throwback experience.</p>\n<p>The stage lit up with a flaming, passionate red, and the musicians of Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) took the stage in their first ever show in Santa Barbara. The group was formed by Scott Bradlee in 2011 and became a YouTube sensation with jazz and swing covers of famous contemporary songs. After their albums and videos became widespread hits, they began touring with various musicians, singers and dancers while keeping true to the origins of their music.</p>\n<p>During the show, Bradlee told the audience, “A lot of you have followed us from the old days when I was recording videos in my basement … so this was always a grassroots thing. Thanks to you and your shares and views, PMJ has now toured four continents.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The show’s emcee, Mario Jose, hyped the crowd up with a loud, bright voice and some old fashioned jokes before the first number.<br>\nWith a suave tone, he announced, “We’re taking you on a journey back in time tonight, when social media actually meant shaking hands with someone and swiping tinder was something you did by the fireplace in the winter.”</p>\n<p>As the crowd laughed with him, a jazzy rendition of “Call Me Maybe” began to play, adding to the lighthearted mood. The arrangement was reminiscent of 1920s New Orleans swing with heavy banjo and a quick beat. Robyn Adele Anderson performed the song with a soaring belt and a sparkling flapper dress to match the time period.</p>\n<p>Dani Armstrong dominated the stage next with a vibrant red dress and unwavering confidence as she sauntered to the microphone. Her rendition of Britney Spears’s “Toxic” was sultry and captivating, with a slow, pounding beat and an intense mixture of loud and soft moments. The red-headed singer hit sky high notes that filled the theatre with a vintage-style vibrato. The slight raspy quality of her voice on the low notes and occasional grinding vocals completed the seductive tone of the song.</p>\n<p>Jose said it best when after Armstrong’s performance, he commented, “Anyone else need a smoke after that?”</p>\n<p>In the style of old fashioned floorshows, Casey Abrams introduced himself with flair by theatrically balancing his guitar on his hand, feigning like he was going to drop it with a wide-eyed expression. At one point, just to ham it up even more, he pulled out a bottle and took a sip, all while maintaining his balance. His dazzling talent did not stop there, however, as his vocal performances exuded fun and spontaneity. His bluesy cover of “Sweet Child O’ Mine” demonstrated his strong, raspy voice, and his interaction with the other musicians kept the audience laughing and cheering. He even engaged in a vocal battle with trombone player James Hall; Abrams scatted a musical phrase and Hall mimicked him with blasts from the trombone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75910\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983708497\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75909\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75910\" data-attachment-id=\"75910\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/pmj-promo-2-12-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=2048%2C1337&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1337\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"PMJ PROMO 2-12-14\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?fit=888%2C580&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75910\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14-250x163.jpg?resize=250%2C163\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=768%2C501&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=1024%2C669&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMJ-PROMO-2-12-14.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harbison Theater</p></div>\n<p>One musical battle was not enough for this show, however, as tap dancer Anise Aliah faced off against drummer Martin Dillard. The dancer’s vibrant energy shone as she kept her wide smile even through the most complex of steps. This wasn’t enough for Dillard, however, as he stopped the upbeat music and began to copy Aliah’s rhythm with his drumsticks, flipping them in the air and catching them with style. Each performer took turns attempting to best each other with impossibly fast beats. Aliah clearly won the crowd, however, as her fast turns, high kicks and relentless wing steps drove the audience wild with applause.</p>\n<p>The evening was a true homage to the days of variety shows and spectacles of performance with one audience-grabbing, fun-loving segment after another. The musicians, dancers and vocalists captured the essence of classic jazz with spontaneity, smoothness and constant collaboration with their fellow performers. The show was meant for Valentine’s Day, as it demonstrated both the group’s and audience’s love of jazz and the swanky style of earlier times.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/postmodern-jukebox-brings-charm-to-arlington/","id":6711,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6710,6709,6708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon","biography":"Not available","articles":[5877,5893,6526,6694,6711,6731,6748,6795,6815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Friday Review: Process by Sampha","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1bb558bcd5.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1bb558bcd5.png?resize=886%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sampha has been featured in tracks by Kanye, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Drake, yet hadn’t released a full debut album of his own until this week’s Process. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although you may not recognize his name, Sampha is a voice you’ve likely heard before. The singer, songwriter and producer from South London has had his hands in many of the best R&amp;B, neo soul and electronic records of the past few years. He co-produced four songs on Pitchfork’s top album of 2016, Solange’s spectacular record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and lends his vocals to one of the top singles from that album, “Don’t Touch My Hair.” He’s worked heavily with British DJ and Young Turks label-mate SBTRKT. He’s been featured in tracks by Kanye, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Drake, yet hadn’t released a full debut album of his own until this week’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When a new artist like Sampha gains the respect of so many talented and influential musicians before they’ve even put out a debut album, it’s good to pay attention to their solo work ,and I’m glad I did with his new project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sampha states in the heartfelt ballad about his childhood, “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” he has “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something some people call a soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” His vocals aren’t perfect and clean, but they carry tremendous emotion. His voice is like a beautiful, passionate mixture of James Blake, Frank Ocean and Leon Bridges, and he’s already learned how to compliment it well with the instrumentation on his debut LP. On “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” one of the lead singles of the project which Sampha dedicates to his mother, he strips back the instrumentation and creates an amazing back-and-forth between himself and the piano that make you believe him when he says, “No one knows me like the piano in my mother’s home.” The listener can feel the true demand he feels for self-expression. That amount of soulfulness is special, and Sampha has it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hear that soulfulness again when he sings of the ways he blamed a past lover for his own underlying problems in “Reverse Faults,” using the metaphor of taking the breaks out of his own car, getting into an accident and blaming the other person in the relationship even though it was his own doing. You hear it when in “Timmy’s Prayer,” perhaps singing about this same ex, he laments that, “I got thrown out / I don’t know which way to go now / Don’t know which way is home now.” Not only is his vocal delivery powerful, but Sampha also does an incredible job of painting a picture with his lyrics. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His lyrical imagery is most notable on what is perhaps the best song on the album, “Blood on Me.” The most upbeat and exciting track on the record, “Blood on Me” features evocative images of a tortured dreamscape where Sampha is running away from his inner demons and fears. Throughout the track, the singer is out of breath and the repetition of the intro throughout the runtime of the song creates a dreadful, anxious chase scene in the listener’s mind. He has said in an interview with Genius that this track came about from improvising on the piano after watching the critically-acclaimed anime film</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ghost in the Shell</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the influence is obvious, as the emotion of a cold world filled with enemies around every corner really comes across in the delivery of this track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might lob the same criticisms on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that many initially did on Solange’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Seat at the Table</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which Sampha worked heavily on. They might say that it’s too low-key, especially within the deeper cuts of the record. However, his style of electronic-infused soul is not as laid back as it would first seem and has a lot of depth to it that rewards multiple listens, especially once you dig deeper into lyrics. Not every single song is a complete hit, but that’s to be expected with a debut record. Still, every song on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showcases the unique artistry Sampha brings to the table. In the end, what we are left with is one of the best soul debuts of the past few years and perhaps the best album of the year so far.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/the-friday-review-process-by-sampha/","id":6708,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6707,6706,6705],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yuja Wang and Company Take Granada By Storm","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Granada was ablaze with fervent virtuosity this week as Yuja Wang and Leonidas Kavakos filled the theatre for a night of intensity and longing on Monday, Feb. 13. Wang, whom the San Francisco Chronicle called “the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today,” alongside Kavakos, whose violin talents recently secured him the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, performed pieces by Janácek, Schubert, Debussy and Bartok as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series.</p>\n<p>Wang took to the stage in a resplendent glow, sporting four-inch stilettos and a tight, elegant dress that looked as if it were made of nothing but smoke and gold leaf. She has built up quite the reputation for stylish-yet-risqué outfits that allegedly get under some critics’ skin but simply lead me to think of her as the Rihanna of the concert piano world.  Kavakos, in sharp contrast, emerged solemn and subdued in a button-down and slacks. He would have fit just as well in a Silicon Valley startup office as on the stage, and this contrast foreshadowed the dynamic and complex ways the duo’s musical styles would interact throughout the night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75764\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"37285325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75763\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75764\" data-attachment-id=\"75764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/yuja-wang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Yuja Wang\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of PBS&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75764\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of PBS</p></div>\n<p>A violin sonata by Janácek started off the night, the technical difficulty of the piece immediately casting light on both Kavakos’s and Wang’s brute-force musical talent. However, the two seemed a bit tense during the first couple movements, and this rigidity meshed poorly with the already dissonant nature of Janácek’s piece. Luckily, by the third and fourth movements, they had settled into their respective grooves for the sonata’s triumphant yet melancholy climax.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Schubert’s “Fantasie in C Minor” followed, providing a welcome reprieve from the tension of the previous piece. The audience’s hopes soared alongside Kavakos’s nimble bow as he weaved a verdant tapestry of sound and light in the Granada’s expanse. Wang’s nimble fingers supplied the backdrop to the magical expanse, the Middle Earth to Kavakos’s quest for the ring, as it were. Afterward there was a short intermission, at which I overheard one patron remarking that, “this theater is run by a bunch of extortionists, I mean can you believe it, $9 for a glass of unremarkable chardonnay? They’re just playing off of people’s insecurities about talking to strangers at intermissions, like of course we’re going to get a drink, what choice do we have?” The disgruntled man wished to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p>The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress. She must have transmuted some of her visual pizazz into musical zeal, as her performance on Debussy’s “Sonata in G Minor” elicited gasps and murmurs from the audience. As she squeezed every last drop of emotion from the Steinway’s lower register, I was shaken by vibrations in my liver itself. Or maybe another organ close to the liver.</p>\n<p>Kavakos and Wang polished off the night with Bartok’s “Sonata No.1 in C# Minor,” a piece that would no doubt make any but the most accomplished of performers quake in their loafers. This sonic rollercoaster bore some resemblance to the Janácek piece from earlier in the night, but where the former felt constricted and claustrophobic, the duo’s nightcap exploded in a cacophony of unrestrained chaos and energy. Drowsing patrons could be seen jerking upright in their seats at the stab of a minor chord or the wail of Kavakos’s strings. The intensity continued to build and build before releasing itself in ecstatic, frenetic climax leaving both performers and audience awake, gasping and perhaps a little sweaty. At one point, I began to suspect that Yuja Wang doesn’t have hands at all, and instead performs with a pair of motion-blurs on the ends of her arms like electrons whipping around inside valence shells. Although it’s not their first performance on the Arts &amp; Lectures circuit, it’s safe to say that Wang and Kavakos will not soon be forgotten by the Santa Barbara concert scene.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/","id":6709,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6708,6707,6706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Grammys Pay Tribute to Past and Present","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=900%2C506&ssl=1","description":"No matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2017 Grammy Awards were a glimpse back at legends lost and a look forward to the young artists ready to dominate the music scene in years to come.</p>\n<p>Bruno Mars played Prince’s twin, paying tribute to the king of funk.

Vulnerable, she stopped short after opening with “Fastlove” in her tribute to the esteemed pop icon. She asked to “restart” the song from the top saying, “I can’t mess this up for him.” She shares an emotional connection to Michael because of their mutual London roots. It was quite a night for the pop songstress herself. The powerhouse singer simply dominated, bringing home five Grammys for her third studio album, 25, in the show’s most sought-after categories: Song, Record and Album of the Year. The British songstress performed “Hello” in a geometric red and black dress with an accordion skirt, channeling her classic look with a new twist.  The nostalgia in the room was uncanny, with the singer gushing, “The last time I was here was five years ago, and I was pregnant … I lost a lot of myself being a mother … it seems like I’ve gone full circle.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Throughout her five wins, Adele decided to share her successes with an idol of hers, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>“I adore you, and I want you to be my mommy,” she exclaimed to Queen Bey. “The Lemonade album was so monumental … We got to see another side of you … We, as artists, adore you … You are our light.” Beyoncé stopped the show with her breathtaking performance centered around her latest studio album, Lemonade. Although she chose to perform less popular tracks, including “Love Drought,” and “Sandcastles,” she successfully won over the crowd. Even while pregnant with twins, she still owned it. Bey’s royalty radiated through her goddess-like costume.</p>\n<p>The messages she instilled in us will stay: “Your mother is a woman, and women like her cannot be contained.” Queen Bey’s performance will go down in Grammys history.</p>\n<p>Although there was no specific tribute dedicated to David Bowie, he won Best Rock Song with “Blackstar,” the title track from his 25th and final studio album, which was released on his 69th birthday.</p>\n<p>Best New Artist recipient Chance the Rapper also took the night by storm.</p>\n<p>“I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” he exclaimed. “I know that people think independence means you do things by yourself, but independence means freedom.”</p>\n<p>He referenced SoundCloud and “all the independent artists out there” throughout his speech and encouraged the audience to continue in their endeavors, big or small. Chance started as an independent artist himself with his first mixtape, 10 Day, and since then, he has made significant strides in the music world, winning his first Grammy with Coloring Book. His success shows that no matter how small an artist starts, they can reach the height of their craft.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75760\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"859788678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75756\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75760\" data-attachment-id=\"75760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?fit=888%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75760\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85-250x141.jpg?resize=250%2C141\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-634981490_wide-1726f538fc06f5f349be603504ae3e7343b48332-s900-c85.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of NPR</p></div>\n<p>After taking a break from the public since her father’s death in 2009, Paris Jackson finally made an appearance, presenting The Weeknd and Daft Punk. The trio began with a medley of “Starboy” that led into “I Feel It Coming.” The collaboration gave rise to an unusual yet intriguing set that channeled Hoth from “Star Wars.”</p>\n<p>New York DJ duo Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, also known as the Chainsmokers, rocked the charts this past year. Tracks such as “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Closer” and “Roses” blasted through speakers on repeat, whether at a raging party, the gym or car radios. It’s no wonder that they won their first ever Grammy Award this year alongside Daya. Although Rihanna turned them down to be featured in the Grammy winning single, “Don’t Let Me Down,” they still seemed to reach success in the viral department.</p>\n<p>Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots were definitely not “stressed out” about receiving their award for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” in nothing but their underpants.</p>\n<p>“Josh turned to me … and he said, ‘If we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this,’” Joseph said.</p>\n<p>Ed Sheeran was loving our bodies, and we are loving his Grammy performance right back. Although he was a last-minute addition to the set list, he did not disappoint. Sheeran centered his performance around his latest single, “Shape of You.” He decided to play it casual and performed the song with nothing more than his acoustic guitar. His manner seemed like he was performing for a few of his closest friends, yet millions were watching all over the world. His all-black outfit — including a “HOAX” T-shirt, black jeans and kicks — contributed to the affinity of his performance.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native Katy Perry took the stage with a new and improved look. With short blonde locks that frame her face and a new wardrobe, she surprised the audience as platinum Perry. She really was trapped in her “white picket fence” as she took the stage on a set emulating her opening line to her new hit single, “Chained To The Rhythm.” Perry came barreling out in a white, black-lined pantsuit and John Lennon-esque rose-colored glasses and white sneakers. She walked through blue and white clouds and turned the corner to find Skip Marley, grandson of Jamaican legend Bob Marley. The younger Marley channeled his grandfather’s eclectic reggae sound and wore a white army jacket and pants. Perry topped her performance off with an iconic “We the People” backdrop.</p>\n<p>In a night with no shortage of political statements, Donald Trump was criticized by a number of performers. Neil Portnow, record producer and president of the Recording Academy, took a different approach, calling out to Washington to keep American music alive.</p>\n<p>After quoting John F. Kennedy, he remarked, “The Recording Academy together with the music-makers call on the President and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.” Portnow concluded, “We have a collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique,  economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/grammys-pay-tribute-to-past-and-present/","id":6710,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6709,6708,6707],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
