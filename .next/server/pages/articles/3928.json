The Cachuma Reservoir received only 42 percent of the typical amount, and Santa Barbara County altogether received 25 percent of normal rainfall.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreased rainfall, the report showed impacts on water quality in the reservoir due to the fires.

The Gibraltar Reservoir received 133 percent of the expected amount of rainfall, and the Cachuma Reservoir received 147 percent of normal rainfall. Santa Barbara County received 163 percent of typical rainfall for that time of year.</p>\n<p>Dyer explained that when the Cachuma Reservoir stops spilling is when it is clear that Santa Barbara County is entering a drought. A reservoir “spills” when it has reached higher than 100 percent capacity, so the excess water goes through a spillway connecting to the local creeks and waterways.</p>\n<p>She said that the last time

Ross Trindle, general counsel for the CSD, said at the board’s Sept. 12 meeting that the court’s decision in the California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland case could create a pathway to a new tax for Isla Vistans if the board decides to act as the ruling seems to suggest.</p>\n<p>The court decision suggests that the board will have the option to bring the tax to a special election or vote on it directly at a board meeting if 10 percent of voters bring signatures supporting an ordinance proposing a tax to the county.</p>\n<p>If the board chooses to pass the tax directly at a board meeting, voters will be stripped of their power to vote. In November 2016, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locals shot down the tax</a> when Measure F received less than a two-thirds majority of the vote.</p>\n<p>A special election is a vote that could be called immediately, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>The ordinance voters would create is subject to the county’s approval and must outline the exact ways in which the tax would be collected and how the funds would be spent.</p>\n<p>Trindle said his interpretation of the court ruling was widely debated by legal scholars and that it is currently unclear whether the board would be able to take this option. He suggested the board focus on the issue in the “user utility tax ballot measure ad-hoc committee” created to work on putting the tax on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“I throw this out there because there is a very large question that is unresolved,” Trindle said. “There are legal scholars, colleagues on one side, that say the issue is very narrow… and there are media accounts and experts on the other side that say, ‘No that’s absolutely thrown into question.’”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> contacted the offices of Supervisor Joan Hartmann, the District Attorney and the County of Santa Barbara’s legal counsel for comment on the legality of Trindle’s interpretation of the court ruling.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, none have responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an organization that helped amend the state constitution to require a two-thirds majority to pass a tax, was “very disappointed” with the court’s ruling because it could be interpreted as a way to circumvent the supermajority necessary to pass a tax.</p>\n<p>“They’ve specifically come out and commented that this would allow for ‘collusion’ between governments and special interest groups to effectively back-door taxes through this lower-level of scrutiny process,” Trindle said.</p>\n<p>In an interview last month, board chair Ethan Bertrand told the<em> Nexus</em> there were plans to put the tax on the ballot in June or November of 2018 and said he was confident it would pass.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78801\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78801\" data-attachment-id=\"78801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-21/new-tax-for-csd-could-bypass-voters/csd-new-tax-by-william-tracy-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD NEW TAX BY WILLIAM TRACY-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78801\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CSD-NEW-TAX-BY-WILLIAM-TRACY-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>William Tracy / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Trindle’s comments at the end of the Sept. 12 meeting, however, present the board an opportunity to essentially bypass voters and create the tax through a simple majority at a board meeting.</p>\n<p>Voters last attempted to pass a tax in I.V. in November 2016, when it created the CSD through Measure E. Measures E and F were broadly campaigned to be voted on jointly, with E establishing the district and F funding it through a tax on the use of utilities in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Pressure slowly mounts on the CSD as it could be terminated if it fails to pass a tax. The bill that created the I.V. CSD, Assembly Bill 3, says “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>I.V. lawmakers will be weighing the decision to create the tax independent of most voters’ input or to bring the issue to the public. Some board members have spoken out against the move.</p>\n<p>Speaking on the subject, which was not on the meeting’s agenda, Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said at the meeting that voting directly on a tax through the board would give the public a perception that was “sketchy.”</p>\n<p>“If we’re as concerned as we are with transparency and due process, this is a novel approach,” Hedges said before being reminded by Director Jay Freeman that he was not legally allowed to speak on the subject.</p>\n<p>The Ralph M. Brown Act limits board conversations to the subjects on the agenda posted to the public.</p>\n<p>In a text message to a reporter, Freeman said he opposed bringing the tax to a vote of the board and called the possibility of using this new court ruling a “legal hack.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that if we are to raise a tax we should use the process people expect,” Freeman said. “Tax measures should go to the voters.”</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop. Agenda and other meeting materials can be found at <em>islavistacsd.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Language in this article was changed to make clearer it is not certain whether the court’s ruling allows for this method of creating a tax, but does not rule out the possibility. Trindle was also previously misquoted as saying the CSD should create a new ad-hoc committee, while he actually said the board should take the issue to an existing ad-hoc committee, the UUT Ballot Measure Ad-Hoc Committee.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor race, Bruce Porter, held an early lead in the voting booths, while news sources were reporting that the country’s new president would be inheriting a politically fractured nation.</p>\n<p>Democrats everywhere felt the sobering start of a new era with President Donald Trump’s election later that night, but Hartmann was supposed to be celebrating a milestone in her public service career — <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\">her appointment as a county supervisor</a>.</p>\n<p>Hartmann and Gina Fischer, a highly-involved staff member in Hartmann’s Isla Vista projects and representative for the Third District office, agree that the night of the election was a somber time. In response, Fischer said some constituents turned to Hartmann and local government to ease their dissatisfaction with national politics.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said the fact that her election coincided with Trump’s placed an additional responsibility on her office to listen to constituents and bring people together rather than divide them.</p>\n<p>Constituents from I.V. and UC Santa Barbara in particular would be expecting focused representation for their communities from Hartmann. When those precincts were counted, Hartmann’s votes took a significant jump.</p>\n<p>In return for their votes, Hartmann has had a busy and effective year working on I.V. infrastructure, public safety and support for the I.V. Community Services District, which has benefitted from donations from Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>She has worked to get the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) off the ground, giving the newly-formed government start-up funds, leasing them the previous Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr’s office and giving them a space to provide programs in the community room of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Because a large number of the county’s residents live in unincorporated areas, it is Hartmann’s responsibility to represent those constituents, making I.V.’s self-determination through the CSD even more important.</p>\n<p>“I am always scampering around from Guadalupe to Vandenberg Village to Los Alamos to Solvang to I.V. to here in Santa Barbara. So now I.V. has its own government, and to see that begin to take shape is really exciting,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Fischer said Hartmann’s office is interested in “culturing conditions for [the] CSD to grow,” giving the new government an opportunity to represent its constituents in a way that might previously have been more difficult through the county.</p>\n<p>“We’re watching something very exciting be born and I’m delighted to be one of the midwives of many for that process,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Board Chair Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday he’s had “nothing but good experiences” working with Hartman and her staff, saying she has always been attentive and willing to help constituents.</p>\n<p>“Without Supervisor Hartmann’s early support, we wouldn’t have been able to begin providing services so quickly,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office contributed $3,000 from their discretionary funds in the last fiscal year and $2,000 in the current year, he said, which has helped the district in their start-up costs.</p>\n<p>Since its creation, the I.V. CSD has created an internship program in collaboration with UCSB’s Department of Political Science, managed scheduling for the community room and launched an expansion of the Community Service Organization’s escort program.</p>\n<p>The District has also developed a policy manual, hired legal counsel and acquired insurance, fulfilling critical steps in its formation.</p>\n<p>Bertrand expressed praise for Hartmann’s work in I.V. and said that the county’s infrastructure improvements have been especially helpful for her constituents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/\">The county Public Works Department installed a stoplight in August</a> at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte, citing a need to mitigate the amounts of collisions in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/where-the-sidewalk-ends-soon-to-be-6700-sabado/\">The county also installed a sidewalk</a> on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road last spring.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said Hartmann’s work on public safety issues through the I.V. Safe task force has helped people better understand the issues they are facing in the community through her focus on the data involved in these subjects.</p>\n<p>Hartmann said her office’s number one priority is to keep students safe and said she was pleased that this year’s Halloween weekend saw fewer arrests and medical transports.</p>\n<p>While Hartmann has focused on helping her constituents by attempting to support I.V.’s bid for self-governance through the CSD, a main focus of hers going forward will be helping the Community Center become a source for community programming for her diverse constituency.</p>\n<p>“We got a grant for $460,000 to add to money that the county had already invested in the community center, and then we had to delay opening the community center,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We expect to bring everybody in Isla Vista from different age groups, different ethnicities, different — not everyone will be students — and hope that we can create a stronger sense of belonging to the I.V. community,” she said.</p>\n<p>She said she also hopes to soon build a “pipeline” between UCSB and the county to bring students into the county.</p>\n<p>Despite what she said was a “steep learning curve” to the first year of her term, Hartmann said the work has been fun, and she has built connections with I.V. officials like Bertrand who have said working with her is a “true pleasure.”</p>\n<p>Constituents will continue to look for strong leadership in Hartmann and other local elected officials, as students and I.V. residents have shown that they are resistant to the changes occurring on the national level.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Wang</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came to speak at the Arlington Theatre last Thursday, discussing domestic politics, Donald Trump and modern rights movements.</p>\n<p>Rice is a controversial figure due to her role in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq while working under the Bush administration. Critics accuse her of advocating for the war, despite doubts about the credibility of the intelligence regarding the building of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>\n<p>This dissension caused the debut of a protest group called the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective.<br>\nMembers of the newly formed organization greeted attendees with chants such as “Lock her up” and “Arrest the war criminal.”</p>\n<p>While Rice avoided the topic of the demonstrators, she made an effort to justify her decisions in the 2003 invasion.</p>\n<p>Rice explained that Iraq was difficult to predict. As the National Security Advisor at the time, she believed that data concluded that Saddam Hussein was working toward weapons of mass destruction.<br>\nThough the invasion showed this presumption was incorrect, Rice felt she had reacted appropriately under the precarious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Despite this argument, demonstrators continued to voice their disapproval.</p>\n<p>“I’m upset that they’re bringing in Condi Rice to speak at UCSB as if she was a legitimate authority on anything,” Howard Winant, UCSB professor of sociology, said. “She used her academic credentials to manipulate and murder and torture and commit war crimes.”</p>\n<p>Cara Yoshizumi, one of the founders of the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective, protested due to a more general anti-war sentiment.</p>\n<p>“So much of our country’s resources go into war and killing and environmental destruction,” Yoshizumi said. “The U.S. is an advanced and rich country, and yet we don’t have things like free education and free health care, like most advanced countries do. All of that is because of misplaced priorities, like the war in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Some of the audience attended not in support, but instead to critique and gain perspective on Rice.<br>\n“We are not here in support of her, we just want an abstract of what she’s about,” audience member Jeff Smith said.</p>\n<p>“She was definitely a part of it… she’s guilty,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Inside, Rice talked identity politics, criticizing Donald Trump’s “America First” slogan.<br>\nShe contested that a “confident country” is focused on an international level of “larger good,” not just the success of Americans. Rice defined this as spreading democracy and balancing trade.</p>\n<p>In her Q&amp;A session, Rice voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but referred to kneeling for the National Anthem as divisive symbolism.</p>\n<p>The self-proclaimed feminist also criticized the #MeToo movement. She said that though she overall supported and praised the purpose it served, she warned against oversensitivity of followers.</p>\n<p>Rice voiced concern that young women wouldn’t be equipped for the real world, stating she hoped the movement didn’t teach that “women can’t take care of themselves, because they can.”</p>\n<p>On immigration policy, Rice took a positive approach, stating, “immigration has been the lifeblood of this country.”</p>\n<p>Rice reproached Trump’s decision to build a wall between the Mexico and United States border, stating that “a wall doesn’t have to be a physical thing.”</p>\n<p>She backed this argument by claiming that net immigration from Mexico is zero. Rice said that Central America is the source of criminal immigrants, making the wall ineffective.</p>\n<p>Though Rice called the past year’s number of 40,000 refugees under the Trump administration lacking, she did suggest capping the number at 70,000.</p>\n<p>She broke down the modern system for integrating immigrants through private charities. She explained that a number above 70,000 would be too strenuous on the system, potentially causing it to collapse.</p>\n<p>Despite protests and critics, a large number of attendees showed support for Rice by reflecting on her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“Her education, she was a pianist, she was considered to be a position in the football commission, and she’s a woman… this shows she’s a well-rounded leadership type,” Santa Barbara resident Grace Johnson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80762\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80762\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/","id":3927,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[3926,3925,3924],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
