On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.

However, personnel managers were adamant that students follow dining hall protocol and not remove food from Ortega, leading to a brief confrontation with activists and students leaving with to-go plates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as lines for food got longer and began to stretch around the building, organizers continued to encourage students to take food to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to occupy Ortega was made to show how the UC “functions as a business rather than a school,” according to the COLA press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By liberating this dining commons, we draw attention to how food insecurity functions daily on our campus, keeping us from being the students, teachers, and mentors we want to be. While graduate students are currently on a wildcat strike, this action demonstrates that our movement is not only dedicated to achieving fair pay but also to changing the priorities of the public university system to better fit the needs of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> students,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the statement continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most students who entered the building seemed to support the graduate students’ actions. One student, Kayla Katsuda, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, noted that she came for the free lunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends told me about what was going on, and I came because I don’t have a meal plan,” Katsuda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student and Ortega Dining Commons employee explained to the Nexus that he “didn’t know what was going on” at first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They seemed to be letting all people in, and the food is overpriced, so I would agree with that. You could easily go to Isla Vista and get a better meal … so I agree [with the strikes].

Thursday’s action marked one </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since UCSB graduate students began striking. COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
