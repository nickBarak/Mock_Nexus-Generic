CSD voted in its newest member during Tuesday night’s meeting. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nguyen is the first woman of color to serve on the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</p>\n<p>After an hour and a half of candidate interviews, public comment and board discussion, the board of directors selected Nguyen to the position due to her experience with university and community organizations and her diverse perspective.</p>\n<p>“Being able to have a board that looks like the community and especially women and women of color is really something that strikes me as [having] paramount importance,” I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said at the meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>Nguyen was chosen over Jeremy Levine, a UCSB fourth-year economics and statistical double major, the only other applicant out of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/three-candidates-emerge-for-i-v-csd-vacant-seat/\">initial four who applied</a>. Two of the initial applicants, Jeremy Roark and Lindsay Sherman, dropped out of the running by the start of the CSD’s meeting on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Nguyen received strong support from board president Spencer Brandt and board directors Ethan Bertrand and Robert Geis. All three cited Nguyen’s racial and gender diversity, compared to the previously all-male board, as factors in their decision, along with her experience campaigning for Measure R and her publicity experience in Alpha Delta Pi and Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>“It’s incumbent on all of us to be building the next generation of leaders, and diverse generation of leaders,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I believe that Kristie brings different involvement in the community that we don’t really have at the table right now, especially with her involvement with leadership in the Greek community and sorority community,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Although voting in support of the motion to appoint Nguyen, directors Jay Freeman and Jon Hedges pointed to Levine as their initial pick for the position.</p>\n<p>Levine’s widespread work and “valuable” familiarity with other I.V. groups, including I.V. Recreation and Park District and the Environmental Affairs Board, made him better suited for the position, Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“Everyone I talked to has dealt with Jeremy Levine and no one I talked to had ever dealt with Kristie,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman came to the meeting on Tuesday intending to support Sherman for the position, but after Sherman dropped, Freeman turned his support to Levine.</p>\n<p>“I really wanted to come here and be excited to put a woman on our board,” Freeman said. “I’m backing with Jeremy right now.”</p>\n<p>Hedges cited Levine’s record of “reaching across the aisle [and] having a sense of who’s across the aisle” in regard to different political and social groups in I.V. as his reason for supporting Levine.</p>\n<p>“We have to continually reach for that which unites us somehow, that coalesces us somehow, that unifies us somehow in a way that transcends our party,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>During her term, Nguyen said she wants to focus on issues I.V. residents are currently facing, including women’s rights, sexual assault, public safety, lighting deficiencies and lack of parking.</p>\n<p>Nguyen said her variety of perspectives and involvement in the community and campus is an advantage that will be applicable to her service on the board.</p>\n<p>“Students definitely want to see a familiar face and to know that there is someone just like them that can run for a leadership role,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Nguyen hopes the experience she gains during her term will help her work on policymaking in the future.</p>\n<p>“I feel so honored, really, to be on a board of so many people that are so experienced with local government and policymaking, and that’s what I want to do in the future. I’m just so excited,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [5:18 p.m.]: Levine is a member of the Environmental Affairs Board, not the Environmental Awareness Board, as stated in a previous version of this article.</em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies were initially dispatched to the area around midnight after one of several victims reported that the suspects drove through the 6600 block of Picasso Road and the 700 block of Camino Del Sur, shooting out of a car window.</p>\n<p>The unnamed victim who reported the incident was shot in his chest, arms and legs and was left with welts, IVFP Lieutenant Daniel Calderon said.</p>\n<p>As deputies searched the surrounding areas, looking for the car described, they found the vehicle with the four suspects inside. A paintball gun could be seen “in plain view” by the feet of one of the rear passengers, according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>Deputies later found a bag of paintballs in the vehicle and a paintball in one passenger’s pocket while conducting inventory.</p>\n<p>“The seriousness of the case is due to the potential for injury, such as striking a victim in the face, near the eyes, or other soft tissue which could cause severe injury,” Calderon said in an email.</p>\n<p>Three of the suspects, Bell, Russell and Couillard, are students, according to Santa Barbara County Jail custody logs. Gude’s occupation is listed as “sandwich maker.”</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time which schools the aforementioned three attend.</p>\n<p>The men are currently in custody at the Santa Barbara County Jail on $30,000 bails.</p>\n<p>Any person with information about this incident is asked to call 805-681-4179 or leave an anonymous tip <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/home/anonymous-tip/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Shut it down!” <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recently elected 69th A.S. Senate abruptly ended its inaugural meeting after a group of about 60 people stormed the Hub screaming, “Shut it down!” in what the group called an act of “civil disobedience.” The students stomped onto the stage and grabbed microphones away from the sitting senators, who had hastily begun their meeting when 11 senators and Internal Vice President-Elect Steven Ho failed to show up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In similar fashion, 15 senators and proxies didn’t show up to the final 68th Senate meeting earlier that evening. Those who boycotted the meeting did so in an apparent protest of the 12 who </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">didn’t return to last week’s meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the dust settled, it was another instance — the fifth time in six years — in which divestment failed to pass at UC Santa Barbara, which remains the only undergraduate UC campus not to have passed the resolution.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The divestment resolution calls for the UC to withdraw investments from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine. While proponents cite violence in the region as a reason to divest, opponents, largely from the Jewish community, believe the resolution singles out Israel and draws its contents from the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which they deem to be anti-Semitic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday evening was intended to include both the final meeting of the 68th Senate and the first session of the 69th, along with the swearing-in of the elected A.S. executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final meeting of the 68th was supposed to pick up right where it left off — at the conclusion of last week’s meeting, where 12 senators and proxies didn’t return from a recess because the other 13 wouldn’t approve the agenda. The Senate was split over how to categorize the resolution, a distinction that would have significantly altered the necessary voting threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to accept the agenda, to discuss this issue,” said Off-Campus Senator Kristen Armellini. “To say that we didn’t want to discuss it is false.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83282\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83282\" data-attachment-id=\"83282\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/judicial-council-seats-will-be-unfilled-until-at-least-week-9/img_3217/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3217\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83282 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outgoing A.S.

But only 10 senators were present, leading Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu to adjourn the meeting and officially announce that the 68th A.S. Senate’s term was complete. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish we could’ve ended this like we should’ve,” Transfer Senator Kian Maalizadeh said after the meeting was adjourned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 69th A.S. Senate meeting was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m., but IVP-Elect Ho and 11 senators were not present for the first forty minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho, a senator this year, had already communicated he would be late to the 68th senate meeting because his pass time for choosing fall quarter classes was scheduled for 6:30 p.m., according to a statement he sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Marquez, A.S. executive director, texted Ho that all business from the 68th senate would be sent to the 69th senate, Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After this, I got incredibly overwhelmed and had an intense anxiety attack and could not even breathe because that would mean I would have to oversee a bunch of legislation along with elections results,” the statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After waiting for over 20 minutes, Sandhu swore in the 13 senators who were present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without Ho sworn in as the Senate chair, Marquez told the senators they had the authority to elect pro-tempores to run the meeting. The senators rapidly chose Mordi Shadpour to be the first pro-tempore and Lea Toubian as the second pro-tempore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the only reason why they were chosen is because… they were the only two people that applied for that position that were the senators that were sitting there,” said Off-Campus Senator Carla Cernat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadpour and Toubian then took the lead, directing the 69th Senate as they ratified the 2018 A.S. Elections results and approved Ali Suebert, the current A.S. attorney general, to serve another year-long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Shadpour attempted to lead the meeting, outgoing A.S. representatives, including IVP Sandhu, stood in front of the stage, mouthing directions to the new senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incoming A.S. President Brooke Kopel was the only executive candidate to be sworn in after elections results were ratified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho found out through a text message from fellow Senator Andrea Reyes that the 69th senate had appointed pro-tempores in his absence, according to his statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This angered me because I chose my pro-temps based who I see would work best with me and be the best assets to the office and will help me fulfill my role as the presiding officer of senate,” he wrote. “I was literally sitting in the corner trying to breath while all of this was happening. I think it was really disrespectful for the senate to do all of that and take advantage of the state I was in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho stood in the Hub as the 11 senators absent at the start of the meeting walked in at approximately 8:40 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandhu, outgoing senators Sophia Dycaico and Grayson Hernandez and outgoing Student Advocate General Jack Tannenbaum could be seen urging the 69th Senate to speed up the process of passing the motions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once all the senators were seated, Marquez took to the microphone to request that the senators who were already sworn in call for a recess to allow their peers to be officially sworn in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the senators could consider the motion, chants of “Shut it down! Shut it down!” were heard coming from the second floor of the University Center. Approximately 60 students streamed down the stairs, marching toward and onto the stage that the Senate was occupying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newly sworn-in senators hastily adjourned the meeting as the crowd of chanting protesters stepped onstage, grabbing microphones and shouting. Many senators left the Hub altogether before the chants died down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a third-year Global Studies major, introduced the group of protesters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just to let you know, this is an act of civil disobedience,” he said. “We are having a civil disobedience because we think that what’s happening now is illegitimate and unfair.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao had argued as a senate proxy during last week’s meeting that the divestment resolution was directional, holding firm in his stance even after the Senate voted to uphold Sandhu’s decision to alter the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are upset with what is happening, you now share our frustration with last week,” Dumlao said. “So, if you are sharing that frustration, let’s reflect on that and talk about that another time, but for right now, we are going to gather in our community and I suggest you guys [gather] in your community as well,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83280\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83280\" data-attachment-id=\"83280\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/divestment-vote-cancelled-69th-senate-meeting-shut-down-by-civil-disobedience/img_3206/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3206\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83280 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3206.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Internal Vice President Jasmine Sandhu swore in the 13 senators initially present at the meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Dumlao’s introduction, a young woman donning a bandana over her face stepped to the front. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am a Palestinian, and I have to hide my fucking face in front of all of you for the sake of my family,” she said, as Dumlao and a neighboring person rested their hands on her shoulders.
