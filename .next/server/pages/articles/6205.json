The first was my friend Violet,* a member of Delta Zeta sorority at my alma mater, Purdue. Violet and I were both members of the Interfraternity/Panhellenic Council and I remember her as a caring and generous woman. What I didn’t know, however, was that she also suffered from bipolar disorder. What I also did not know until later was that when faced with the prospect of drinking on spring break with her sorority sisters versus taking her medication, she opted for the former, which would have catastrophic results. She would return from that trip, her brain permanently affected and rewired, and she would take a combination of antidepressants and kill herself in her room. That was March 2001.</p>\n<p>To say that I was affected badly was an understatement. It was as if Violet’s death taught me about suicide, which till then had been some sort of abstract concept. Between my rambling emotions and the cheap and ever flowing alcohol, which was some sort of panacea in that Midwestern college town — as it is as well in Isla Vista — I became a depressed, suicidal and sad drunk, and I frightened the hell out of my friends. In the words of the Old ‘97s, “I’ve thought so much about suicide, parts of me have already died.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And then it happened again. After moving out of my fraternity into an apartment, my new roommate, Charlie,* not even 20 years old, took his life November 2001 … about 10 feet away from where I was sleeping on the sofa. He locked himself in his room, set “Circles” by Incubus on repeat, and hanged himself with a belt behind his door. My neighbor and I broke down his door, and his body fell down like a 2 x 4, more wood than man. I never saw his face. You can imagine that at this point, I felt like God and the whole world was just trying to f*** with me. Two suicides in eight months? During my senior year in college?</p>\n<p>While I will never know exactly what was going through Charlie’s mind, I have pieced together the tragic narrative that he followed his high school girlfriend from Valparaiso, Ind. down to West Lafayette in the hopes of dating her again, only to find that she was now dating someone else. I just don’t know, but I can tell you that I was supremely angry at him for ruining my life. Finding his body gave me nightmares for years, and till 2014, I had to sleep using a night light. That is some fear.</p>\n<p>I would lose one more friend to suicide, but it would be after a six-year gap. In May 2007, my fraternity pledge brother, former roommate and friend, Mike, shot himself. Allegedly, like Charlie, he found out that a girl he liked was in love with someone else. The story I have heard is that he took a rose or some flower to a girl who was about to leave on a study abroad trip, and had planned on telling her how he felt. Then he saw her kiss someone else. He went home and out into a field and shot himself in the head. Mike had experienced a horrific childhood including sexual abuse. He channeled that rage into high school sports and, later, as a member of the Marine Corps. I remember him as a gentle giant and as a patriot.</p>\n<p>I have shared this dark part of my life, which at this point almost seems like the only life I have ever known, because I care deeply about suicide prevention here at UCSB. The 2014 Isla Vista shootings were horrifying, but to see the response by the University, community and students has been heartening. I have been very impressed with everything from the #SaySomething campaign to the campus-wide promotion of Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) to a general greater awareness of mental health, but we can do more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I wrote this essay because I want to start a movement at our University not just about suicide, but about the ways that suicide intersects with so many of the facets of Gaucho life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve also been thinking more about this of late because I have seen firsthand the anxiety of freshmen on campus, especially those who started school over the summer. Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara appear like such social places, but that allure is a façade: it is precisely because our locale seems inviting, that we need to do more to make sure that first-year and second-year students know that we are looking out for their success. In her 2015 ESPN article about the January 2014 suicide of 19-year-old Madison Holleran at the University of Pennsylvania, writer Kate Fagan said, “Freshman year of college can be like running an obstacle course wearing a blindfold. Nothing prepares you for how hard the workouts will be, how long they last, what each class will be like, which events are fun and which should be avoided.”</p>\n<p>There are people much more qualified than I am to help suicidal and depressed students, but I wrote this essay because I want to start a movement at our University not just about suicide, but about the ways that suicide intersects with so many of the facets of Gaucho life. There is a tendency at UCSB to view suicide independent of the factors that contribute to it, and which are inspired by it. Let’s start a new conversation.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by expanding suicide-and-depression-related programming at UCSB by having undergraduate and graduate students share their ideas with C.A.P.S. I am a huge fan of Acacia Counseling in Isla Vista, where I have been receiving individual and group therapy for most of my time at UCSB, and I would love to see some sort of partnership between Acacia, UCSB and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (afsp.org) to offer support groups for those who feel suicidal and for survivors of suicide loss.</p>\n<p>Let’s also create more campus-wide and department-specific conversations about the way that mental health has a tendency to interact with most other areas of our lives. Instead of looking at mental health as an independent phenomenon, I would like to see greater accountability from organizations, departments and their leadership to account for suicide and depression when it comes to Greek life, freshmen orientation, nutrition, sports and wellness, mentoring and advising, teaching assistant (TA) and research assistant (RA) education, international student services, alcohol and drug abuse and lastly, social inclusion and inclusion.</p>\n<p>A common Nepali proverb is सास छउन्जेल आस, which roughly translates as “Where there is breath, there is hope.” I accept the statistics and the knowledge that suicide is an American epidemic, but I also know that I can do more, that we can do more. I just want every student to believe that being a Gaucho is about standing together because, in the words of Bill Withers, “We all need somebody to lean on.”</p>\n<p>* Names have been changed to protect identities.</p>\n<p><em>Shyam K.

Some decry an unjust imbalance between defense spending and spending on education. These chalk slogans are classic examples of the logical fallacy, the “straw man.” In a classic straw man fallacy, attention is drawn away from the real issue by a dramatic rhetorical distraction. In this case, the authors of these claims are misleading their readers by diverting attention from real spending numbers.</p>\n<p>The budget figures in the chalk displays are claimed to be about 85 on defense and 5 percent on education. Sometimes (on the more honest displays) it indicates that these are percentages of federal “discretionary spending.” Mandatory federal payments include pensions, Medicare, welfare and state and local transfers. These make up more than half of federal government spending. Discretionary spending, including defense, highways and education, make up the rest.</p>\n<p>In the United States, almost all education spending is done at the state and local level. If one counts state and local spending on educational programs, as one must, then we find education spending is in fact higher than defense spending. For example, during the height of the war in Iraq in 2006, the total spending on education in the United States was $788 billion, while $622 billion was spent on defense.

What we need is a way to “go green” without consequently going broke. One student group has taken care to notice our growing concern and now labors in our stead to get us what we want.<br>\nFamiliarize yourself with them now. The conscientious members of the Student Food Collective, an Office of Student Life group, dedicate themselves to providing us with healthy, ecologically sustainable and ethically sound food while at the same time reducing our environmental impact and supporting our local agricultural economy. They place as equal an emphasis on educating about sustainable practices as they do in implementing them.<br>\nTheir current brainchild is called the “I.V. Food for Thought” project. Through close work and collaboration with Associated Students, SFC plans to provide us with two new excellent places where we can get our nutritious and affordable grub on. The first is a trendy mobile food cart substantially unlike the ones currently sprinkled about campus. SFC’s cart boasts a technologically superior design, powered via solar panel installations. Not only would it be a sick aesthetic addition to behold on our campus, but also a point of pride in the capability of student initiative and mindfulness. The second place is even more tantalizing. SFC plans to re-purpose the restaurant space at 6521 Pardall Rd. — across from Chino’s — into a lively sit-down café. Think of it as Natural Café meets Backyard Bowls and the Daily Grind. They envision it as a chill place to eat, hang and study while also serving as a venue for live music, group events and film screenings. The café’s menu will feature great tasting food that also emphasizes the importance of locally and ethically sourced ingredients. They expect the average meal to be modestly priced around seven dollars. Additionally, they plan to nourish an organic raised bed garden to use as a food source and as an educational workshop space.<br>\nAgain, SFC is in the business of serving us. What grows out of the “I.V. Food for Thought” project does not aim to seek profit. In collaboration with A.S., their goal is to provide a service to UCSB students akin to the A.S. Bike Shop. Student needs provided by student funds. Our Legislative Council has already collected $250,000 in favor of bringing SFC’s project to fruition.<br>\nFor around the last four years, A.S. has seriously entertained a student-run restaurant service on campus as an alternative to current options. It was natural, then, that they sought the guidance and advice this past Winter Quarter of the Student Food Collective. SFC’s robust vision for healthy and affordable sustainable food sources on campus meshed well with A.S.’s idea of a student run venture. Together, they are now engaging in early contractual stages of a five year lease at the Pardall locale. The bulk of potential Spring 2011 funds will be used for amenities typically associated with a restaurant start up, such as pragmatic and stylistic renovations, lighting, educational materials, furniture, inventory and staff wages.<br>\nWhy should we be excited about this? Why is the arrival of these services worthy of our anticipation? First of all, SFC’s is a rather novel endeavor. Through their efforts, we can come to represent a university whose students seek to boldly empower themselves, taking sensible initiative and control over what we eat and how it impacts us, our community and our environment. Furthermore, SFC’s proclaimed mission stands as one we back wholeheartedly: to foster a coalition of like-minded individuals and organizations co-creating, living, learning and nourishing spaces that embody sustainable practices in all aspects.<br>\nLooking toward our future, the viability of our current environmental practices appears grim. But, we, the most revolutionary generation in human history, can put the world on our backs. The efforts of SFC in collaboration with A.S. aim to “fire the first shots” of environmental sensibility. I, for one, am standing behind them.
