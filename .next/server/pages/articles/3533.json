CSD) General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Board Director Jay Freeman were in the audience, but there was no representation from I.V.’s local government on stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said his office did not initially plan to host a town hall this year — until a policy proposal from the Free SB campaign earlier this summer changed that. Following conversations with fellow Associated Students (A.S.) executives and input from Hartmann, Ornelas said his office got to work on the town hall event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall kicked off with brief introductions from each panelist and a description of the work they do at their respective levels to help alleviate the insecurities that are often associated with basic needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a political standpoint, Hartmann, Carbajal and Limón all stressed the importance of food assistance programs such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its California branch, CalFresh, which aim to shed weight from the insecurities of food affordability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you have qualified for [SNAP and CalFresh], the benefits [can be] used at a grocery store, the food co-op, the farmer’s market and the food pantry,” Hartmann added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the university side, Klawunn and Miller highlighted various programs and resources UCSB offers to students in need. Voucher programs, which support housing and meals, for example, can be used by students during times of crisis to help get them through their next meal or next month’s rent, according to Miller, who chairs the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Task Force at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we’re trying to do is get as much direct aid to students as we can around food and around housing,” Klawunn added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the panelists’ introductions, students lined up behind the microphone to speak directly to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question asked to the panel was about the responsibility of the government to support basic needs and its efforts to carry those responsibilities out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every five years, the government passes what is called the Farm Bill. And a good, significant funding of the farm bill is the SNAP program … it’s absolutely imperative that we look out for those who are most vulnerable amongst us and that we work together to provide a safety net,” Carbajal said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation then turned to housing when an audience member asked about affordable housing for campus workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn responded by talking about the proposed construction of additional housing on Ocean Road, where units would be offered for rent at more affordable prices, despite the “staggering” cost of living in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón, a member of the Housing and Community Development committee at the State Assembly who said she has voted in favor of “167 different bills to advance housing,” believes there is no one solution to remediating the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing for “workers, for students, for staff, for anyone — it is a greater conversation and the state has really tried to make some investments,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As questions came in, one student asked the panel how Black students — one of the most underrepresented demographics at UCSB — would be supported through basic needs initiatives and remain “secure” in interactions with university law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann responded with an acknowledgement that “people of color have it much worse” in the context of basic needs. She moved on to highlight local law enforcement’s transparent approaches through new initiatives such as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the UC Police Department’s new chief of police, James Brock, is taking a different approach to law enforcement by consulting students to “hear their voices” and better embed the police department in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a question directed to Miller, one student asked what the university can do better to spread awareness for resources offered on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller acknowledged that spreading awareness for campus resources is the university’s “number one problem” in the context of basic needs. He noted that many initiatives, such as the </span><a href=\"https://hacsb.org/section-8/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing Voucher program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have been difficult to advertise to students because the programs were recently created. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this, he noted that the university works with student interns to spread awareness to the rest of the student body on a grassroots level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the town hall drew to a close, one final question regarding the role of citizenship in eligibility for resources was brought to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón cited Assembly Bill 540, an 18-year-old piece of legislation that “allowed high school students who graduated in California to enroll [in college in California] with in-state tuition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a different </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB540\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 540</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom this October, undocumented students will now have the opportunity to be eligible for certain grants and programs beginning next academic year, according to Limón.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, through UCSB’s incoming “meal plan scholarship,” Miller said the university is trying to establish “parallel programs” to CalFresh and SNAP by offering a campus alternative for undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure undocumented students are on a level playing field,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Carbajal took his turn to respond, he said that documentation and citizenship should not come before helping others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want to live in a country where we look at each other and not think of our humanity,” he said, drawing the town hall to a close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no tangible change that came directly from the town hall in regard to helping students with their basic needs, although politicians and university administrators were presented with a clearer picture of what problems are affecting students the most.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas isn’t entirely sure what his office plans to do following the town hall but is actively “thinking of ways to move forward.” He intends to hand over his office’s work on basic needs to the A.S. Lobby Corps co-chairs who “will be able to give a lot more time and focus to a basic needs campaign.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The California Public Employment Relations Board has already obtained “sufficient evidence” to call for a “formal complaint” against the UC, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to AFSCME, previously undisclosed documents reveal that the UC, in some instances, allegedly amended contracts in secret after establishing a “contractual relationship” with vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, “UC’s initial 2016 contract with Lyon’s Security at UC Office of the President’s UCPath Center in Riverside required the vendor to pay their contractors UC’s </span><a href=\"https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/fairwage/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[$15 an hour]</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimum wage. UC amended the contract in 2018 to exempt Lyon’s Security from this requirement,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/22/workers-at-some-uc-campuses-say-they-dont-earn-fair-wages/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mercury News reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a UC Los Angeles food service worker — who logged over 106 hours in two weeks — was paid under two names to avoid receiving overtime pay; the employee’s base pay was $10.50 an hour, nearly five dollars below the UC’s minimum wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 2017 California State Auditor’s report that was critical of the UC’s “flawed” and “ignored” policies surrounding outsourcing and competitive bidding, the UC allegedly amended its protocols “to require all University locations to either allow existing contracts to expire after 10 years or submit them to renewed competitive bidding,” the document read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After 10 years, then, if UC wished to contract out work for more time, UC is supposed to put out a Request for Proposals (RFP), notify AFSCME and justify to the Union why it seeks to outsource the work for the additional period of time,” the document continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complaint alleged that the university instead granted itself “exemptions” from its own amended policies and extended its existing contracts in secret. This allegedly occurred in secret “at least 28 times” from 2009-2019 at UCLA, when the university added an extra 17 “patient care technical titles” to its contract with AMN Healthcare, a healthcare management service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSMCE also alleged that the UC has spent more money on outsourcing — which has increased by “as much as 52% since 2016” — and has poached union employees’ prospects for employment, opting to instead hire lower wage non-contract workers to do the same jobs, according to a separate press release from AFSCME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In analyses published by State Legislative committees considering reforms to University contracting practices, UC said it spent just over $345 million in 2016 to outsource jobs normally performed by AFSCME 3299 represented UC employees,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In August of 2019, UC notified state legislators that it now spends $523 million on these same services—a growth rate in outsourcing that is roughly three times larger than its direct employment growth for the same jobs,” the press release continued.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contract renewals are on the table, AFSCME said it is the UC’s duty to first determine whether “[the contract] exists to save money solely on the basis of the contractor’s lower wages and benefits, and if so, to bring that work back in house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of approving such contracts, AFSCME said the UC allegedly goes about filling those positions secretly, leaving contract employees in a “contingent” status, which keeps them at arm’s length from the benefits and wages of full-time employment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allegedly occurred at UC San Francisco, where 62 contracted employees working for Allied Barton, a security service, applied for “career positions” at UCSF, according to the document. Only 11 positions were filled despite many Allied Barton employees “applying to open positions two or more times,” the document read. AFSCME alleged this is a result of UCSF’s decision to keep workers retained to a contingent status.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the recent complaints and strike announcement, Andrew Gordon, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said in an email that the UC finds that “AFSCME leaders have shown little flexibility on their unreasonable wage demands,” even after announcing its sixth strike since negotiations began in spring 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leader’s contracting claims and continual strike activity are attempts to gain leverage in negotiations. UC’s agreements with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting and no employee can be terminated as a result of a sub-contracting decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually increased systemwide by double digits over the past five years. The number of service workers has grown 16.8 percent, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9 percent,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to UCOP’s stance, AFSCME finds that the UC’s treatment of its employees warrants a reaction that goes beyond the bargaining table — “the picket lines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is so troubling about UC’s continuing illegal conduct is that it’s becoming even more prevalent,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME president, said. “These complaints detail UC’s continuing systematic and often secretive efforts to replace its own employees with lower wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Leyva, who authored the bill, said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-10-04-bill-ensuring-timely-pay-uc-workers-approved-governor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the bill mandates that the UC pay its nearly 140,000 employees on their regularly scheduled payday, or be paid in accordance with university policy if paid on a more frequent basis, according to Tom Hintze, a graduate student at UC Davis and member of UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite payment complications resulting from UCPath issues in the past, the UC never faced any wage theft penalties because it is a public sector institution, which doesn’t require employers to pay fines for each payroll violation, Hintze said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees under the umbrella of UCPath looking to file a claim with the payroll system were often forced to wait an unknown sum of weeks, and in some cases, months, to get their paycheck, Hintze said. SB 698, however, allots a five-day period for the payroll system to pay employees in full. Otherwise, employers will be subject to legal action through the Private Attorneys General Act, which enables workers to sue “in order to recoup their wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara first implemented UCPath in Fall Quarter 2018, but experienced shortfalls similar to other universities in the UC system when the UC Student Association released a list of demands to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsa-releases-demands-to-uc-regarding-ucpath-implementation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide restitution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for student workers affected by the payroll system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hintze said he began working for UAW 2865 in spring 2018 but didn’t take notice of UCPath’s “major problems” until May of 2018, when the payroll system was implemented at UC Merced and UC Riverside. Six months later, UCPath migrated to UCSB and UC Los Angeles, where there was “somewhere near a thousand people” who either weren’t paid on time, weren’t paid the right amount or lost benefits in the process, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, especially those who often rely on a consistent pay schedule, have been bruised by UCPath’s inconsistent pay periods. In one instance at UCSB, an employee had their car repossessed as a result of “not being paid on time,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, three employees were greeted with eviction notices after missing two months’ worth of pay due to the payroll system’s inability to accommodate for a shift in pay periods, according to Hintze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath is expected to continue rolling out through 2020 at other universities such as UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. Hintze stressed the timeliness of SB 698, which he hopes will help prevent a “major disaster like last year” when payroll issues arose from UCPath’s integration at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath’s migration across the UC system also marks a shift in payroll infrastructure. Hintze acknowledged that payroll problems predated UCPath’s arrival but said they were significantly easier to dispute because those former payroll centers were the respective campuses. Now, the UC has shifted the entire payroll system solely to UC Riverside, but the checks themselves don’t come from there; instead, according to Hintze, checks are “cut” and distributed from out of state, making it even harder to navigate the payroll process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While SB 698 will not repair any payroll damage incurred before it became law, Hintze said the UAW was successful in settling with the university to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compensate every employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affected by UCPath’s payroll errors last February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each worker who was affected was eligible for $150 for each paycheck that [UCPath] had affected. So, the university paid out over $162,000 to student workers in damages,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
