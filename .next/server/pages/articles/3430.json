Anthony<em> Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name. Now, students have five more reasons to flock to the shop.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker, Buster Brown and Maisy have become an integral part of the Isla Vista community through their eagerness and friendly nature.</p>\n<p>Tracy Holt, who opened Precious Slut Tattoo 12 years ago, said his dogs are a form of support for Isla Vistans and visitors on both good and bad days.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s finals, boyfriends, girlfriends just broke up with you, parents kicking them out of school, wrecked the car, DUI,” Holt said. “Everyone in Isla Vista seems to know those dogs; a lot of people know them by name.”</p>\n<p>Holt said he has owned dogs for his whole life and once owned 11 dogs at the same time. He said the “unmeasured” companionship is unlike any other.</p>\n<p>“There’s just no greater form of friendship,” Holt said. “It’s unsolicited.”</p>\n<p>While all of the dogs have been raised under the same roof, they’ve each developed distinct personalities.</p>\n<p>Stormy, one of the American Pit Bull Terriers, is seven years old and has established herself as the alpha dog of the pack. She is strong and protective but loving, and she insists on sitting at the kitchen table for dinner each night.</p>\n<p>Jacob, the six-year-old “chicken” and second pit bull, gets creative when it comes to stealing more time with Holt.</p>\n<p>“Jake sits on my shoes in the morning ’cause he knows I need them to leave,” Holt laughed.</p>\n<p>Holt said he is not supposed to have a favorite, but has a special attachment to Tucker, a two-year-old French Bulldog. The codependent Tucker follows Holt around everywhere he goes.</p>\n<p>Maisy is a one-and-a-half-year-old French Bulldog who enjoys fighting sprinklers in her free time.</p>\n<p>Buster Brown, the 10-month-old French Bulldog and baby of the group, is always ready for a chase, even if it means running into the street during a <em>Nexus</em> interview.</p>\n<p>Despite their varying ages and unique traits, Holt said all the dogs are protective and ready to defend anyone in need, even against Holt himself.</p>\n<p>“I’ve raised those dogs to protect anyone,” Holt said proudly, comparing it to raising children.</p>\n<p>“If you raise that animal to be shitty to other people … then I don’t feel that that dog is going to defend you,” he said. “You’ve allowed that to happen.”</p>\n<p>Owners should be especially mindful in raising muscular dogs like pit bulls because they have a greater potential for defense than smaller dogs, Holt said.</p>\n<p>“The only problem with the scenario of a pit bull is he’s genetically built and designed to be that star kind of athlete,” he said. “He just … is more capable of defending.”</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Holt’s dog of 14 years died. He didn’t know if he would get another.</p>\n<p>“There was such a vacancy in my life, a lack of protection, a lack of ability to hear what was going on outside my house,” he said. “I never noticed that void in my whole life … and then I just realized how vulnerable I felt without it.”</p>\n<p>Holt had trouble putting into words the positive impact that his pups have had on his life.</p>\n<p>“The thing that I feel like so many people are looking for in the world and don’t know where to find it … I feel like I’ve done all of that in this little mini group of mine,” he said.</p>\n<p>Holt owns two other Precious Slut Tattoo shops in Nevada in addition to the Isla Vista location.</p>\n<p>One of the shops is located in Las Vegas, where 58 people died in a mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Holt, recalling the devastation in Isla Vista after the events of May 23, 2014, said the dogs have acted as a source of comfort for both communities in mourning.</p>\n<p>“If I could only say anything, it’s how at the end of the day no matter how shitty life is, no matter how bad this big mass shooting thing in Vegas… People come here and they pet these dogs, and you see it make a difference in people’s lives,” Holt said.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker,  Buster Brown and Maisy have been around to see several UCSB graduating classes come and go, and alumni remember them when they come back to visit.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

especially because the team’s perimeter shots weren’t falling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, we were sped up,” junior point guard Danae Miller said. “We felt the energy coming into the game, but once we settled down, we got right into our groove.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Miller, senior guard Tal Sahar and senior guard Coco Miller each hit a 3 on consecutive possessions to stretch the zone, the ‘Chos were able to get the offense going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, the Matadors did an admirable job of slowing down freshman forward-center Ila Lane on the offensive end. In one of her least efficient performances of the season, Lane finished the game shooting only 35.3% from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were physical with [Lane], so she couldn’t get high-percentage catches,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a testament to Lane’s talent and effort, however, the freshman phenom still finished the game with her 16th double-double of the season, logging 19 points and 13 rebounds on the night. During one particularly impressive moment in the second quarter, Lane launched her 6-foot-4-inch frame onto the hardwood for a loose ball. After grabbing it, Lane proceeded to run the length of the floor, finishing the play with an easy layup to give the ‘Chos an 18-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While her box score wasn’t overly impressive, freshman point guard Johnni Gonzalez turned in one of her finest performances of the season on Thursday. With Coco Miller in foul trouble for most of the night, Gonzalez was forced to be the second ball-handler. Displaying the tantalizing talent she has shown in brief stretches all season, Gonzalez frequently wowed teammates and the crowd with her ability to beat the full-court press. Just before the half, Gonzalez drilled a deep 3 to give UCSB a comfortable 32-15 lead heading into the locker room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second half, however, CSUN came storming back — led in large part by freshman Deja Williams and senior De’Jionae Calloway. The Matadors went on a 19-8 run to kick off the third quarter, with Williams pouring in 12 of her 20 points during the quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We missed a bunch of shots at the rim, and they were able to get momentum,” Henrickson said. “We need to clean that up and finish stronger.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With 2:14 left in the third, the Gauchos’ lead had been cut to merely 6 points. Then, Danae Miller made magic happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three possessions in a row, Danae Miller attacked the teeth of the CSUN defense, getting a step on the perimeter and forcing her defender to panic. Three possessions in a row, Danae Miller drew a foul; with the Matadors in the bonus, that meant free throws.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making 5 of her 6 free throws, Danae Miller found Lane underneath the hoop for an easy layup, opening up a 47-36 lead for the team at the end of the quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, Danae Miller finished the game with 21 points, 4 assists, 5 rebounds and an eye-boggling 7 fouls drawn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Matadors kept the pressure on in the fourth, with Calloway chipping in 8 of her 18 points in the quarter, the team was unable to overcome the deficit. CSUN was able to cut the lead to 3 with 10 seconds left, but Gonzalez hit 2 clutch free throws to ensure the ‘Chos came away with the crucial victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSB must turn its attention to UC Riverside, who knocked off the Gauchos 66-61 earlier this season. Santa Barbara takes on UC Riverside at 2 p.m. on Saturday at the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

The sea of devastated faces at Clinton campaign headquarters; the corruption festering in our voting system; Obama drinking the water in Flint — these images leached away what little remained of my faith in this democracy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, I sat in the same spot, a crowd screaming “USA! USA!” on TV again. Only this time, it wasn’t at a Trump rally. It was at a soccer game in Lyon, France.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A soccer dropout at age 10, I’d never had much interest in “the beautiful game.” I would rather watch “Bend It Like Beckham” than sit field-side at my siblings’ matches. Yet I found myself caught up in the excitement of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, mesmerized not only by the U.S. team’s athletic prowess, but also by the players themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media fed my newfound obsession. I delighted in the training camp vlogs (including one that was </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEbylhNxVZk&amp;t=1s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filmed at UCSB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), player biographies and compilations of funny moments featured on U.S. Soccer’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I watched these women dominate on the field, crack jokes, work out and sing on buses, cars and planes. Camaraderie was essential to their game: these players were fiercely competitive and fiercely loving of both their sport and one another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I read about their </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fight for gender parity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my admiration grew. Players like Alex Morgan have </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfM0LT_TUNQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spoken</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how beating the drum increases the pressure to win. Yet not once have they folded — not against the U.S. Soccer Federation, which </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/why-the-us-national-womens-soccer-team-is-suing/585202/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pays female athletes nearly a third of what it pays males</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite the women’s team consistently outperforming the men’s and generating considerably more revenue — and certainly not against the competition. The team’s victory in the final match amplified the chants of “EQUAL PAY! EQUAL PAY!” that rang throughout Stade de Lyon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feud between Trump and the team, which erupted </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/sports/trump-megan-rapinoe-tweet.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, could not have been more symbolic of the political moment. About halfway through the tournament, a reporter for the soccer magazine Eight by Eight asked co-captain Megan Rapinoe whether or not the team planned to visit the White House if they won. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> old days</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not going to the fucking White House,” Rapinoe </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/8by8mag/status/1143595809910530048\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot back</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The next day, Trump </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1143892328236687361\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retorted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with, “Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!” Their 2-0 victory in the Cup final — including a goal by Rapinoe — spoke for itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings me to the centerpiece of my fascination: the lavender-haired winner of the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards, the undisputed star of the World Cup and the new face of women’s soccer, Megan Anna Rapinoe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though her fame reached new heights during this summer’s World Cup, Rapinoe has been a leader on and off the field for years. In 2016, she was one of five players to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">file a federal complaint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the U.S. Soccer Federation for wage discrimination and is one of 28 plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed three months before the 2019 Cup. She also sparked controversy for </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/soccer/uswnts-megan-rapinoe-kneels-during-national-anthem-solidarity-colin-kaepernick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kneeling during the national anthem</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of Colin Kaepernick at a Seattle Reign game in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties,” Rapinoe said afterwards. “It’s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team spokesperson, Rapinoe leads with grace and an effervescent sense of humor. She doesn’t talk trash — not even about the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation, Carlos Cordeiro, who was </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5623697/us-soccer-equal-pay-megan-rapinoe/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">booed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the crowd at the team’s post-victory New York City ticker-tape parade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s with us. I think he’s on the right side of things. I think he’s going to make things right,” she said. “We look forward to holding those feet to the fire.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a rousing victory </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfeFJlwUyQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Rapinoe addressed, among other things, the diversity of the team: “We have pink hair and purple hair. We have tattoos, dreadlocks. We’ve got white girls, black girls and everything in between. Straight girls, gay girls.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Observing the reactions of the crowd, itself a mishmosh of young and old, white, brown and black, I cannot overstate the importance of this message. Highlighting this intersection of identities is not just preaching to the liberal choir or a PR stunt. The U.S. women’s national team paints a far more accurate picture of America than the almost exclusively white-male Trump administration does. Its players embody the values of compassion, honor and resilience that are so lacking in our national politics. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it essential that Americans see themselves in this team but also that the world see </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this team. Broadcasted on hundreds of networks and reaching a record number of viewers (approximately </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48882465\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) worldwide, the World Cup winning team represented an America that other parts of the world may not otherwise get to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infinitely more American than the “</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/27/in-good-old-days-donald-trump-says-campaign-protesters-got-more-than-just-an-escort-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good old days</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team’s vision of progress. “This is my charge to everyone: We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We’ve got to listen more and talk less,” Rapinoe said as she neared the end of her speech. “It’s our responsibility to make the world a better place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Team USA’s triumph, much champagne was spilled and “We Are the Champions” sang. But their victory was a celebration of female friendship, sportsmanship and hard work, rather than the boastful nationalism that often colors patriotic rhetoric. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as I love watching these athletes play, I value them more for what they inspire. And I don’t just mean the children who dream of going pro — that doesn’t account for their devoted fan base or the millions who tuned in to watch the World Cup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They inspire me to make the most of the platform I have to advocate for what I believe in. I may be too far gone for the soaring idealism of the American dream, but Megan Rapinoe’s dissent — and absolute kickassery — is a form of patriotism that I can get behind. Her courage moves me profoundly, evoking the same feeling the national anthem used to, the feeling of belonging to something bigger than myself — if not to a country, than to a dream. I am learning that the two are not mutually exclusive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fall, I will be studying abroad. I used to joke that when asked where I’m from, I’ll just say “California” to avoid being associated with Trump’s America. But now, knowing that this is also the America of the U.S. Women’s National Team, red, white and blue — with a dash of lavender — doesn’t seem so bad to rep after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s to you, USWNT.
