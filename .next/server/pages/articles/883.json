As a team, UCSB shot 48.1 percent from the field and 44.1 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Everything I shoot now, I feel like is going to go in the hoop,” Brew said. “Getting to the rim was probably a big key [for us tonight.]”</p>\n<p>The Aggies dropped to 1-2 in the conference with the loss. Junior forward guard Eddie Miller led Davis with 18 points after hitting eight of his 12 shots from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face Pacific on Saturday, who just lost 44-39 to Cal Poly at home. “Coach Thompson will have [the Tigers] ready and ornery,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>While Cal Poly is considered one of the weaker teams in the conference, the team had a close outing against #7 San Diego State, which escaped San Luis Obispo with a 51-45 victory on Dec. 13.</p>\n<p>“We need to string together [good] efforts,” Williams said, discussing his squad’s tendency to play with inconsistent intensity from game to game this season. “I was pleased with the effort today, but we need to make an even better effort on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>The game against Pacific takes place in Stockton at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

athleticism.</p>\n<p>“[Nicole] brings a ton of energy,” Gottlieb added. “At this level, to have someone that comes off the bench that can change the game is such a big advantage for us.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Nesbit was a dancer rather than a point guard, but once she was introduced to basketball as a nine-year-old, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>“The first time I went to a tryout, it felt like it fit,” Nesbit said. “I had so much fun. My parents told me that it took me a couple of days to take off my basketball shoes. I fell in love with the game.”</p>\n<p>Nicole is always one of the smaller players on her teams, but that has not stopped her from finding success.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that size limits anything,” Nesbit said. “You just have to work a little bit harder or be a little tougher than the players you go up against.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the player who had the biggest influence on Nesbit growing up was former NBA all-star Allen Iverson. His small size and ability to attack the basket over larger defenders provided the guard with a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p>With energy off the bench, Nesbit’s role on the team this year has constantly grown, progressing into an especially important one for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It’s been so fun to watch her grow this year,” junior guard Emilie Johnson said. “From the first game until now, she has learned so much and improved her game. I’m excited to see how that pays off in a year and how good we can be next year.”</p>\n<p>Johnson has been a mentor to Nesbit, helping her to become more mature with her game. The influence goes the other way, too.</p>\n<p>“Her play has definitely opened up my game,” Johnson said. “She draws so many defenders because she is so quick and that gives me an extra second to focus and make my shot.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the season, Nesbit has proved that she is ready to go out and conquer any challenges thrown her way. Despite the struggles that come with adjusting to college, Nesbit has managed to excel, thanks largely to her family.</p>\n<p>“I think they have been to every one of my games,” Nesbit said. “It’s a huge transition from high school, school-wise and basketball-wise. Having my parents here has been a huge help and I really appreciate them for that.”</p>\n<p>Fellow UCSB players have helped Nesbit adjust to college as well, as Nesbit has grown incredibly close to her teammates.</p>\n<p>“Our team is like one big happy family,” Nesbit said. “Being with the team is my most exciting time of the day. When we leave practice, we miss each other.”</p>\n<p>In particular, Nesbit has grown close to fellow freshman guard Melissa Zornig.</p>\n<p>“We are really tight off the court and I think I am closest with her,” Zornig said. “I’m really excited to be able to play with her over the next three years.”</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the team, Nesbit has one goal in mind for the 2011 season.</p>\n<p>“As far as basketball, winning the state championship in high school was my biggest accomplishment,” Nesbit said. “That was one of the proudest moments of my life, and that’s why I want a Big West championship, because I would be on that stage on a different level and with different people.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit and UCSB host UC Irvine tonight at the Thunderdome, with a scheduled tip-off of 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-09/nicole-nesbit-tall-odds/","id":880,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[879,878,877],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle to Knock Off Unbeaten UC Davis on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Facing UC Davis for the second time in just over a week, the Gauchos dropped their second and final match against the Aggies much like the first.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79763\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2080556665\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80653\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79763\" data-attachment-id=\"79763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/womens-basketball-to-host-seattle-in-home-opener/akilah-jennings-shoots-a-layup-and-draws-a-foul-stephen-mangadaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Akilah Jennings shoots a layup and draws a foul.

History seemed to repeat itself, as that was again the same story.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was heated, with both teams going blow for blow. In a quarter that was a fast-paced battle consisting of back-and-forth basketball, neither team led by more than four points.</p>\n<p>Looking at the scoreboard, it was 45-44 after the third – UCSB clinging on to their one-point advantage going into the last quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>The visitors opened their last quarter with a subpar performance, scoring just three points over the first seven minutes. During that same time, UC Davis outscored their opponents 15-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos attempted to stomp their way back into the game to get the win, but ultimately their attempt was futile. The Aggies outscored UCSB 25-18 in the last quarter of regulation, solidifying their second win against Santa Barbara in just a few days.</p>\n<p>UCSB Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a monster game, leading all scorers with 25 points – equaling her career-high. Bates was on fire from long range, draining seven of twelve from downtown.</p>\n<p>The only other players scoring double digits for the visiting Gauchos were redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman who scored 13 points, and senior guard Makala Roper who notched 12 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Edelman had her fifth double-double of the season, seasoning 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points. And Roper’s 12 points were scored as she came off the bench, and she impressively went four of five from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos who scored in double digits were seemingly the only gleaming spot for the visiting team, as the rest of the team went only went 4 for 27 from the field.

It will be a great test for us, but at the same time no championships will be won in early January.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies split their first two conference games, winning 78-56 over Northridge after losing 58-56 to Fullerton. UCSB has not lost its first home conference game since 1989. A win would extend the squad’s winning streak in conference home openers to 22.</p>\n<p>UCSB is 11-6 all-time against UC Davis. However, the Aggies have won the last  three of the teams’ meetings, the last of which was in the Big West semifinals last year.</p>\n<p>“They are a really good team and they are also really good at what they run,” Valentine said. “It will be a good match-up because they have a little bit of height too, and it will be a really good and crucial conference game for us. If we come out, and we execute well and take care of the ball, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that we will do a phenomenal job.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are led by 6’2” senior Paige Mintun and 6’ sophomore Vicky Deely, who average 13.5 and 11.2 points per game, respectively. This game figures to be a defensive battle, with UCSB holding opponents to a Big West best 34.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We need to practice hard and prepare to beat their zone,” senior forward Margaret Johnson said. “The last couple of teams we have played used that, so it has prepared us. It is going to be a challenge, but we are excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to get off to their first 2-0 start in conference play for the first time since the 2008-09 season.</p>\n<p>“Getting better is important. The teams that stop getting better in January are not going be the ones winning in March,” Gottlieb said. “We need to keep getting better so that as other teams are leveling off we can hopefully be the best team in March. We want to win every time we step on the floor, but the team also understands we want to be the best possible team throughout the season, particularly in March.”</p>\n<p>The game takes place at the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/chos-play-big-west-home-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/chos-play-big-west-home-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/chos-play-big-west-home-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/chos-play-big-west-home-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-05/chos-play-big-west-home-game/","id":882,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[881,880,879],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
