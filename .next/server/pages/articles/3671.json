The Senate now plans to meet this Friday at 11 a.m. to vote on the agenda for tonight’s meeting, and again on May 3 at 6 p.m. to vote on tabled bills, pending the approval of Dean of Student Life and Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead to hold a meeting during Week 10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a regular Senate term, Week 9 of spring quarter is the last meeting of the year before the summer break; due to Zoombombings, the 71st Senate has not been able to hold a full meeting or vote on any resolutions since the new senators were sworn in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s meeting began just after 6:30 p.m., but was stalled as White had difficulty navigating Zoom during the meeting. After Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan motioned to approve all 2020-21 year appointments, with the exception of Attorney General Tyler Barth and those within the Internal Vice President’s (IVP) office, a debate broke out about when to discuss the appointments that had not been pushed through.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After running into problems with voting without the Zoom poll feature, White created a new Zoom link to include the feature. However, immediately after participants joined the new link, multiple Zoombombers disrupted the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Zoombomber loudly shouted, “Fuck you, fuck you dirty bitch.” Others displayed obscene media, including a video of someone appearing to masturbate on camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, White muted all participants’ microphones and created a separate Zoom breakout room for the senators to discuss how to handle the rest of the meeting. As senators discussed options, approximately 40 people remained in the main meeting room, where Zoombombers continued to show obscene photos as their images. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once senators realized the disturbances were ongoing, White told senators she would make a new link — the third of the night — to be shared only with the senators and Associated Students (A.S.) staff. A.S. Legislative Liaison Holly Mayes then ended the original meeting without warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators then met for over an hour in a private Zoom call to discuss when to hold future meetings and what precautions should be taken in light of the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the last meeting, the senators had thrown around a handful of ideas about how to conduct secure, but public, Zoom meetings. Moving forward, meetings will now be held as Zoom webinars, where only panelists are visible and able to speak, as opposed to anyone in the meeting, according to White. For public forum, individuals will be enabled as panelists when it is their turn to talk, and then will be removed as panelists after speaking in order to prevent future Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To alleviate technical difficulties in executing the new webinar system at the next meeting, senators plan to meet 30 minutes before the meeting on Friday to run through the new format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During tonight’s private meeting, senators also began working on a public statement to address the Zoombombings and the abrupt ending to the regular meeting. White said the Senate plans to publish the statement tomorrow afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Her Senate resolution, which is positional and only takes a stance on the issue, urges the university to “bear the increased financial consequences of a situation that is essentially out of their control.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, this could come in the shape of university-subsidized housing, where students are exempted from paying any potential inflations in room and board prices if their housing rates increase as a result of room availability changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe UCSB’s Housing department should not inflate room and board prices in an effort to make up for any lost revenue from students who decide not to, or are unable to, live on-campus during a possible [sic] hybrid/online course period,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gurleen Pabla, a first-year political science major and on-campus senator who seconded the resolution, said she is concerned that students of color, low-income students and first-generation students will be “disproportionately disadvantaged” if the only options for on-campus housing are singles or doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of students that otherwise wouldn’t have to take out as many loans or spend as much time also doing a job just to maintain a single or a double when they could have comfortably, or at least not been so concerned, with living in a triple or quad,” Pabla said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfair to students that just want to have a fun college life and that are now having to deal with this concern of a price [for a single or double room],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/rates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s housing website,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the 2019-20 rate of a triple room with fourteen meals a week is $15,767 per year. The rate of a double room with 14 meals a week is $17,767, $2,000 more than the triple, and the rate of a single room with 14 meals a week is $19,267, $3,500 more per year than the triple room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the precarity of fall quarter in mind, De Ramon said “it’s really important that the university, and every department within the university, always puts students and the needs of students before any sort of profit or revenue.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Barbara County. Hayley Tice/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang sent out an email Tuesday afternoon notifying students about the case in Isla Vista, adding that the case was “a previously confirmed case of COVID-19 [which] was found to be located within the boundaries of the Isla Vista community” after the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department began using GIS mapping to identify confirmed cases.</p>\n<p>“<strong>We have no indication that this case involves anyone affiliated with UC Santa Barbara</strong>, but given the proximity of Isla Vista to campus, the number of our students who live in Isla Vista, and our faculty and staff who live in Isla Vista or adjacent communities, we wanted to notify our campus community of this development,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>Yang also added that two people affiliated with UCSB who live together tested positive for coronavirus after one returned from Europe on March 13.</p>\n<p>“<strong>Both individuals have not been on campus and have been in self-quarantine since March 13.</strong> They currently remain in self-quarantine off campus and are recovering,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>At the Monday afternoon press conference, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, the Santa Barbara Public Health Department public health officer, said the rise in cases in Santa Barbara County had been expected by the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The increase in numbers is very typical for a virus that spreads quickly from person to person. We expected a doubling of cases within three days and that is almost exactly what we have seen,” Ansorg said. “It is an indicator of just how infectious this thing is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to slow the continued rise of cases and mitigate the spread of the virus, Ansorg also emphasized the necessity of social distancing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only definitive factor which makes a substantial difference between the best and worst case scenario is how much community members stay physically isolated from each other. Continuing with our current efforts of social distancing will make all the difference,” Ansorg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ansorg did not specifically mention the I.V. case during the conference, it was announced about two hours later through the Santa Barbara Public Health Department </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBCPublicHealth/status/1244799094272471042\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter account.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the confirmation of an I.V. coronavirus case, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) issued a state of emergency in I.V. at its March 24 virtual meeting, strongly urging the county to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take all necessary actions to slow the spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we have a case of COVID-19 in Isla Vista, it is time for Isla Vistans to take social distancing seriously. This is a public health crisis that will affect not just our older folks — it will affect student-aged individuals too,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In accordance with federal, state and local mandates ordering social distancing and banning gatherings of more than 10 people, the district also urged Isla Vistans at its meeting to avoid any mass gatherings, including Deltopia — the yearly unsanctioned street party held on the first weekend of spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD postponed its planned </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/alternative-deltopia-festival-postponed-indefinitely-due-to-ucsb-coronavirus-precautions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative Deltopia festival</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, after UC Santa Barbara announced its </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on March 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that if Deltopia takes place, that could be catastrophic for our public health system. Our public resources are almost entirely devoted to fighting this public health crisis right now, at the county, state and all the way to the local level down to us here in Isla Vista,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be very, very inappropriate to use this weekend to break the social distancing order and go out and party.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB, in accordance with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent an email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to campus organizations on March 12 that discouraged students from participating in Deltopia to help control the spread of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><em>[Updated: 3/31/20 1:07 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
