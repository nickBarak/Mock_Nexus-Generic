You can’t teach parkour.”</p>\n<p>With a background in martial arts, Doyle became a professional parkour athlete at age 18. In 2007, he won the first international parkour competition, the Red Bull Art of Motion in Austria.</p>\n<p>“I guess parkour started in Europe, but that’s just a name. People have been free running and jumping on stuff for years,” Doyle said. “Just look at Jackie Chan. It has been around forever. The French just commercialized it.”</p>\n<p>Doyle currently designs parkour courses with Red Bull to improve competitions. After flipping around university campuses along the California coast, he will head to Hawaii to create a course amongst the trees hanging over sandy beaches.</p>\n<p>“There’s only a handful of guys who are doing this professionally and we all come from different sports,” Doyle said. “We’re not judging the contestants really anymore. We’re judging the course for which style suits it best.”</p>\n<p>With nearly 2.5 million views on his official YouTube channel, Doyle’s aerial tricks and acrobatic parkour moves have become Internet sensations. His 44 official uploads can be found at www.youtube.com/user/10055870.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

id=\"caption-attachment-57927\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The UCSB Faculty Association held a town hall meeting to discuss the health insurance plan created by the University of California Office of the President.</p></div>\n<p>The Faculty Association held a town hall meeting in Corwin Pavilion yesterday afternoon issuing an open letter addressing their concerns with the recent transition to UC Care, a systemwide Preferred Provider Organization health insurance plan (PPO) created by the UC Office of the President specifically for UC faculty.</p>\n<p>According to the letter, under UC Care, implemented earlier this year, faculty and staff do not have the same access to health care plans as staff on other UC campuses. The letter also states the Santa Barbara area also lacks tier-one health insurance options, which would provide generic medications instead of specialty and brand name medication.</p>\n<p>President of the Faculty Association Nelson Lichtenstein said there are several issues with the UC Care plan as it applies to university faculty. According to Lichtenstein, one main problem was that Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital is not included in the UC Insurance Plan, and there is an extra cost to faculty who get care provided to them by the hospital.</p>\n<p>“The UC Care health system is a set-up that is clearly not working. The most important hospital, the only one, is not part of that system,” Lichtenstein said. “We have staff that need to use the facility that can’t use it without it costing them more money.”</p>\n<p>According to the letter, the transition to UC Care eliminated the university faculty’s access to Anthem/Blue Cross provided coverage, which the letter states poses numerous problems in the quality of faculty care.</p>\n<p>“This transition has generated difficulties at all campuses, but at Santa Barbara the elimination of Anthem/Blue Cross and the introduction of UC Care as a replacement have resulted in a series of inequities related to level of care, the cost of care, and the availability and continuity of care,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>The letter also states that while the Sansum Clinic, another regional healthcare provider for Santa Barbara, is included in UC Care as a tier-one option, the coverage it provides is “incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Sansum Clinic has signed on to UC Care, but only on a year by year basis. Santa Barbara Select HMO, an association of independent physicians serving our community, is not part of the UC Care tier one network,” the letter states. “Meanwhile, other UC campuses without medical centers, notably Santa Cruz and Riverside, have been able to convince officials in the Office of the President to negotiate with and secure UC Care tier-one coverage by local providers and hospitals in their communities.”</p>\n<p>The letter additionally cites issues presented by signing up with Sansum, including long wait times for an initial appointment with a doctor, existing limits on the capacity of Sansum to provide access to faculty and the extra costs incurred by getting care at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital as a tier-two provider.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein said that without the Cottage Hospital, patients are forced to go to Los Angeles for the next closest hospital.</p>\n<p>“It’s the only quality hospital in the area before LA and for faculty suffering chronic illnesses, 30 percent of the faculty is above 60, they would be consigned to go to UCLA, which is not practical,” Lichtenstein said.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, other UC Campuses are also having problems with the implementation of the new insurance policies at other campuses.</p>\n<p>“Other campuses aren’t particularly happy either, Santa Cruz is one of them,” Lichtenstein said. “Turns out UC Health care hospitals aren’t designed to treat everyday illnesses, they’re for research and they’re good at it … even UCLA has problems with their rates going way up. We’re particularly pissed because our rates went up too but we aren’t getting access to the best hospital between L.A and San Francisco. UCOP should have thought about that before they made it system-wide.”</p>\n<p>Faculty members such as professor of geography Ray Smith posed suggestions to solve the UC Health program’s lack of coverage.</p>\n<p>“Going back to trying to do something independent, they could send a delegation to UCLA and see if they could send a satellite hospital to UCSB,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Faculty Advisor to the Chancellor’s Office Richard Watts said UC Care may eventually close down on its own.</p>\n<p>“Come 2016 we could be on the edge of having UC Care so expensive it will run out of business anyhow,” Watts said.</p>\n<p>During the discussion, questions were raised regarding the effectiveness of the letter to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Several attendees said a possible first step would be to meet with Yang in a group setting to openly discuss the issues.</p>\n<p>Professor of Physics Harry N. Nelson said the problem with the letter to Yang is that it did not produce responses.</p>\n<p>“Given that there was a major problem last year, I’m kind of surprised they never want to come back and see what happened,” Nelson said. “If they actively don’t want to check back, tactically it’s unimaginable that they don’t care enough to see if their solution worked.”</p>\n<p>The town hall ended with a general consensus to meet with Yang for further discussion of premiums and quality of care and begin taking action by the end of the open enrollment period for this year, toward changes in the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>According to Lichtenstein, further action needs to be taken soon.</p>\n<p>“I think the takeaway from this meeting is we weren’t just making accusations, we chose Kum-Kum [Bhavnani] to delegate a committee to explore our options,” Lichtenstein said. “Whether that is legal action or anything else, we need to begin to negotiate right now with UCOP so we can start to make decisions.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Ray Smith as an entomology professor.

Senate meeting propositions a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office and addresses an IRS ruling to pay A.S. Program Board via stipend. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met in the Flying A Room at the UCen last night to discuss potential campus construction projects and issues surrounding A.S. Program Board member payment.</p>\n<p>Among topics discussed during last night’s meeting was a proposal for new construction of the A.S. Main Office, currently located in the MultiCultural Center (MCC), in order to create a space providing easier access for students. In addition, an Internal Revenue Services (IRS) ruling to pay A.S. Program Board members via stipend instead of honoraria was also addressed.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said her proposal for additional construction to the A.S. Main Office would extend the building to create a new campus entrance.</p>\n<p>“This is not an expansion of the presidential office,” Guthy said. “It’s actually demolishing the Office of the President to create a new entrance to A.S. Main [Office] to make it more accessible for students.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, while there is no money currently underway to be spent on the project until further consultation from all of A.S., she wants to “explore the idea” and has an image in mind for the construction.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to create a huge main entrance next to the ticket office,” Guthy said. “Then we would probably enclose that top balcony area to create more of an office/conference room space, because currently it’s really underutilized.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting there was also an issue regarding an IRS ruling mandated that A.S. Program Board staff get paid through stipend instead of via honoraria.</p>\n<p>Chairman of the Senate’s Finance and Business Committee Jimmy Villarreal said the IRS does not believe the work A.S. Program Board does mandates an honoraria-based salary and that A.S. needs to change the way they are paid.</p>\n<p>“The fact that they have staff that directly supervises them … Program Board is one of the few [groups] that actually has a staff and supervision,” Villarreal said. “So for those reasons and others, the IRS doesn’t want them to be paid through honoraria. Instead we’re going to pay them through stipend, or at least that’s the idea right now.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said there needs to be a change in A.S. Legal Code language regarding how payment is issued to students in student government.</p>\n<p>“I’m actually going to ask some senators … to draft new language for the bylaws to instruct that we are actually managers of our own time and resources,” Guthy said. “That’s a big confusion for the IRS, as they are under the assumption that for stipend-earning students, that we have a staff supervisor.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, although the IRS disagrees, A.S.’s independence justifies the continuation of their specialized honoraria-based salaries.</p>\n<p>“That’s the completely amazing thing about student government is, we are our own bosses and our own supervisors of our own time,” Guthy said. “We don’t report to a staff member.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the Program Board stipend issue, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said she is looking to further discuss how to pay students in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I am in the middle of a conversation with execs and finance board … to discuss the budget process as well as a new element, which is the stipend class of students,” Marquez said. “We’ll be discussing that a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh also talked about what his office is working on in the coming months, including events and campaigns like Gaucho Consent, which will help educate students about sexual violence. Singh said his office will possibly host a Red My Lips Campaign to bring awareness to sexual assault awareness month in April.</p>\n<p>“The idea is combating the slut-shaming that goes on in regards to gender-based violence,” Singh said. “Basically women are invited to wear red lipstick all week or all month to kind of counter that image.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, January 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/","id":2994,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2993,2992,2991],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting included debate on a bill that would change the responsibilities of the Student Advocate General, a visit from UCPD’s Lt. Mark Signa and a speaker on the place of art in Isla Vista. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A room in the UCen to discuss issues including the proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” and heard questions regarding police policies for this upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” seeks to create a new advocacy unit to deal with individual students’ needs, a service the SAG currently performs. UCSB Police Department Lt. Mark Signa also answered questions from senators about police policies in I.V. this Halloween, including restrictions on vehicle traffic.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology double major and A.S. President Ali Guthy, the bill would remove the casework aspects of the work done by SAG.</p>\n<p>“The bill is a structural change,” Guthy said. “It has no effect on the SAG’s ability to select their staff, it just removes their casework component.”</p>\n<p>Guthy defended the proposal and cited the A.S. Legal Code as a reason for separating the casework and outreach responsibilities of the SAG.</p>\n<p>“The constitution does not demand that the SAG perform casework,” Guthy said. “They’re supposed to educate the student body on these resources, and then they’re also doing casework, which is not listed in the constitution.”</p>\n<p>Former Student Advocate General and third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected last Spring and abdicated the position in early September, said that SAG workers’ viewpoints should be considered and discussed as well as the possible issues with forming a new advocacy unit. Loverin said those present lacked any experience in the position of SAG and raised concerns about maintaining confidentiality in the proposed new unit.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous that this is even being considered,” Loverin said. “Did you know that anyone entering that office [as SAG] has to sign a non-disclosure agreement worth half a million dollars to maintain confidentiality? That becomes a huge risk when you have a unit doing this. How are you going to maintain confidentiality?”</p>\n<p>The bill will be discussed further in future meetings and a senate vote has not yet been held.</p>\n<p>Signa was present at the senate meeting as a representative of the UCPD and discussed police policies for the upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Michelle Moreh asked whether or not identification would be required to enter I.V. this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen a sign near campus saying you may need to provide proof of residency to be able to come into Isla Vista during a certain time period…” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Signa said no such policies would be in place this weekend. According to Signa, the only areas facing restrictions on vehicle traffic will be the 6500, 6700 and 6800 blocks of Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road.</p>\n<p>Signa also said the police strategy to maintain peace this weekend includes an effort to keep crowds moving to prevent tensions from rising and fights from breaking out.</p>\n<p>“The goal is not to go out there and write a lot of tickets. The goal is to keep the streets going and moving back and forth,” Signa said. “When the crowd stops there’s a serious concern there that the crowd will bunch up and when people get really crowded in there, they’ve been tense, they’ve been intoxicated, they get aggressive and fights start breaking out. That’s the same reason we don’t want cars on Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>According to Signa, he enjoys working in the community, although certain segments make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p>“I love working here, I love Isla Vista, I love the community, I love the university,” Signa said. “The struggle with Isla Vista is you have such a diverse population and I don’t want to point fingers at any group but City College unfortunately has a reputation of having a lot of kids there for partying. If that’s their only goal, it’s hard to change that.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kim Yasuda from the art dept. also spoke briefly to the senate about recent public art demonstrations in I.V. and the importance of developing I.V. as an artistic community.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like Isla Vista is ripe for a creative incubator where students could engage in projects,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. could be made safer not only by increasing security, but also increasing public art. As an example, Yasuda broached the possibility of public lighting in the form of art installations.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I want to say is enforcement is certainly important for safety, but there’s also engagement, and I think the arts could bring the engagement piece in partnership with the enforcement piece to bring a really safe environment,” Yasuda said. “Public lighting doesn’t have to be security lights or surveillance cameras; It can be beautiful, magical lighting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Xin Ma was also sworn in at the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-senate-talks-sag-responsibilities-halloween-protocols/","id":2995,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2994,2993,2992],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
