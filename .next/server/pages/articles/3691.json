Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements.  </span><em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to waive the requirement for the upcoming school year was made in light of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, according to the resolution’s first author, On-Campus Senator Gurleen Pabla, who spoke during the Wednesday night Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are five on-campus senators for the 2020-21 school year: Senator Pabla, Senator Adam Bagul, Senator Anusikha Halder, Senator Dania De Ramon and Senator Taylor Tait, who seconded the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of us are aware how we don’t know how we’re going to move forward with housing and school in general,” Pabla said. “A lot of people are going to have a lot of restrictions moving forward, whether it be housing in general or financial problems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not even apply to some of us senators — but there are others that have constrictions that we should be aware of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tait added during the meeting that this is a “unique situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Housing is very up in the air. There’s no confirmed statement [from the university.] It’s unfair to expect all of our senators to have on-campus housing when it’s not really up to them how they can live, especially when you factor in social distancing, spreading our dorms and all the [approaches]that housing is going to take for our safety and health,” Tait said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the May University of California Board of Regents meeting, UC President Janet Napolitano </span><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2020/05/uc-regents-fall-2020-budget-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the UC system would make a decision regarding the state of Fall Quarter 2020 in mid-June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, Interim Student Health Service Medical Director Ali Javanbakht </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told the Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that UCSB is considering offering only singles and doubles in residence halls next year. However, he also said there’s concern among Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group that this could mean a shortage of beds and push more people into I.V. during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The on-campus housing requirement — a part of A.S. Legal Code — has long been a subject of debate on the Senate table. Typically, the Senate does not have the power to waive the requirement, as the requirements for senators are in the A.S. Constitution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The California state government supersedes A.S. Legal Code. Seeing as how this is an unforeseen circumstance, and given that the state is under executive order from the Governor, it is up to the Senate to accommodate and be responsive, as necessary,” Barth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators technically do not have the power to waive those requirements within the confines of our student government, but the state layer of governance is supreme, in this case. The Senate is doing the best they can to adapt to our current situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate will resume its regular meetings during Fall Quarter 2020. It is unknown at this time whether those meetings will be held in person or over Zoom, as they have been for spring quarter.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Like all S.A.G. candidates in the past, he is not affiliated with any party and is running as an independent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) aids students accused of violating the University Code of Student Conduct and advocates for any changes to be made for a fairer policy. The OSA is a non-partisan executive branch within UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student Advocate General] requires a lot of compassion.

However, when asked about his past involvement with the OSA, he stated he had “zero experience” in the office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a job I’ve never done before. And so that’s why I really want to be, throughout this entire year, is [be] honest with my students, with my constituents,” he said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how I’m going to do this job, but [based] off my experience as an off-campus senator this year, I can tell you at the very least, I’m excited.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he plans to increase awareness and improve the image of the OSA through two ways: social media and physical presence. He noted that being active on social media platforms to spread information and establishing a physical campus presence through tabling and door-to-door operations are key to making the OSA a trustworthy, compassionate and welcoming space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he plans to continue a project left behind by Jack Tannenbaum, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-s-a-g-jack-tannenbaum/\">the 2017-2018 Student Advocate General.</a> Tannenbaum’s project focused on a poll that would be used to collect data at the end of elections on what students are most concerned about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen wants to improve upon the poll by sending it out in the middle of the year through G.O.L.D. and carrying out door-to-door operations in order to work on initiatives earlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also emphasized his understanding of the boundaries between confidentiality and transparency, stating that confidentiality is needed when dealing with student cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy for people to take an oath to be confidential, but I believe that those words and those oaths only take a real shape when someone understands the impact it has on the people around them. And that’s something I believe I’ve really internalized,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he prioritizes the safety of students. He added that the first step to combat threats of anti-Semitism and sexual harassment is to believe and listen to victims, and to work collaboratively with these groups in order to prioritize students’ safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope to be a beacon of inspiration for people to do more than what is at their most immediate inte</span>rest, their most convenient interest.”</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.
