The talk ended with a free book signing in honor of Litchtblau’s latest book entitled <em>The Nazis Next Door</em>, which took place at the entrance of Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>According to Lichblau, despite the American populous’ opposition to aiding Nazis, U.S. intelligence agencies undertook various secret efforts to protect them once they got to American soil.</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that Nazis in America were paid with commodities for their work during what he called a “horribly difficult truth” in American history.</p>\n<p>“They were perceived as lazy, filthy, thieves, liars and double agents,” Lichtblau said. “But, they were still used by the U.S. in times of war and were offered packs of cigarettes and alcohol in return.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969 – Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Lichtblau</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lichtblau, the living conditions of Nazis in America were “shameful” because they were “easily” allowed to live in the U.S. while their Jewish victims “horribly” suffered in concentration camps.</p>\n<p>“The ease of allowing Nazis in America, in my view, is shameful and is a really untold period in postwar history as thousands of Nazis came to America after the war,” Lichtblau said. “It was horribly easy for them to come and horribly difficult for the liberation of Jews in America. I cringe at this sight.”</p>\n<p>Lichtblau said that although Nazi scientists aided American scientists in developing technology to go the moon in 1969, their cooperation with the government is considered “horrible.”</p>\n<p>“Nazi scientists clearly brought technological advantages to the U.S. by giving us a leg up on the Soviets to reach the moon in 1969,” Lichtblau said, “Without them, we realistically might not have entered the moon in 1969,”</p>\n<p>Litchblau also said that there were a few “good” spies that helped the U.S. perform tasks that they could not accomplish on their own.</p>\n<p>“There were some good Nazi spies that translated documents, control zones of Europe, intercepting cables, and doing other tasks that the U.S. could not do themselves,” Litchblau said, “Some of these were anti-Soviet spies whom were rewarded.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S. I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong. – First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Litchblau, the anticommunist sentiments shared by the U.S. and Nazis in America allowed Americans to channel anticommunist Nazi sentiment into work.</p>\n<p>“Anticommunists sentiments were behind the Nazi achievements because the U.S. was against communism and this helped,” Litchblau said. “There was a notion that nobody hated the Soviets more than the Nazis and the U.S. wanted to put this hatred to work.”</p>\n<p>First-year religious studies major Kevin Jim said he was alarmed that Nazis were secretly protected by the American government and that the actions of the intelligence agencies “feels gross.”</p>\n<p>“I would never have imagined that Hitler’s men would be offered work in the U.S.,” Jim said. “I always thought that the U.S. never favored Nazi ideals or people during postwar times, and I am wrong.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Ashley Miller however said Lichtblau’s talk changed her previously held perspectives on Nazis.</p>\n<p>“Currently knowing that Nazis aided Americans with scientific and spy-related achievements, it helps me to see them as a little less worse than I previously thought of them,” Miller said. “It is mind-blowing to have my perspective change.”</p>\n<p>Psychology professor Kristen Macuga said she was “quite shocked” to learn about Operation Paperclip, since she grew up in the post Pearl Harbor-era where the U.S. was portrayed as heroic in the post-World War II historical narrative.</p>\n<p>“It is quite shocking to know this,” Macuga said. “I was born weeks after Pearl Harbor in a place that made it seem that Americans were heroes who freed Jews from concentration camps. It is shocking to know that we allowed Nazis to aid us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

transmitted infections worldwide in order to promote local advocacy and action.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and residential assistant Saxon Cropper is hosting the event with help from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbosl\">the Office of Student Life</a> Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, UCSB After Dark, Housing and Community Living, Pacific Pride, Queer Student Union (QSU) and Black Student Union (BSU). Yesterday featured a discussion with Pacific Pride about advancements in HIV/AIDS, and today will include a student dialogue with QSU related to HIV/AIDS and sex traffic workers. Wednesday involves a campus-wide action to wear all black, and on Friday free and discrete HIV/AIDS testing will be provided in De Anza Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and BSU member Ricky Barajas said the overall goal of this week is to support QSU and address HIV/AIDS as a significant issue affecting both the LGBTQ+ community and the black community.</p>\n<p>“I think that it is very important to recognize the intersections between race and sexuality, because black people account for 12 percent of the population, but over 40 percent of infected people are black,” Barajas said. “BSU supports this event because of how our community is disproportionately affected, and also because we want to stand in solidarity with other organizations and people who are striving to educate and advocate for people affected by this issue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference. – Event host Saxon Cropper</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cropper said the weeklong event is meant to send a reminder that HIV/AIDS is an issue that impacts everyone within an afflicted community, both directly and indirectly.</p>\n<p>“My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference,” Cropper said. “We can learn to be more sensitive and finally learn to protect ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Cropper, because there is social stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and a general lack of education on about it on campus, organizations hosting the event aim to eliminate the stigma and offer accurate information about it on campus.</p>\n<p>“By social stigma, I mean that within spaces, people have made HIV a social taboo,” Cropper said. “People should know that HIV is not a death sentence and that there are people living with HIV who are living healthy lives.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS. – First-year economics major Derrick Duren</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies major and QSU co-chair Roger Gonzalez said the event provides an opportunity for the university to support victims of HIV/AIDS in addition to participating in the annual AIDS walk.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara has an annual AIDS walk, but UCSB doesn’t have anything to do with it so it’s important especially for college students because it’s important for us to be aware of it on our campus and help out those who do have HIV or AIDS,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics major Derrick Duren, the campus benefits from events like the HIV/AIDS Awareness Week because it supports community members who struggle with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<p>“This AIDS Awareness Week will be an amazing way to enlighten our student body to the reality of living with STIs,” Duren said. “Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Some of the committees on campus that were reported on include the Arts &amp; Lectures Advisory Committee, the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Health Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some changes being discussed include the possibility of the Student Resource Building (SRB) Governance Board renaming the SRB to honor retiring Vice Chancellor Michael D. Young. Other changes include the Student Health Advisory Committee’s upcoming notice to students that next year the distance criteria for Gaucho Health Insurance will be extended to include Kaiser Permanente patients within 50 miles, and that the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Student Housing will release a report of a delay in the opening of the San Joaquin apartment projects.</p>\n<p>Cassie Mancini, second-year history of public policy major and chair of the Senate University Affairs Committee, said Gaucho Health Insurance was a big issue that many students discussed during meetings.</p>\n<p>“The limits of the distance requirement — that’s so prevalent,” Mancini said. “That was such a big issue and I know our committee reps have been pushing for it, so that’ll be good.”<br>\nMancini said another important issue for students concerns work currently being done by the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on the Status of Women and their student representative Danielle Maldonado.</p>\n<p>“Promotion of women and ensuring faculty and professors get promoted as often as men do and increasing women of color faculty on this campus, that’s a great issue that she’s [Maldonado] really pushing for,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, this was the first time A.S. published a shared governance report, in an effort to hold student representatives accountable and to spread the word on new things that are occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the report can be beneficial for students to know what is happening within administrative and advisory committees on campus.</p>\n<p>“Often there is only one student representative or voice in these spaces, and student participation is critical to fulfilling the mission of shared governance on our campus and throughout the UC system,” Guthy said in an email. “This report is a fantastic new way of ensuring student representation and awareness in all of these spaces.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said shared governance describes the collaborative efforts that are being made between students and staff on campus.</p>\n<p>“The faculty and administrators of the school and students, as well, sharing in university governance and policy-making,” Mancini said. “It’s kind of a concept very unique to the UC system … At the core, it’s like this real sharing of duties between administrators and faculty and we’ve kind of come to have students work with that too.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the report was compiled using feedback provided by student representatives who sit on different committees that were appointed by the A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>“We ask the students to be really critical of everything that’s said in the committee and make sure they’re sharing the student perspective because oftentimes in these committees there’s only one student there,” Mancini said. “So it’s super important that the students engage with the committee and really become a member of it to kind of share their voice in the committee.”</p>\n<p>Eve Kopecky, second-year English major and Shared Governance Coordinator for the Committee on Committees, said office hours will be held by the different committees and their representatives at the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center for students who have any questions about what is occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to get up and going and started to be more proactive about shared governance,” Kopecky said. “So we’re really excited that everyone’s going to have their office hours and be able to just inform people, who they are and what they do.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A copy of the A.S.

The event will be hosted by Santa Barbara Hacks, a student organization and is sponsored by Citrix, Cisco, Opengov, Microsoft, Intel, Smartstones and Major League Hacking, among others. SB Hacks is co-founded by fourth-year computer science majors Trevor Frese and Anshul Jain as well as third-year computer science major Benji Lampel.</p>\n<p>Geared towards undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students, the event is free for all participants and will provide participating hackers with free meals. Students with advanced knowledge in computing as well as beginners can attend the event and participants can attend in groups of up to four individuals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing. Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill. – SB Hacks co-founder and fourth-year computer science major Anshul Jain</p></blockquote>\n<p>Frese said the Hackathon will include smaller events to highlight the “Santa Barbara vibe,” such as morning yoga sessions and walks to the beach.</p>\n<p>“There’s a big focus in Santa Barbara on health and wellness as well, so that has been one of our focuses of the event,” Frese said. “Although it is a 36-hour event and it’s stressful for the hackers, we want them to have the right means to stay healthy. We’ve also just added a lot of activities to the event. We have video game tournaments, silent disco and a moonlight walk on the beach.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the team with the most creative and original project at the showcase will win the Grand Prize Bundle, which includes the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 and a $10,000 cash prize. Prizes will also be awarded to the winning groups in various challenges, such as Environmental Hack Challenge, Beginners Hack Challenge and Makeschool Best iOS App/Game Challenge.</p>\n<p>“Some groups work on challenges that they work on assigned by companies, while others come together to work on their own project that you’ve just never had the chance to make,” Lampel said. “At its heart it’s still a competition, and people are still there to compete for prizes. People are still trying to work on something to win, but there are a lot of ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The hackathon will give students the opportunity to develop ideas that they previously had not had the opportunity to create, Jain said.</p>\n<p>“You get to spend the weekend working on something awesome and building that one idea that you just had floating around in your head for months and just hadn’t got around to developing,” Jain said. “Something you’ve always wanted to try or just test your limits on a new skill.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun. – SB Hacks co-founder and third-year computer science major Benji Lampel</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon will allow student groups to get critique and assistance from mentors hired by the company sponsors as well as to “meld brains with people we would never have met otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“Lots of companies will send mentors who specialize in certain systems,” Lampel said. “Because computer science is such a broad field of so many specific areas of study, it’s hard to teach someone one thing and say they are proficient computer scientists.”</p>\n<p>According to Lampel, the hackathon is open to individuals with advanced knowledge in coding as well as to those with no previous experience in the field.</p>\n<p>“There are people who come to these events to learn how to code and we think that UCSB Hacks is definitely a great place for beginners to come and learn and meet people who are very experienced in the industry,” Lampel said, “but then have the opportunity to work with them also in a very safe cooperative learning environment.”</p>\n<p>Lampel said the hackathon aims to highlight Santa Barbara as a location “on the map” of the tech industry as well as to show that it is “just how we do things here.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of starter communities in L.A., San Francisco, Silicone Valley and they’re all very big . . . I think the start-up community in SB is very different from the other places,” Lampel said. “We want to showcase that working here, whether you’re in college or in the industry, is totally worthwhile and amazingly fun.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/sb-hacks-to-host-first-annual-coding-competition-on-campus/","id":2928,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2927,2926,2925],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
