however, in recent years it has become even more universal.</p>\n<p>While mid-major athletics programs have been around for decades, the reality of the growing stardom of Power 5 conferences has resulted in the gradual dwarfing of these less prestigious schools.</p>\n<p>Similar to many other mid-major programs, UCSB tends to find itself being overlooked within the college sports realm.</p>\n<p>Surely, attractions such as the beach and academics are influential upon UCSB receiving attention amongst the masses.</p>\n<p>They’re even features that help to recruit prospective athletes as well.</p>\n<p>While both are enticing, the lack of having what many would consider a “big name” on the college sports map certainly is a challenge that affects UCSB both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>As a sports fan, the image of attending a game in which the arena or stadium bleachers are filled to capacity was an experience I hoped for.</p>\n<p>Of course, once I submitted my Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) for UCSB, which gives you a sense of how nerve-wracking the recruiting process must be for student-athletes, it was quickly evident that my vision was unlikely to occur.</p>\n<p>Let’s face facts.</p>\n<p>As we all know UCSB, is not a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>Not to dismiss the record-breaking attendance numbers for UCSB men’s soccer matches versus Blue-Green rival Cal Poly or even when the Gauchos go head-to-head with the Mustangs in men’s basketball, but the occurrence of these contests occurring twice per season for both sports just isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>Excluding those who follow UCSB sports, many students are even unaware that our school has Division I status.</p>\n<p>In an era of college sports when the destinations of some of the nation’s five-star, McDonald’s All-American and ESPN Top 300 athletes are plastered and glamorized in storylines nationwide, UCSB isn’t home to much of that glitz and glamour.</p>\n<p>But this is what makes UCSB sports special.</p>\n<p>Simply put, it’s the little things that go a long way and speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>While currently in the middle of my fourth year, the chance to observe the accomplishments of different teams has been a wonderful process to witness.</p>\n<p>These accomplishments have been achieved by teams such as men’s soccer, which nearly upset No. 2 seeded Clemson in the Sweet 16 back in 2015.</p>\n<p>This was followed by baseball’s ‘Chomaha’ College World Series run after upsetting No. 2 seeded Louisville in 2016. Along with those two, 2016 also became the year the women’s water polo team won its first Big West tournament title in program history.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, nobody can take away the fact that you’re a winner, regardless of the scale that success took place on.</p>\n<p>Each of the aforementioned wins are UCSB’s own version of “Cinderella” stories, forever cemented in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>UCSB has two national championships in its history — the first by its 1979 UCSB men’s water polo team and the last by its men’s soccer team over UCLA in the 2006 Men’s College Cup.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell what’s in store for UCSB sports in the coming years. Hey, who knows, maybe UCSB’s opportunity to host the 2018 and 2020 Men’s College Cups will bring about some extra motivation and mojo that results in another title for the Gaucho faithful.</p>\n<p>As a senior, I won’t physically be here for that future.</p>\n<p>However, the underdog nature of UCSB sports will always stick with me, and of course, I’ll continue to follow each sport’s success year in and year out in hopes of a big run.</p>\n<p>In the case of mid-major programs like UCSB’s, there’s added motivation to surpass the usually underestimated standard that is placed on them.</p>\n<p>With that being said, the Power 5 conferences may have the better talent according to rankings and other measureables.</p>\n<p>But heart and effort can’t be measured. And those are two things that will always outperform talent.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

<em>Courtesy of Adam Chohan</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student-run coffee company, known as Quokka Brew, was created at UC Berkeley and is now expanding to other campuses across California. As president of the Quokka Brew Ambassador Program at UCSB, fourth-year chemical engineering major Adam Chohan said he is helping expand the brew to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chohan said he first heard about Quokka Brew from UC Berkeley students Ofek Arush and George Passantino, who realized they needed caffeine during finals week in 2018 but found that the anxious jitters and excessive sugar that come with coffee weren’t worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-founders then formulated the idea for an ideal brew that would be an effective energizer and healthier alternative to traditional brews. They soon after consulted with chemists and food scientists in the Bay Area to craft this into a reality, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five months later, Quokka Brew was being distributed in 4-ounce glass bottles around the Berkeley and San Francisco area — marked with a beaming quokka, a small marsupial similar in size to a cat. Containing 15 calories, 1 gram of sugar and almond milk, Quokka Brew is currently the healthiest non-black coffee on the market, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chohan, the science surrounding Quokka Brew’s effectiveness revolves around the circulatory system, where some coffee drinkers experience caffeine’s infamous jitters.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Caffeine normally restricts your veins, so less blood pumping through the circulatory system causes the heart to start pumping harder and counteract that, which is where the jitters and anxiety arise from,” Chohan explained. “The amino acids in [the Quokka] blend act as vasodilators which dilate the veins so blood flows through the circulatory system with the same caffeine intake.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of Quokka Brew — to provide the benefits of caffeine without its negative side effects — was initially ridiculed as an impossible feat but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining, Chohan said. The brew is sold in 10 stores across the Bay Area and is backed by a team of 46 students at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the company transitions into its second year of production, it continues to expand to college campuses across the state, including Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Sacramento State and now UCSB. Across each campus, the company tables, creates ambassador programs and works to get the product sold in nearby stores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps we are taking here are very similar to the steps that UC Berkeley took but they are happening a lot quicker because the response has been really awesome. I think mostly it is because people are very friendly here and students are eager to support student-run business models,” Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While popularity grows on campus, the company is looking forward to making some pivotal adjustments including using a fair-trade coffee roaster and transitioning to aluminum cans. The brew is currently only available at Sam’s To Go in I.V., but Chohan said they hope to soon sell Quokka Brew at the UCen, the Arbor and the Corner Store on campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buildings that have now fallen below UC standards are in a level VI category, which is labeled by the UCSB Design, Facilities &amp; Safety Services website as a high priority for correction. These buildings are the Chemistry and Biochemistry Building, Ellison Hall, Music Building, Phelps Hall, San Miguel Towers and San Nicolas Towers, according to the campus-wide email sent out by Garry Mac Pherson, vice chancellor for administrative administrative services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, 99 campus buildings or portions of those buildings have a rating of V, meaning they will require a “second, more thorough evaluation, and any confirmed seismic deficiencies will be addressed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Mac Pherson’s email, engineers have been reevaluating the UCSB campus since 2018 based on new guidelines. The retrofitting and upgrading of buildings is expected to be completed by 2030, according to the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As new science and technology become available, building codes are modified to incorporate advances in best practices and continually enhance building safety,” Mac Pherson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the 1970s, the University of California has been a leader both in seismic-structure research and in developing seismic policies and standards to address the risks that earthquakes pose,” Mac Pherson said in the email. “UC has set its standards for seismic safety higher than those associated with state and local building codes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with the extra precautions taken by the University of California, earthquakes still pose a risk. According to the California Earthquake Authority, there is a </span><a href=\"https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/California-Earthquake-Risk/Faults-By-County?c=santa-barbara\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% chance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of at least one earthquake occurring in Southern California with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus will begin undergoing building upgrades in summer 2021, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Campus leadership is actively working on developing the schedule and sequencing of our seismic retrofit program to align with UC seismic safety policy. Currently for our housing facilities, the goal is to schedule the seismic retrofit projects over the summer months, when they are least likely to impact our student residents and occupancy rates,” Estrada said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plans for the upgrades are not yet complete, so it is not known what aspects of UCSB life will be affected yet. Estrada also expressed that it is unclear what will need to be repaired in order to maintain the high building rating.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30,
