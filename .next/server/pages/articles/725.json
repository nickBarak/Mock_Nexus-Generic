These two losses drop the team to 2-6 after a string of four straight losses.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Gauchos traveled to USC to take on one of the top teams in the nation, one that could very likely win the NCAA championship this year. The Gauchos lost the doubles point again, with losses from doubles pairs junior Ziad Sultan and senior Sasha Gryaznov as well as junior Tobias Galskov and junior Miles Seemann. The third doubles pair made up of freshmen Teague Hamilton and Erik Johnsson put in a great effort as the pair was tied 7-7 with USC’s freshmen Nick Crystal and Rob Bellamy before they ended their match as the other two double match losses decided the doubles point in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fare any better in singles against the Trojans, as all six matches went to USC with the Gauchos not winning a single set. Sultan worked hard to send his second set against senior No. 7 Ray Sarmiento, but eventually lost 6-1, 7-6 (4).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moving on to their match against Fresno State yesterday afternoon, the Gauchos lost the doubles point on two matches won by the Bulldogs. Yet Galskov/Seemann won their doubles match 8-3 over senior Sam MacNeil and freshman Alexandros Georgios.</p>\n<p>This marked the sixth match in a row the Gauchos lost the double point and it ultimately coming back to haunt them in the 4-3 loss. The team will certainly look to improve with conference matches in the very near future.</p>\n<p>In singles, Hamilton defeated freshman John Darmstaedter 6-3, 6-0 in the fifth position, giving the Gauchos their first victory. Finishing next were Gryaznov and Sultan’s matches in quick succession with Gryaznov losing to freshman Erik Komati 7-5, 6-1 and Sultan losing to MacNeil 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Galskov played a fantastic match in the number one position, his first time playing there this season. He lost the first set, but came back to win the next two, winning the match over junior Sai Kartik Nakireddi 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. Galskov’s win gave the Gauchos a chance for victory with two matches remaining in the overall battle as the team was already down 3-1.</p>\n<p>“I thought we wasted a heroic performance from Tobias,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “Coming back from 5-4 down in the third [set] against a quality guy at No. 1, that was a hell of a battle. It was physical and I felt [Tobias] did most of the work. I’m really proud of Toby’s effort.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then looked to Seemann and Johnsson, needing both players to win their individual matches. Seemann looked to have his match against freshman Ethan Lopez wrapped up after winning the first set 6-4 and leading in the second set 4-0 while Johnsson had lost the first set 6-2 to sophomore Nikolas Papic yet was battling in the second. With both teams’ players looking on, Johnsson had a 5-4 lead over Papic, but could not finish the set with Papic coming back to win it 7-5 and leading the Bulldogs to victory while Seemann won his match 6-4, 6-1 as merely a consolation prize.</p>\n<p>“Teague played his best match of his Gaucho career so far,” Davis said. “Miles had a nice debut, so kudos to those guys but, I’m hugely disappointed overall. We just aren’t accustomed to losing at home and we’ve done it twice already this season, so I’m not too happy with things overall, but we did have a couple good performances today.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will move on from this weekend looking to more possible lineup changes with the move of Galskov to No. 1 working as he won on Sunday. The team hosts Nevada State on Friday and Pacific on Sunday, looking to change its losing ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-drop-two-this-weekend/","id":725,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[724,723,722],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss","biography":"Not available","articles":[172,174,176,177,187,188,193,195,197,198,212,213,214,216,233,235,412,525,725,748,779,801,804,2029,2038,3286,4901,5013,5026,5042,5063,5064,5068,5069,5101,5102,5103,5106,5124,5125,5126,5137,5141,5142,5143,5144,5145,5146,5147,5148,5149,5150,5183,5185,5186,5187,5190,5191,5310,5315,5318,5319,5320,5321,5322,5323,5338,5339,5341,5346],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Big West Champs Ready to Begin Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its quest for a second consecutive Big West title this Monday when it begins its season in an exhibition match against Vanguard.

The team led the Big West in scoring defense, allowing just 52.5 points per game. With Mitchell behind the wheel, the personality of this team will remain the same. Now, the players have a better feel for the system, but what plagued the Gauchos last season was the ability to score, so if they can cut down on their mistakes and put some points on the board, their defense will always keep them in games.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Despite losing two incredible seniors in Emilie Johnson, the team’s leading scorer and point guard, and Kelsey Adrian, the team’s leading three-point threat known for her versatility, the Gauchos have a similar look to last year’s team that took the Big West crown. The team features eight returning players, including three starters.</span></span></span></span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Here’s a breakdown of this year’s squad:</span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Guards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Nicole Nesbit (junior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — Last year, Nesbit came off the bench as a solid point guard. This year, the team is hers. Nesbit has the ability get to the basket and create her own shot or create for others. She also developed a nice jumper off the dribble. Last season, Nesbit was the team’s second leading scorer (behind Johnson ) at 8.2 points per game and gave fans a glimpse of what she’s capable offensively when she tallied a career high 20 points in the semifinal game of the Big West tournament against Pacific. She also averaged 2.2 assists last season, second on the team. This season, Mitchell will look for consistency from her upperclassman.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Melissa Zornig (junior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Zornig caught fire during the Big West playoffs last year, averaging 16.7 points. She set a career high against Pacific with 23 points and her efforts were rewarded as she was named to the All-Tournament Team. Zornig’s role on this year’s team will primarily be as a scorer. With a high basketball IQ, the ability to attack the rim, and a solid three point shot, Zornig should easily improve on her 6.8 points per game she set last season. Shooting 30.9 percent from behind the arc last season, second to only Adrian, expect Zornig to be the team’s main three point threat too. However, Zornig will also take on some of the point guard responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Destini Mason (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> A starter last season, Mason is known for her defense and will be expected to guard the other team’s best guard night in and night out. She has great athletic ability, allowing her to create for others. She also has a solid midrange jump shot. According to Mitchell, Mason has improved immensely since we last saw her, playing much calmer. She has even become a leader on this team, taking the freshmen under her wing. While Mason’s contributions may not always show up in the box scores, her opponents always feel her defensive presence.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Angelei Aguirre (senior)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — We have yet to see the best of Aguirre, as she spent the majority of last season out with an injury. However, Mitchell gives Aguirre the most credit for leading the Gauchos to the championship. Aguirre is the team’s most versatile player, offensively and defensively, and has the ability to play positions one through four. Offensively, she can hit the 15-foot jumper and has the ball handling skills to even play point guard. Aguirre’s greatest strength on the offensive end, though, may be her passing. However, UCSB will need Aguirre to put some points on the board. Defensively, Aguirre will share the responsibilities with Mason of guarding the other team’s best player.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Madeline Campbell (sophomore)</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> — As a freshman, Campbell saw limited minutes last year. However, Campbell is a hard worker who can play in multiple positions for UCSB since she has good size at six feet. When she plays, Mitchell will need her to have an attack mentality and get to rim or the free throw line. With her size, Campbell also serves as a great offensive option to post up smaller guards. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jasmine Ware (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Ware is another taller guard at 5’10’’ who Mitchell compared to Mason, with her high energy and defensive stopper mentality. Offensively, Ware owns the midrange game and will fit well into the system. Mitchell even called her on the level of a sophomore. So, despite being a freshman, expect Ware to make an impact on the team, especially as the team heads into conference.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Forwards</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Sweets Underwood (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Also a starter last season, Underwood is an extremely athletic player capable of averaging a double-double every game for UCSB. Last season, Underwood averaged 7.7 points and 7 rebounds, good enough for sixth in the Big West. She also shot a high field goal percentage, ranking third in the Big West at 46.9 percent. Underwood owns a quick 15-foot jump shot, but can also post up, which is important in UCSB’s offense, where the four and five positions are interchangeable. As for improvement, Mitchell looks to see Underwood continue to develop her passing, but overall, Underwood is a huge piece of the puzzle for UCSB.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jackie Luna-Castro (sophomore) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> While Luna-Castro is listed as a forward, she played center for UCSB last year, which probably won’t change. Last season, fans saw sparks of great potential in the young freshman, like in the Cal Poly game when she earned the start. Over the offseason, Luna-Castro has worked on her strength, but what Mitchell most hopes to see from Luna- Castro is consistency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Kendra Morrison (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Similar to Adrian from last season, Morrison is 6’1’’ and another versatile player. In her time at UCSB so far, Morrison has surprised Mitchell, who said she is “better than I thought with her IQ.” Morrison is a great passer who can also post up. Stronger than Adrian, Morrison isn’t afraid to mix it up more. Expect this freshman to find minutes on the floor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Centers</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong> Kirsten Tilleman (senior) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Known as a blue-collar player, Tilleman was a huge highlight last season for UCSB. As Mitchell has repeatedly stated, “we go as Tilleman goes.” As a starter, she was consistently known for her defensive play, ranking second in the Big West in rebounds at 8.4 per game and seventh in blocked shots at .9. Offensively, Tilleman is the ultimate team player and team’s best post passer. But, Tilleman became a legitimate scoring threat down the stretch of the season, averaging 9.75 points in the final 12 games. She takes advantage of the 17-foot jump shot. Playing the majority of the time on the low block last year, the Gauchos would like to take greater advantage of Tilleman’s outside game. She’s worked on leading more vocally, but Tilleman is the leader of this team.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">\n</p><p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Jessica Pino (freshman) —</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Thus far, Pino has made her mark on the Gauchos as a hard worker and a great passer who can also shoot the 17-foot jump shot. Pino’s greatest, though, may be her size. At 6’3’’, Pino brings height to a team that was considered undersized all of last season. The Gauchos will look for Pino to be effective on the low block.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-30/big-west-champs-ready-season/","id":722,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[721,720,719],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tames Lions in Exhibition Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It won’t count for the record, but the UCSB women’s basketball team earned a 52-39 exhibition win over Vanguard in its first game of the 2012-13 season The Gauchos looked solid for playing its fir...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It won’t count for the record, but the UCSB women’s basketball team earned a 52-39 exhibition win over Vanguard in its first game of the 2012-13 season</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked solid for playing its first game of the year, shooting 43.4 percent from the field, almost double that of the Lions’ 22.4 percent.

Santa Barbara held Vanguard to 14-0 shooting to start the game and did not allow the Lions to score until the 10:17 mark.</p>\n<p>“That’s what we’re known for: the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “That’s what we expect from our kids.

With no established starting lineup entering the season, anyone can become the next star for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Point Guard</strong></p>\n<p>Lone senior Nate Garth and sophomore T.J. Taylor return after splitting time at the point last season. Garth (2.8 PPG, 2.4 APG) improved his shooting during the summer, a noticeable flaw in his game last season. Taylor (3.1 PPG, 1.8 APG), meanwhile, returns with his superb speed and ability to drive into the lane. Neither controlled the position last season, however, as Orlando Johnson ran the offense for the latter half of the year.</p>\n<p>Entering the fold are freshmen Dalante Dunklin and Duke DaRe. Dunklin brings a physical nature similar to Johnson’s, according to Head Coach Bob Williams, and will help the team tremendously with his tenacious perimeter defense. DaRe will see playing time as a fourth option at the point after coming to UCSB as a preferred walk-on.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know who is going to take the reins there; it’s an interesting battle,” Williams said. “We feel very comfortable about our point guard position. We think we have great depth, we have four players there who are going to play … so we feel pretty comfortable with that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Shooting Guard</strong></p>\n<p>Returning at guard for UCSB is sharp-shooting junior Kyle Boswell who shot .435 from behind the three-point line last season, good for third in the league. Boswell averaged 7.5 points per game and ranked fourth on the team in both points and minutes. Coming off the bench last season as the sixth man, Boswell was an integral part of the team, adding much-needed scoring off the bench.</p>\n<p>“We think right now, we probably have to start [Boswell] early,” Williams said. “Ultimately, we would love to be able to have the luxury of bringing him off the bench. He’s so good, such a spark, such a valuable player coming off the bench, but we have to wait and see.”</p>\n<p>True freshman Michael Bryson comes in as a talented recruit who can shoot and will likely spell Boswell at the two position, at least for the beginning of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to take some time. We’re going to have some patience to let this team grow up a little bit,” Williams said. “We’re the youngest team in the country. Between walk-ons and scholarship kids, we have 11 freshmen, and you need some patience to develop that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>After battling injuries for most of last season, junior Keegan Hornbuckle returns with a starting spot most likely in hand. Hornbuckle averaged 3.6 points last season but was inconsistent throughout the year, sometimes looking like a bench player while other moments like a star caliber player. He will likely split time between the small forward and power forward spot.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got to grow up. They have to go through their growing pains,” Williams said. “It’s not going to come out and be all smooth and a bed of roses early. There’s going to be ups and downs, we’re going to look good for four minutes and bad for four minutes.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Taran Brown will look to gain action on the floor for the first time this season with a strong chance at starting at the small forward spot. At 6’8”, Brown possesses the height for the power forward position but is a talented athlete and shooter better suited for perimeter play.</p>\n<p>“It’s the idea that we have to gradually be learning, and they have to be sponges and absorbing and putting into action what they absorb,” Williams said. “They’re a talented group, we’ve got good basketball players; it’s just a matter of growing up.”</p>\n<p>Coming off the bench will be Australian sophomore Lewis Thomas, who averaged 1.1 points and 1.3 rebounds per game last season. Thomas will fill in as a backup to Hornbuckle at the four position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Big Men</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the most recognized player returning for the Gauchos is sophomore center Alan Williams, who averaged 6.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season. Half of Williams’ rebounds were on the offensive end, as he led the Gauchos in rebounds despite playing only 17 minutes a game. Williams became a starter at the end of last season and is the leading candidate once again this season to lead the team in rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to utilize Al by setting good screens and [him] being a good rebounder,” Williams said. “We have to utilize him by getting him the ball on the right place on the floor where he can be effective. He has to do a good job of playing without fouling.”</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler will spell Williams at the center position while playing power forward as well. Brewe brings his 6’8”, 242-pound bruising frame into the low post for the Gauchos and is primarily an inside player.</p>\n<p>“It’s just important that they have a confidence level in teammates and they come out and play confident,” Williams said. “You can’t play scared in the game of basketball, and if you do, you’re going to get eaten up. All of these freshmen have had a pretty high level of success in high school, so they’re all pretty confident kids.”</p>\n<p>Beeler meanwhile is 6’10” but a mere 210 pounds. In his senior season of high school, Beeler averaged seven blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“The most pleasant surprise for us is the readiness of Mitch Brewe and the readiness of Sam Beeler,” Williams said. “We feel pretty comfortable if we have to play either one of them right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins play on Thursday, Nov. 1 in an exhibition game when they host La Verne College. Without a set starting lineup, Thursday’s game will give coaches and fans alike a good look at how the team performs and potentially who will step up in live-game situations.</p>\n<p>“We’ll run people in that game in waves to get a feel for what we have. There are so many new faces and so many new people that the idea of who starts really isn’t very important right now,” Williams said. “It’s us gaining information as coaches on our players whether or not we’re getting any better with what we’re trying to do. I anticipate there will be a lot of changing lineups with the first five to eight games.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season, UCSB was ranked fifth in the preseason conference poll, an homage to the team’s recent success, but also a realization that UCSB is no longer an unquestioned member at the top of the conference with the departure of the core group of seniors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair, a pretty good compliment to our recruiting,” Williams said. “In past years, teams that won the league were picked sixth in conference. So, get some chemistry, get gelled, who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for the La Verne game is scheduled for this Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-31/young-restless/","id":724,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[723,722,721],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
