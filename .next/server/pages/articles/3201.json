Students and faculty can search for open access online, use a inter-library loan or asking a librarian for more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Day in and day out, our librarians are finding content that’s behind paywalls, content that is out there that students, faculty [and] the UCSB community need to find,” Rick Stockwood, communications and marketing manager at the UCSB library, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone stumbles across a paywall like we all do almost everyday, trying to reach something, the librarians are here to help find that content.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Librarians at UC libraries are also able to purchase specific articles for access using the budget that would normally go to funding the contract with Elsevier, according to Antelman.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the library acquisition budget will also go to investing in open access initiatives elsewhere and working with a subcommittee of the Academic Senate to create a fund to facilitate open access of UC research articles, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC researchers have to pay an article processing charge to Elsevier in order to enable open access to their articles, which Antelman said usually costs around $3,000. This fund would help researchers cover this cost.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through the subscription dollars the library is currently paying, we would help subsidize those fees and they would be lower so that if the researcher wanted to publish open access, they would pay much less,” Antelman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The push for open access of UC research articles started in 2013 when the UC Academic Senate adopted a policy which iterated UC’s commitment to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible,” according to the official policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will soon sign onto an “</span><a href=\"https://oa2020.org/mission/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expression of Interest,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” according to Antelman, which asserts the importance of creating open access for research article and leaving the subscription model of the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UC signatories of the document include UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles and most recently UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC isn’t completely closing to door to Elsevier, however. UC still retains access to most articles from Elsevier before 2019 and room remains for more negotiations in the future, Antelman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hopeful that over time, Elsevier will possibly come back with another proposal and that we could possibly have a successful deal concluded, but at this point, it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I’m excited and honored to announce that tonight we can continue and uphold that legacy with some of the most radical organizers I know,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse urged students in attendance to support the hosts through Patreon, the content creator crowdfunding service, as few publicly funded resources exist for this kind of political education, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without the funds we really can’t be free and educate our people, which is something I really admire about their labor,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham, in his opening remarks, addressed the audience on his and Simons’ intention to establish a safe and inclusive space for the duration of their show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Definitely want to start by acknowledging this room is a safe space for all Black folks, we’re not free until all of us are free. If you’re not with that shit, y’all know where the exits are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham said he decided to start the podcast after graduating with a degree in journalism and spending a week with his mentor in New York, who was already a podcaster. He recalled being repulsed that the superficial commentary and focus on trivial issues by white men received obscenely high compensation, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All I seen was hella white men talking about shit that didn’t matter. It’s disgusting when you see how much white folks get paid for their bad ideas,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons called attention to their organization, the People’s Breakfast Oakland, stating that merely talking about Black issues was inadequate when people are not addressing material needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we engage in these communities that we claim to serve … what are you doing besides just talking about shit?” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tradition for the podcast, Parham and Simons began the night with their segment called “Black Joy,” where the co-hosts highlight a recent positive experience in their lives in-between episodes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A part of the Black burden is life being constantly born into the struggle, everything we do is politicized, everything we do gotta be serious [and] everything we do gotta be for liberation,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the reasons why we start the podcast [this way] is to center joy and having joy in the movement is important. Black joy, not that white shit, that hella Black joy,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons then addressed the contradiction of being an individual Black student charting their own educational path, particularly in a predominantly white institution, with the reality that the mass struggle of Black people is why they are allowed to attend, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We go to these institutions but what is the institution telling us to do? Who is the institution training us to become? Are we going to get a degree and work at Goldman Sachs or are we going to get a degree and help our people?” Simons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a recurring theme throughout the live show; Simons and Parham said that as educated, radical organizers, they believe in the importance of Black students putting into practice the knowledge they gain in higher education in order to benefit their communities.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons brought up his time as a BSU organizer at UC Berkeley, and Parham discussed his reporting of the BSU’s fight for institutional change at the university to benefit Black students. These actions led to the creation of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham encouraged students to remain resolute and aware of the importance of their activism and its precedent in the Black struggle, claiming “don’t let these crackers sway you, period, point blank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In thinking about Black students and [their] activism, we really have to demand and always keep carrying that torch forward because when we stop carrying that torch, Black students are going to drop off,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair commented on the developing situation and statement from the UCSB’s BSU Demands Team, who have been fighting for a black resource and development center over the past 50 years. UCSB recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and agreed to meet several of the BSU’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons advised Black students to fight for their people on and off-campus as well, thinking about those who cannot afford to attend college.

It is to admire the heroics of some of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to save others.”</p>\n<p>Professor Butch Ware, who teaches African history and the history of Islam at UCSB, began his speech by saying that the “topic of today’s brief address is love.”</p>\n<p>“Only love is capable of conquering hate, and the reminder comes from the Quran, the book brought by the Prophet Mohammad believed by Muslims to be God’s verbatim speech,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>“What kind of sense does it make for beings made of dirt to rank one another hierarchically above other beings made of dirt?” he asked. “The Quran reminds us over and over again that we were brought out of this earth and will be put back into it … White supremacy is the greatest historical expression of Satan’s own religion.”</p>\n<p>Ware emphasized that although Islam is mocked as a religion of violence, it is, in fact, a religion of love and peace.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack… No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in the vigil, 51 attendees lined up on either side of Storke Tower, each holding a white rose. As each victim’s name was read, each rose was placed in a vase in the center, for a total of 51 white roses.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, who spoke following the victims’ names being called, noted that this May marks five years since the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, when six people were killed.</p>\n<p>“As a community that knows the profound impact of hate armed with guns, we at UCSB also know how important it is to stand with and for each other at moments when hate threatens — whether it is sexism as it was in Isla Vista in 2014 or Islamophobia as it is today, we need to speak up and speak out against intolerance,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack,” she added. “No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy and we are seeing the danger in allowing even its smallest manifestations to pass.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn also referenced a call for gun control, which drew applause from the crowd. She said she hopes the United States follows the steps that New Zealand is taking “so that it will not be so easy for those who want to commit terrorism in the name of hate to get weapons.”</p>\n<p>“This hurts,” Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said. “I’m grieving … as a mom to 23,000 students, as a colleague, as someone who has Muslim friends. I’m looking for hope. I see that in all of you.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang spoke of denouncing “this vicious attack” and standing in solidarity with the Muslim community.</p>\n<p>“The impact of this horrible attack halfway around the globe reverberates on our campus.”</p>\n<p>The vigil ended with a Janazah prayer and a silent march to the MultiCultural Center.</p>\n<p>For MSA President Huda Faiz, infusing the vigil with Islamic traditions was important.</p>\n<p>“Typically in Islam we don’t use, like, candles … that’s more of a Christian thing,” she said. “It’s fine if we use candles, but it’s just that we wanted to do something that was authentic to our faith. Not a lot of people know, ‘How do Muslims grieve when a person passes away?’ ”</p>\n<p>She and the other organizers made it a point to incorporate aspects of Islamic funeral rituals, both with a Janazah prayer and by having an active member of the MSA’s mosque read Qur’an verses and perform a du’a.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86962\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86962\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86962\" data-attachment-id=\"86962\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86962\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The vigil ended with a Janazah prayer and a silent march to the MultiCultural Center. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The vigil itself came together in a mere 72 hours.</p>\n<p>When the MSA first learned about the attack, members were outraged, Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We had to really calm everyone down and be like, ‘Hey, guys, I know that all of your anger is justified, but being angry isn’t gonna solve anything. We need to do something that honors the victims, not focus on the shooter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>Rabie was the one who first introduced the idea of the vigil, although Faiz was worried that the turnout would be low, given it was finals week.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, the students met up to sketch out the agenda for the vigil and write their speeches.</p>\n<p>Faiz said she initially didn’t realize how much she was grieving: “The weird thing about grieving is that you don’t realize you’re a little off until after you get better, ‘cause that’s when you realize, ‘Oh, this is how better feels.’ ”</p>\n<p>“[On Thursday], it was kind of like feeling numb, like the grief hasn’t completely hit yet,” she said.</p>\n<p>Later that night, as the stories began pouring out about the lives of the victims, and as she read up on them, “that’s what really brought out the grief.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing how each person kind of has an emotional aspect or a loved one or a story, that’s what you start to relate with. That’s what really starts making you cry.”</p>\n<p>The vigil today operated as sort of the “last part of our healing,” Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We were able to feel good and see all that positivity. That kind of washes away all the fear and sadness.”</p>\n<p>As she put together the list of people who died in Christchurch, Faiz said it was then she realized just how many lives were lost.</p>\n<p>“If we just said ‘51 people passed away,’ you don’t really understand the magnitude of it.
