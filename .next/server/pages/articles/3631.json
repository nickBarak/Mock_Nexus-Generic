As crowds grew to 25,000 in 1991 and then made a massive leap to 40,000 attendees in 1992, according to the Office of Student Life, the number of accidents, crimes, violations and arrests increased as well. After this drastic surge in attendance, local law enforcement drafted a “Five Year Plan” to help limit the number of party-goers who would flood I.V. the following year in 1993. Similar to the restrictions we see today, the plan came equipped with noise ordinances, confiscation of possibly dangerous props or costumes, barricades and restricted parking, with aims to improve the safety of the community and keep things under control.</p>\n<p>According to Geoff Green, a UCSB alumnus who served as Associated Students president during the 1993-94 academic year, his year in office marked a huge transition towards a significant increase in police and authoritative presence during Halloween. Green said that although the plan has good intentions and the safety measures were needed, students seemed unsure on how Halloween would play out.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, people were onboard with the principle, but concerned with implementation,” Green said, “especially since this was only a couple years after Rodney King and the L.A. Riots — people were suspicious of law enforcement and authority.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, following the increase of police in I.V. caused an increase in the level of resident complaints against police.</p>\n<p>“1993 marked a significant jump in the level of police enforcement in I.V. during Halloween, taking authoritative levels to an all-time high,” Green said. “With this massive influx of authoritative enforcement, Isla Vista felt like a police-occupied state for many I.V. residents and afterwards, there were dozens of complaints of poor treatment by authority and many cases of civil rights abuses by authority.”</p>\n<p>Green said students organized to counter the increased presence of law enforcement with an overwhelming amount of monitoring done by citizens. Green put cameras into the hands of student volunteers to monitor Halloween in general, but also to monitor the police force. This civilian tactic worked to balance the huge numbers of law enforcement officials and keep them on their best behavior, Green said.</p>\n<p>“Recording kept law enforcement on its best behavior and it went very well, it was very peaceful and it greatly reduced the number of complaints against police behavior and unjust arrests,” Green said. “It worked as a friendly reminder to authority that we’re watching out for our community — it wasn’t an anti-cop thing, it was a way to respond to the overwhelming authority presence through being our own watching presence in the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Deputy Mark Ward, who has worked as an I.V. Foot Patrol officer for the past 15 years, the increasing numbers of enforcement officials is necessary to protect I.V. during Halloween each year.</p>\n<p>“Halloween seems to get bigger and bigger every year,” Ward said. “Consequently, with increasing numbers of visitors, the law enforcement presence also has to increase. There has to be more law enforcement available to protect the growing number of people.”</p>\n<p>Ward said he noticed that in the last few years there has been a change in attitude towards law enforcement officers, and it has been “generally more assaultive.”</p>\n<p>“Years ago, back when I started as an officer, if you saw a law enforcement officer fighting somebody you would stop what you’re doing and help the officer,” Ward said. “On the other hand, nowadays, in that same situation, everyone or witness now take out their devices to video what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>However, Green said that video recording is a part of officer-to-citizen accountability.</p>\n<p>“The advantage generally goes to law enforcement when there are stationary cameras set up and police are largely given the benefit of the doubt in cases,” Green said.</p>\n<p>According to Ward, there has been a “fundamental change” in behavioral issues in I.V. — particularly in how college-age students react to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When I started as an officer in I.V. you could walk up to a person or group and ask ‘What’s going on?’ and they would answer and be respectful,” Ward said. “Now with a simple ‘How are you doing?’ instead of receiving an answer, the group or person in question starts videotaping and chooses to escalate the encounter into a fight and it’s a waste of time, it’s dangerous and it puts everyone at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, the level of police presence in Isla Vista will “probably continue” as the norm until I.V. has more say in its own governance.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Eliason also said the woman was struck and killed at the scene and that a male member of the group suffered severe injuries to the head and chest and was airlifted to the trauma center at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. A second female also suffered moderate injuries to the head and chest and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital by ambulance.</p>\n<p>Eliason said that people who approach train tracks should use caution and minimize their time on the tracks because modern trains make less noise.</p>\n<p>“Trains these days are a lot more efficient and a lot quieter than they used to be,” Eliason said. “They can come up on you quickly and you might not realize it until its too late.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason the train was traveling at track speed, between 50 and 60mph, when it approached the group and that the engineer sounded the horn upon seeing the group but was unable to stop the train in time.</p>\n<p>Due to privacy laws, the names of the three victims and the fourth group member who was a witness have not yet been released. According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the Sheriff’s Office is working with the Chinese consulate and UCSB to notify the next of kin of the deceased.</p>\n<p>Vista Point is a popular turn out for California tourists along Highway 101 and is located approximately 20 miles northwest of campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/train-collision-kills-one-injures-two/","id":3628,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3627,3626,3625],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Judicial Council Rules In Favor of I.V.

On Wednesday, the UMC’s Judicial Council — the church’s highest court — held a hearing in Memphis, Tennessee, to determine whether or not a lower appeals court acted properly in restoring Schaefer his reverendship status in June of this year. The prosecuting clergy member in Schaefer’s case, the Rev. Christopher Fisher of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, brought an appeal to the Council in July, stating, among other reasons, that the lower appeals court “wrongly crafted” its own penalty rather than “remanding” it back to the trial court to determine the penalty.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council’s final decision was announced on its website yesterday morning and states that the church’s Jurisdictional Committee on Appeals operated accordingly in its decision to reverse the lower court’s penalty on Schaefer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Judicial Council … finds there are no errors in the application of the church law and judicial decisions,” the UMC press release stated. “The penalty as modified by the Committee on Appeals stands.”</p>\n<p>Schaefer said he is grateful to keep his status as a reverend.</p>\n<p>“I feel relieved.

Illegal plants were found in 18 different locations, primarily in national parks such as the Los Padres National Forest. Sheriffs</p>\n<p>also located campsites nearby the grow sites, however, no arrests were made during the eradication.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s spokesperson Kelly Hoover, this year’s raids yielded slightly less plants than last year but was “still a success.”</p>\n<p>“We had great collaboration with aviation, narcotic detectives and our partnering programs,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said the Sherriff’s Office attributes reduction in eradication yield from California’s continuing water shortage.</p>\n<p>“The amount we eradicated this year was lower than previous seasons and probably due to the effects of the drought,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics major Crystal Luo said the results are notable, but said she believes the numbers were not representative of all illegal marijuana sales.</p>\n<p>“[The results] are still miniscule in comparison to the underground marijuana industry as a whole. 47,000 plants is nothing when there are millions more and when each plant can even be harvested more than once,” Luo said. “I was not even aware that this eradication happened which shows how insignificant it was to me.”</p>\n<p>Luo said she does not believe the eradication’s results are worth the consequent campaign expenses.</p>\n<p>“The marijuana industry is too big to be affected by these small time eradications,” Luo said. “[You] might as well make marijuana legal to tax it and make billions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history and statistics major Steven Tragarz said he does not see a lasting impression from this eradication process.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe the costs that went into the bust was worth it; they poured millions of dollars into a short-term, stop gap solution, which effects will soon be reversed,” Tragarz said. “In short, the cops may have won the battle, but they are still losing the war.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_57527\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"621833262\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57522\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57527\" data-attachment-id=\"57527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/sheriffs-department-destroys-marijuana-plants/unnamed1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=1001%2C751&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1001,751\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57527\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=650%2C488\" alt=\"unnamed1\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/unnamed11.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illegal growers may camp in National Forest land for extended periods of time, leading to large piles of garbage, human waste and the dumping of unregulated pesticides.<em> Photo courtesy of Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
