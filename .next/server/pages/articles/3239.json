A 16-9 record, 232 strikeouts in 236 innings, a 1.83 ERA, a 0.92 WHIP and a trip to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) should be more than enough good work to walk away with the NL Cy Young Award. The Phillies’ Cliff Lee and the Marlins’ Jose Fernandez had excellent seasons as well, but Kershaw is far and away the best pitcher in baseball, and looks to continue his reign for the next decade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Relief Pitcher: Craig Kimbrel, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>Kimbrel was unhittable as the closer for the Braves this year, posting a 3.3 Wins Above Replacement mark and a 1.21 ERA while registering 50 saves. In an age where Mariano Rivera is retired and elite relievers are considered a rare luxury, Kimbrel’s 101 mph fastball earns him the title of Franchise Closer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Baseman: Chris Davis, Baltimore Orioles</p>\n<p>Baltimore faded down the stretch, but there was a time when it looked like the O’s were going to come away with the AL East crown. Davis’ historic home run streak was the heart and soul of Baltimore’s offense through the All-Star break, at which point he had 37 home runs. Davis finished the year with a .286/53/138/.370 line, enough for MVP consideration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second Baseman: Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox</p>\n<p>Dusty might not have the power numbers of rival second baseman Robinson Cano from the Yankees, but the leadership, clutch hitting, defense and intangibles that Pedroia brings to the Red Sox vault him into this spot. He is the most valuable player on the World Series Champions and would have won the award by default if not for David Ortiz having the greatest offensive series of all time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shortstop: Andrelton Simmons, Atlanta Braves</p>\n<p>You might be surprised to see a player with a .248 batting average make this list. But even if Troy Tulowitzki and Hanley Ramirez had been healthy all season, I think the 24-year old rookie phenom still would have won this award. Simmons came up with some big hits this season and provides a little pop to the Braves offense, but his true value is as the best defensive player in baseball playing the most important defensive position. To put it in numbers, Simmons won 5.4 extra games for his team compared to the average player, just as a result of his defense. The next closest shortstop put up a 2.2 DWAR. To put it rhetorically, Simmons is the next Ozzie Smith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third Baseman: Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers</p>\n<p>Stat nuts and Bay-Area folk might be disappointed to find Miggy here over A’s third baseman Josh Donaldson, who was fourth in baseball with an 8.0 WAR. But Cabrera’s deficiencies on defense are overshadowed by his impact on offense as the most dominant hitter of our generation. A .348/44/137/.442 line speaks for itself when this MVP caliber season is merely average considering the player’s recent history.</p>\n<p>Outfield: Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels</p>\n<p>Trout got off to a slow start, but quietly bounced back to be the best player in baseball yet again (9.2 WAR). If not for the Josh Hamilton/Albert Pujols disaster, the Angels would have been in contention and trout would have taken home the MVP hardware he should have won last year. Instead, he will get snubbed for the second year in a row. Good thing the kid is only 22 years old and has another 15 years to dominate baseball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Andrew McCutchen, Pittsburg Pirates</p>\n<p>The Pirates never would have ended their playoff drought without the incredible performance of their superstar centerfielder. McCutchen is the epitome of a five tool player, the NL’s equivalent to Trout. As long as he’s in town, the Pirates should be able to show that they were no fluke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Outfield: Carlos Gomez, Milwaukee Brewers</p>\n<p>Gomez enjoyed a renaissance 2013 season, which established him as the star many thought he would be years ago. Maybe it’s the water, maybe it’s the local beer, but whatever it is, Gomez needs to keep drinking it. A career sub-.250 hitter, the 27 year-old broke out not only in average (.284), but in power (24 homeruns) and defense (career high 4.6 DWAR). The 8.4 WAR he brought his team are as many as every previous season combined. The career journeyman should have a home in Miller Park for many years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily

unveiled at the Isla Vista Community Center at 2 p.m., where artists and other attendees gathered to celebrate the pieces and their contribution to the visibility of undocumented students who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>The two murals were designed by UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success (I.D.E.A.S.) member, Apolinar De Jesus, and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) Digital Production Coordinator, Dei Garcia.</p>\n<p>De Jesus, a second-year art major, said one of the pieces was primarily inspired by transgender activist and former UCSB student Zoraida Reyes.

But can they do it again? If they could, they would cement themselves as one of the dynasties in NBA history, as only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls have ever won three straight titles.</p>\n<p>However, before Miami can think about the legacy they could create, they have to endure 82 games and get to the NBA finals for the fourth straight year, which will be tougher than ever with an incredibly competitive Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Heat, they happen to have the two-time reigning MVP in LeBron James, who has gotten better every year. The key for Miami this year will be staying healthy. Its players have logged a lot of minutes in the last three years with three finals trips. If they lose key pieces to injury, the three-peat will be a no-go. But with last year’s roster basically intact, if they can stay healthy, you never know. We may be watching history in the making.</p>\n<p>The Hype in Brooklyn</p>\n<p>On paper, Brooklyn has to have one of the best teams in the league, and possibly the best team in the Nets’ history.</p>\n<p>That roster begins with point guard Deron Williams, one of the best in the league. He’ll have a stacked roster to work with options such as Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Brook Lopez. They also brought in defensive stopper Andrei Kirilenko and shooter Jason Terry. Basically, Brooklyn looks set in every position, but what’s unknown is whether they can come together as a team.</p>\n<p>Several of these players are reaching the end of their careers, so the challenge for freshly retired and new Head Coach Jason Kidd will not only be to make this team mesh, but to find chemistry in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Lakers’ Injury Status</p>\n<p>Despite the star power in L.A. last season, the Lakers never came together, particularly because of injuries. This season, there is one injury in particular that will matter most: Kobe Bryant’s.</p>\n<p>This team lives and dies right now on the play of Bryant. Nevertheless, this hard-working, determined superstar needs to be careful not to come back too soon. He’s no longer 25 and is showing signs of slowing down. As badly as he wants to be on the court, he needs to stay healthy if the Lakers want a shot at making the playoffs, because without him, they won’t.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with Bryant, the Lakers will always be dangerous. His scoring ability can bring in a win any night of the week.</p>\n<p>A New Era in Sacramento</p>\n<p>The Sacramento Kings have finally finalized where they’ll be playing for a long time: Sacramento. Now that they can actually focus on basketball, it’ll be about rebuilding in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings just announced the contract extension of DeMarcus Cousins and have decent depth at the point guard spot between Isaiah Thomas and Greivis Vasquez.</p>\n<p>With new ownership working on a new arena and increasing ticket sales and sponsorship, Sacramento is moving in the right direction. They’re certainly not championship material yet, and may not even be playoff contenders, but the improvement by the Kings should be tangible.</p>\n<p>Howard in Houston</p>\n<p>The question right now with Dwight Howard is whether he can find a team he can be happy with. With Orlando, he wasn’t winning, but he was the star. With L.A., he wasn’t the focus and that was a problem. Nothing’s been right so far. So, Howard is once again starting over, this time in Houston.</p>\n<p>Howard brings a much-needed inside presence, as well as a defensive edge, to a Rockets team that has one great scorer in James Harden and a great distributor in Jeremy Lin.</p>\n<p>With his height, wingspan and athletic ability, Howard should be a premier center this year and should turn the Rockets into a playoff contender. But with Howard’s track record, that is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-22/the-top-five-stories-at-the-beginning-of-the-nba-season/","id":3237,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3236,3235,3234],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Marcus Mariota Goes First to the Jaguars","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville is perhaps the worst team in the NFL since the 2008 Lions finished the season 0-16. The Jaguars are finishing this season with two wins at most and should secure the first pick. While Jadeveon Clowney is the highest-rated player on most experts’ draft boards, the Jaguars need a franchise quarterback and cannot afford to pass up the opportunity. Blaine Gabbert simply isn’t getting the job done. Mariota is an interesting dual-threat quarterback with unlimited potential, as he is only a redshirt sophomore at Oregon. If he keeps improving as a passer this year and helps the Ducks to a BCS title, he could very well be the first pick.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay hasn’t been much better than Jacksonville this year and has yet to win a game. A new quarterback doesn’t seem to be an option here as the Buccaneers have faith in rookie Mike Glennon to develop into a formidable option. That’s when the Buccaneers go for the highest-rated player rather than the area of most need. Clowney is a once-in-a-decade-type athlete with the size and power of a defensive end and the speed of a safety. Tampa Bay would be foolish to pass up on Clowney and could pair him up on the defensive line with Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. That would certainly improve the Buccaneers’ defense and give them a multitude of weapons similar to their glory days in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Last season, Minnesota rode Adrian Peterson’s record season to the playoffs, but with A.P. slowed down this year, the Vikings are once again floundering The Vikings trio of quarterbacks in Christian Ponder, Josh Freeman and Matt Cassel don’t seem like likely long-term options in Minnesota, although Freeman certainly has an opportunity to change the front office’s mind once he returns from injury. Bridgewater entered this season as the top-rated quarterback, but Mariota simply has more upside and has performed better to date. The Louisville signal caller has the poise in the pocket to balance a Minnesota attack so heavily reliant on the run.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Louis Rams — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Just when the Rams look like they’ve turned a corner, starting quarterback Sam Bradford tears his ACL in a season-ending injury. With Kellen Clemens as the current starter for St. Louis, there does not appear to be much hope in the Gateway City this season. Bradford will be back and fully healthy next season with a young array of offensive weapons. Defensively, St. Louis is set at the most important positions, so the Rams will look to upgrade their offensive line with Matthews replacing the oft-injured Rodger Saffold at right tackle. Matthews has done a superb job of protecting Johnny Football’s blind side the last two seasons at A&amp;M and should have no trouble sliding over to the right side of the line and protecting Bradford this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Steelers — Anthony Barr, OLB, UCLA</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh has been the biggest disappointment in the NFL this season. Defense has always been the key to success for the Steelers, and adding an elite pass rusher who can wreak havoc in Pittsburgh’s 3-4 system looks to be the smartest move. Add Barr to a core of linebackers including LaMarr Woodley, Jarvis Jones and Lawrence Timmons and Pittsburgh might feature the best and most athletic group of linebackers in the game. Barr has been a defensive revelation for UCLA after switching over from playing fullback during his first two seasons. He has the size and speed to slide over to defensive end if need be and does a solid job not only rushing the quarterback, but also roaming the field, racking up tackles and even dropping back into coverage. This guy is a freak of an athlete and the best defensive prospect other than Clowney.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/","id":3238,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3237,3236,3235],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
