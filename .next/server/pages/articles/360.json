The 49ers cemented their current third-place position in the conference at 9-11 overall, 3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was a rough game for us. Quite frankly we just didn’t come ready to play,” senior guard Michael Bryson said. “It’s kind of frustrating. I don’t know how many times we have to take a loss for us to respond.”</p>\n<p>In recent outings, UCSB has been at its worst late in the second half, especially in last Saturday’s 61-52 loss to UC Irvine when the it went scoreless for the final 10:50 at home. Last night’s game told a different story, as the 49ers got off to a quick 10-2 start out of the gate, including seven points from freshman forward Mason Riggins.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer from senior guard Michael Bryson with 10:07 left cut the lead to 12-9, but Long Beach responded with a 19-7 run and never looked back. The 49er lead was 36-23 the halftime break and never reached higher than 15 for the game, but every time momentum looked to be swinging toward UCSB, the Beach had an answer.</p>\n<p>“In the first half we came out a little slow, sluggish, lethargic, just not really energized and ready to play,” senior forward John Green said. “In the second half we were starting to click a little bit but it’s tough to get out of a hole when a team is making shots.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach guard Justin Bibbins was there to kill the Gauchos’ runs all night, going 5-5 on three-pointers for a game-high 25 points.</p>\n<p>“They hit open threes that we were giving them, they were attacking, really going at us, putting their shoulder down,” Bryson said. “They were the aggressor tonight and it shows. Once they took the lead they never gave it back.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson looked calm and collected on offense all night, scoring a UCSB-high 23 points. The conference’s leading scorer finished with an efficient 10-16 shooting night, including 3-6 on threes, before fouling out late in the game.</p>\n<p>After trailing for nearly the entire game, a late comeback gave the Gauchos hope that they could salvage a win despite a lethargic first half performance. Five straight points from senior forward John Green cut the lead to 69-61 with 4:55 remaining. Just 92 seconds later, a left-handed lay-in by Bryson cut it to 71-65, bringing UCSB the closest it had been since the 8:12 mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>From there, it was the 5’8” Bibbins who finished off Santa Barbara once and for all, scooping in a dagger layup with 2:11 remaining to give the 49ers a 10-point lead on their way to the 77-67 win.</p>\n<p>“The second half I recognized that group, but you can’t play 20 or 30 minutes, you’ve got to play 40 minutes,” Williams said. “Long Beach played well offensively and Bibbins was sensational, but when you can’t get stops, it’s really difficult to crawl back in a game.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach shot 50 percent for the night, taking advantage of poor UCSB defense by scoring relatively easy open shots off down screens and dribble penetration. The Gauchos shot 42.1 percent as a team for the game, but were a much different team in the second half, scoring 44 points compared to just 23 in the first.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to take some positives away from the loss. Its 17 free throw attempts were the most it has had in its last seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I did like how we competed the second half of the game,” Williams said. “We kept the pedal on, we kept attacking, we didn’t get our heads down, we kept aggressive the second half of the game.”</p>\n<p>The night also saw the return of Green, who missed the Gauchos’ last six games with a knee injury. Clearly not at 100 percent as he played with a brace, Green provided the Gauchos some much needed energy and offensive punch, recording 12 points and seven rebounds off the bench.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ improved second-half energy also saw them finish with a 38-28 rebounding advantage. Freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak led all players with eight boards.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, UCSB will play the last of its current three-game homestand against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/sluggish-first-half-drowns-gauchos-at-home/","id":360,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[359,358,357],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Pick up First Road Win of Season, 3-1 in BW with Wins over CSUN & CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-13-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-13-of-13-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is no longer winless on the road this season after wins at Cal State Northridge and Cal State Fullerton over the weekend.

Fullerton also sits at 2-15, 0-3 in the Big West after losses to UCSB and Cal Poly, extending its losing streak to 15 games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos’ ballhandling over the two games was most valuable as they finished with a season-low 10 against Fullerton to end their six-game streak of 20-plus turnovers. They followed this performance with a second-best total of 12 at CSUN.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 three-point percentage against the Matadors marked the third time over its six-game span in which it shot over 40 percent from beyond the arc. It was a shooting clinic for the Gauchos in the first quarter of Saturday’s game as they went 5-6 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>After an early 6-2 lead to open the quarter and an eventual 9-9 tie, the Matadors would go on to trail for the remainder of the game. The abundance of perimeter shots helped UCSB put together a 22-4 scoring run to close out the quarter with a 31-13 lead.</p>\n<p>A total of four different Gauchos drained at least one three-point attempt during the run with freshman guard Coco Miller, going 2-2 from long range for her only three-point field goals of the game to finish with 12 points and tied her career-high in steals with a game-high five.</p>\n<p>Another one of those Gauchos was senior guard Jasmine Ware. In just 23 minutes of play, Ware scored a game-high 17 points off the bench on an 8-11 shooting effort to go along with three assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its run in the second quarter with a 7-2 scoring stretch to begin the quarter, forcing a Northridge timeout. CSUN’s 12-4 run led to it trailing 27-45 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite being down for the entirety of the game, CSUN’s advantage on the boards helped it to remain in the game. It outrebounded UCSB 40-31 as freshman center Channon Fluker recorded a game-high 15 rebounds and guard Cheyenne Allen finished with 11.</p>\n<p>The closest Northridge came within UCSB’s lead was a 12-point deficit of 42-54. Helping CSUN in its comeback attempt was junior guard Emily Cole. Responsible for two of the Matadors’ total of three perimeter shots in the game, Cole led the Matadors in scoring with 14 points.</p>\n<p>Still, CSUN’s edge on the glass would not be enough as UCSB’s consistent scoring offense ended with a 45.8 field goal percentage versus CSUN’s 35.8 shooting percentage. Along with Ware and Miller, sophomore guard Makala Roper (10) and junior center Je zhe Newton (11) finished with double-figures in scoring as UCSB secured its 65-49 victory.</p>\n<p>It was a solid outing for Newton after having her best performance of the season at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday. She set a season-high in scoring with 15 points against the Titans, tallying her third-straight game with double-figures. Newton also had seven rebounds and three blocks on the night.</p>\n<p>It was a quick start to the game by Fullerton, opening with a 5-0 scoring run for the lead. At the helm of the Titans’ swift start was freshman forward Michelle Berry and freshman guard Jade Vega. In spite of her inefficient shooting (6-23), Berry earned a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds while Vega finished with 11 points.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 5-0 run of its own to tie the game up. A 22-13 lead was the Gauchos’ largest lead of the first half, but CSUF persevered with an 8-0 run as UCSB managed to maintain a 26-24 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Fullerton to a 32.7 field goal percentage on the night. Most importantly, it limited the Titans’ three-point shot as they shot 27.8 percent from long range. The Gauchos’ defense enhanced their offense as they ended the game shooting 49 percent from the field. Notably, their 58.3 field goal percentage in the second half enabled them to take a substantial lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara outscored Fullerton 39-23 in the final two quarters of the game. It was a breakout half for Ware as she scored 11 of her 13 points in the latter portion of the game on 5-8 shooting. Roper made half of the Gauchos’ three-point field goals to finish with 13 points as well.</p>\n<p>Unable to establish a perimeter presence, Fullerton’s offense was out of sync and could not prevent UCSB from scoring as the Gauchos cruised to a 65-45 win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to end UC Davis’ undefeated conference record (3-0) as it will face the Aggies on Thursday, Jan. 21 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67461\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67461\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-of-season-3-1-in-bw-with-wins-over-csun-csuf/","id":357,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[356,355,354],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Capitalize on Momentous Win, Face LBSU Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsUCI-CamerynBrock-01162016-30-web.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"In the middle of the pack in the Big West standings at fourth place, the UCSB men's basketball team has an opportunity to even out its 2-3 conference record in its matchup against Long Beach State ton...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off a big 74-61 win over Cal State Northridge on Saturday, the UCSB men’s basketball team heads on the road hoping to continue its momentum tonight against Long Beach State.

They eventually went on to snag the much-needed win, their only victory in a three-game home stand.</p>\n<p>Against Long Beach in the prior game, UCSB bounced back from a miserable 23 point first half to put up 44 in the final 20 minutes, making a run reducing a 15 point lead to just six before coming up just short. Senior guard Michael Bryson scored a team-high 23 points on 10-16 shooting in that game and currently leads the Big West with 18.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>The 49ers were led by Bibbins in that game, whose performance was called “sensational” by UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams. The 5’8” guard torched the Gauchos for 25 points on 8-12 shooting including 5-5 from three-point range, putting in a dagger layup with 2:11 to go that ended all hopes of a UCSB comeback. He leads his team with 5.3 assists per game and averages 11.4 ppg for the year.</p>\n<p>More offensive balance would be huge for a Gaucho team that has struggled to score, averaging a second-worst mark of 65.2 ppg as a team since the beginning of conference play.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, they have made a second-best 38.2 percent from three during that same stretch, suggesting they may need to rely more on their outside shooting.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Gabe Vincent has been UCSB’s top threat from deep since finding his shot in recent weeks. He ranks second in three-pointers made since the beginning of conference, making 18-42 for a 42.9 percent mark.</p>\n<p>Getting center Sam Beeler more involved deep in the paint could also prove beneficial for the Gauchos, as the 6’10” senior leads the conference by a mile with a 74.4 shooting percentage. He is coming off a perfect 12-point, 6-6 shooting night against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Other than Bibbins, the 49ers only other double-digit scorer is Nick Faust, who puts up 15.5 points and 5.5 rebounds a night. The senior guard played three seasons at Maryland, where he was one of the Terrapins’ key contributors and was named to the All-ACC Freshman team. He transferred to Long Beach in 2014 before sitting out an NCAA-mandated redshirt season last year.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will tipoff at 7:30 p.m. at Walter Pyramid in Long Beach and will be shown on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/mens-basketball-7/","id":358,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[357,356,355],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vincent’s Game-Winner Salvages Road Win at Cal Poly, but Gauchos Falter in Consecutive Second Halves","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team picked up its first conference win on the road against Cal Poly, but sputtered down the stretch in a home game against UC Irvine on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67425\" style=\"width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67425\" data-attachment-id=\"67425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/looking-at-a-teammate-john-green-passes-the-ball-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Looking at a teammate, John Green passes the ball.

The Gauchos came through on the road against Cal Poly last Thursday, winning 76-73 thanks to a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Gabe Vincent with 11 seconds left after losing a 15 point lead.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara fell apart in the second half for the second straight game, being held scoreless through the final 10:50 on the way to a 61-52 loss in its home conference opener.</p>\n<p>“We just wore out. We just got tired and it’s become apparent to me that it’s a problem,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got leads or we’re right there in the last three or four minutes of games and we’ve got no pop. We look fatigued and the type of mistakes we were making were fatigue mistakes.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Out of the nine teams in the Big West, UCSB is one of six that currently has a record of 1-2 or worse in the conference. The Gauchos stand at 7-9 overall and 1-2 in conference play. The Mustangs share an identical record, putting both teams tied for the fifth best mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters, who were predicted to finish first in the Big West this season, sit atop the standings alongside Hawai’i at 15-5 overall, 4-0 conference. They are one of two teams in the Big West that is still undefeated through the opening two weeks of conference.</p>\n<p>Facing UC Irvine and college basketball’s most imposing inside force in sophomore center Mamadou Ndiaye on Saturday, the Gauchos knew they would need to be able to score from outside the paint in order to win. From very early on, they showed not only the willingness to take shots from deep, but the ability to make them.</p>\n<p>After falling behind 8-0 through less than three minutes of play, all points being scored by Irvine’s senior forward Mike Best, UCSB answered back with 15 consecutive points, hitting 5-7 three-pointers during the run to take a 15-8 lead by the 11:55 mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>That tactic didn’t change much before the first half buzzer, as the Gauchos, led by junior point guard Eric Childress, finished the first stanza knocking down 8-17 from deep, while shooting just 3-13 from inside the arc. Childress finished the half with 12 points on 4-4 shooting, all threes, to give UCSB a 30-28 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>The second half told a much different story as the Gauchos went away from the three-ball and were unable to match the Anteaters’ energy down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“We knew coming in we were going to have to make shots to beat this team because they’re so big inside the paint,” Childress said. “We knew we had to rely on the three, but at the end we should’ve got into the paint a little bit more so it hurt us towards the end.”</p>\n<p>A pair of highlight dunks from senior guard Michael Bryson helped keep momentum on the UCSB side as his side early in the second half. First, Childress found Bryson cutting down the baseline for a spectacular, left-handed slam that the Anteater defense could do nothing but watch, putting the Gauchos up 38-32 with 17:21 to go.</p>\n<p>Bryson followed that up just three minutes later, taking a perfect halfcourt lob from Childress over the heads of several defenders and finishing gracefully with a two-hand dunk to keep UCSB up 44-39.</p>\n<p>After Vincent hit his fourth three-pointer of the night to put his team up 52-44 with 10:50 to go, the Gaucho offense began to sputter and the Anteaters took over, taking a drastic advantage in the free-throw department.</p>\n<p>“We started not moving the ball around, settling with our looks that we were getting, not really sticking to our concepts and we just got rushed,” Bryson said. “Towards the end of the game we tightened up and didn’t do what we normally do, so we’ve got to learn from it and get ready for [this] week.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Luke Nelson’s three-pointer out of a timeout with 3:51 left put the Anteaters up 54-52, giving them their first lead since the 15:37 mark in the first half. Nelson came back down the court less than a minute later to knock down a second consecutive jumper, and the Gauchos fell apart as they proceeded to turn the ball over on three of their next four possessions. Irvine ended the game on a 17-0 run, holding UCSB to 0-11 from the field, 0-4 from the foul line, and five turnovers over the final 10:50 seconds.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would have shot more [three-pointers] to be honest with you. If you can’t beat Mamadou at the rim, you’ve got to knock down some mid-range shots, no doubt, but you’ve also got to make some threes,” Williams said. “We didn’t shoot as many in the second half, and I think we would’ve been better off taking eight more threes in the second half than the bad shots we took.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot just 3-9 from three in the second half, making just 9-27 shots overall. They finished the game with just one made free throw on five attempts, compared to 14-22 from the line for Irvine in the second half alone. The Anteaters were 19-32 on free throws for the game.</p>\n<p>“The big disappointment is a lot of our fouls were shooting fouls, especially in the second half,” Williams said. “On the defensive side I think we did a good job on [Ndiaye]. We said we’d rather have him shoot free throws than get a dunk. The difference in the game was Mike Best.”</p>\n<p>For Irvine, Best’s hot start saw him end with a game-high 20 points on 8-13 shooting. Ndiaye was held to just 1-3 from the field and had just one block, but still managed to get to hurt UCSB, making 9-16 from the foul line to finish with 11 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, Vincent, Bryson and Childress were a combined 10-20 from three-point range, putting up marks of 14, 13 and 12 points, respectively, but simply didn’t have enough gas in the tank down the stretch to pull off a second consecutive win.</p>\n<p>“I think we need to want it more. It was coming easy to us the first half,” Bryson said. “When shots weren’t falling in the second half, we got lazy and weren’t doing the little things we needed to do to get a win. I don’t think we wanted it enough tonight.”</p>\n<p>Against Cal Poly two nights prior, the Gauchos had one of their better shooting first halves of the season, going 17-34 from the field to take a 43-38 lead into halftime on the road. Vincent was on fire in the first half, hitting five straight three-pointers as he headed into the break with a game-high 17 points on 6-10 shooting.</p>\n<p>UCSB held onto the lead for most of the second half, as a pair of free throws by Vincent made it 68-53 with 7:41 to go. However, the recent trend of the Gauchos falling apart late in games showed its head once again, as the Mustangs went on a furious rally. Senior forward Joel Awich’s three-pointer with 1:29 remaining put Cal Poly up 73-72, giving the Mustangs’ their first lead since the eight minute mark of the first half.</p>\n<p>With less than 20 seconds to go, Bryson drove through the middle before finding Vincent cutting down the left side, and Vincent finished with a strong layup while being fouled to put UCSB back up 74-73. A missed free throw gave Cal Poly a chance to win it at the other end, but senior guard David Nwaba missed the potential game-winning layup with seconds left.</p>\n<p>After a pair of made free throws by Childress, Cal Poly’s Ridge Shipley missed a three-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Gauchos a 76-73 victory and their first conference win of the season.</p>\n<p>Vincent finished as the hero with career-highs in points (27) and three-pointers made (7-11), while forward Sam Beeler came up big with 17 points and 12 rebounds on an efficient 8-9 shooting night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be back in action tomorrow as they face Long Beach State in the second of a three-game homestand. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/vincents-game-winner-salvages-road-win-at-cal-poly-but-gauchos-falter-in-consecutive-second-halves/","id":359,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[358,357,356],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
