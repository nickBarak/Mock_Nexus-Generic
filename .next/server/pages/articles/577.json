Another large crowd is expected to rock the Dome Thursday night as UCSB hosts rival Long Beach State at 8 p.m. in an ESPN televised game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest with a 9-5 overall record and 0-1 mark in the Big West, falling in the Blue-Green Rivalry against Cal Poly in front of a season-high 5,982 fans on Saturday to open conference play. This time around, the Gauchos hope to reward a large crowd with a victory over another rival school.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t play with an edge against Cal Poly. If we play with an edge we’re a really good team so that’s our message of the week,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It should be a good energy again. Hopefully we can get a crowd out here again and have everybody we had at the last game come back, and hopefully we can play with that edge that we’re known for.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Big Al paced UCSB with 33 points and 15 rebounds in Saturday’s loss to Cal Poly, but sloppy defense and the inability to hit the outside shot negated Big Al’s outstanding performance. The big man is certainly motivated not to let the Gauchos lose a second straight game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s definitely important for me; I haven’t beat them yet so it’d be good to get that first win over Long Beach,” Big Al said. “It’s always been a big rivalry: they’ve always been known to play us really tough and us to play them really tough in return. It should be a lot of exciting play on Thursday.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach enters the contest with a 5-11 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference play. The 49ers began Big West play with a narrow loss to UC Irvine on Thursday before handily beating UC Davis on Saturday. Despite sporting a losing record, Long Beach has faced a number of good teams this season, possessing the second strongest non-conference schedule in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great game. Long Beach is a good team. They’ve played a lot of good teams this year,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “Their record doesn’t show how good they are but we know what we need to do coming into this game and we’re going to make sure we come out of this game with a 1-1 record.”</p>\n<p>Bryson will face a tough test defensively as he will match up against junior guard Tyler Lamb, a transfer from UCLA in his first year with Long Beach, who has averaged over 18 points per game in his six games of play since becoming eligible in late December.</p>\n<p>Other Long Beach players to watch will be junior guard Michael Caffey and senior forward Dan Jennings. Caffey is sixth in the conference averaging 16 points per game, while Jennings is fourth in rebounds with 7.5 boards per game. UCSB junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and Big Al will each face tough assignments against Caffey and Jennings.</p>\n<p>“I think [Harmon is] ready to play against Caffey. I think Caffey is a very good player, he does an excellent job,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They also have Jennings who is a great center and Tyler Lamb is one of the best wings in the league. We think Long Beach is one of the top teams in league.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to rebound from Saturday’s loss they will need Bryson along with sophomore forward Taran Brown and senior guard Kyle Boswell to hit outside shots. UCSB shot 2-17 in the loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We put it behind us. We’re a team that we know we can shoot,” Bryson said. “We know that if we get inside to Al and he throws outside to us, he knows we’re going to knock it down for him. We just need to keep the same confidence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has not defeated the 49ers since the 2011 Big West Tournament Championship Game, which sent the Gauchos to the NCAA Tournament. Fans can be sure the Gauchos will bring their A-game on Thursday in hopes of playing in front of another large crowd and a television audience.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s vital [when fans show up], especially for a lot of guys, it just gives something to play for and a lot more energy in the crowd so that we don’t have to produce it ourselves,” Big Al said. “We’re going to come out and play with our own intensity and our own energy, but it always helps to have the crowd’s energy and support behind you.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against rival Long Beach State is scheduled for 8 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPNU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos rallied to as close as three but could never get over the hump, often failing to hit clutch shots and opting for three-pointers instead of the steady inside presence of Williams.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a guy that they can’t handle, you keep going to him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We didn’t have the discipline tonight where we’ve had that discipline in many games. We didn’t make Cal Poly make a decision.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 2-17 from the three-point line, whereas Cal Poly finished 11-18 from behind the arc, proving to be the major difference in the game.</p>\n<p>The only story for UCSB in this game was Big Al’s 33-point, 15-rebound performance. Williams scored 22 for UCSB in the second half and was one of only two Gauchos to score in double figures, the other being junior point guard Zalmico Harmon with 10 points.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly played very well, and we didn’t respond,” Coach Williams said. “I thought Al showed up, but I don’t think anybody else showed up and responded.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs received much of their scoring from unlikely sources in this game. Junior forward Anthony Silvestri finished with a team-high 17 points, going 5-7 from behind the arc despite his season average of under four points scored per game. Another bench player in freshman guard Taylor Sutlive added 11 points on 3-4 shooting from the three. Together, the duo provided dagger after dagger towards Santa Barbara’s hopes of climbing back in the game.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t contest, we didn’t listen and we didn’t switch or pay attention to the good shooters,” Harmon said. “No offense to them, they’re a great team, but we let two guys who’d come off the bench come in and light us up off of miscommunication and not knowing personnel.”</p>\n<p>Opening conference play with a loss, especially at the hands of a rival, was a major disappointment for the Gauchos considering how well they played in the non-conference portion of the schedule.</p>\n<p>“It happens, we hate that it happens, it shouldn’t happen, but tonight it happened. It’s time for some reflection,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to look ourselves in the mirror and see what we did wrong and fix all the things that we need to fix. It’s a long season, we’ve just got to get back in practice and do better and get our focus back.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Last Saturday, the Gauchos were blown out 88-70 by the Mustangs in the first Blue-Green rivalry game of the season. Two players nearly single-handedly took down UCSB with 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer scoring a career-high 37 points and junior guard Ariana Elegado totaling 30 points.</p>\n<p>“You have to have a short term period, especially in conference because you have a game on Thursday and then a game on Saturday,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I know I was thinking about it the entire weekend, so we have to let it go. Right now, we’re focused on Long Beach. They’re just as good.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers have compiled a 9-7 overall and 1-1 conference mark thus far, defeating UC Irvine before losing to UC Davis. In both games, Long Beach came from behind in the second half.</p>\n<p>After giving up 88 points against Cal Poly, the focus this week for UCSB is 100 percent on defense.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t worked on one thing offensively this week,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Early in the year, as a head coach, I made that adjustment [to run] because we had no bigs, but now as we go into conference play and into postseason, there’s no way we’re going to win unless we play defense.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Long Beach features balanced scoring and is a team currently playing through its guards. Freshman guard Raven Benton leads the 49ers at 14.4 points per game while two-time All-Big West honorable selection member Alex Sanchez averages 11.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They have [Benton], who is pretty fast. She can knock down the jumper and get to the rim,” freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “Then they also have two other bigger guards that can play a post. We just have to play some good ‘D.’”</p>\n<p>However, the 49ers’ recipe for success this season has been on the defensive end. They lead the Big West in steals with 11.2 per game, 13.5 during conference play and rank second in blocks with 4.1 per game.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos top the Big West in turnovers, giving the ball away just 13.7 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“The things that they do that’s messed with a lot of people is that they switch defenses every trip down the floor,” Mitchell said. “So whether they’re going 2-2-1, 1-3-1, or 3-2, they’re switching it up and it’s causing people to turn the ball over. Hopefully by us playing two point guards and four guards most of the time, it will alleviate some of the turnovers.”</p>\n<p>This matchup with Long Beach should suit Santa Barbara well as UCSB also plays through its guards. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit ranks third in the league in points per game with 17.6. Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig, both of whom stepped up in San Luis Obispo, also average double-digits with 14.0 and 13.3 points per game, respectively. Mason scored a career-high 24 points Saturday and both Zornig and Mason shot 4-5 from three point range.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB is the only team in the Big West to feature three players in the top 14 in scoring.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because we don’t even talk about it. We know our roles and what we need to contribute to the game,” Mason said. “We’re seniors putting the team on our backs because we have a lot of newcomers. We know the system, so we’re getting shots we know we shoot well at and knocking them down.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 7 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/","id":575,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[574,573,572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Everyone Looks Up to These Gauchos … Literally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nexus Sports Sits Down With the Big Men of the UCSB Men’s Basketball Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I had the chance to sit with Sam Beeler, Alan Williams and Mitch Brewe yesterday at practice and got to know them a little better.

You go around and you can just hang around with basically anybody, have a good time on weekends and have a good time in class. It’s challenging enough for it to be difficult, but it’s also easygoing enough for you to have a good time and enjoy your college experience.</p>\n<p>Brewe: The people know how to have a good time but still are smart and kick ass in school. Which is crazy because it’s such a good academic university even though it’s Isla Vista and all that crazy stuff going on … ­­to still be academically focused, that’s pretty cool too. And the beach, too! It’s awesome being around the beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Has there been a funny incident or something unusual that happens to you because you’re tall?</strong></p>\n<p>Brewe: I ride my long board everywhere and this tiny Asian girl riding her long board got so indecisive when she saw me coming, she just totally bailed out and fell into the grass and I was literally like five feet away from her and not going to hit her whatsoever. She literally just tumbled into the grass with her backpack and everybody was like, “What just happened?” I think I kind of intimidated her off her skateboard a little bit.</p>\n<p>Williams: Spider webs suck when you’re big and tall. Another thing is when you walk around, everybody looks up at you and stares in awe. You just get a whole bunch of crazy looks all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: My shower at home is terrible. I bend down in it all the time and I end up just sitting in it. The most common thing is I’ll be sitting in class next to someone, and I’ve already been sitting in there prior to them coming in, so we’re just talking or whatever and class ends and I get up and they’re like, “Oh my God, like, you’re huge. I didn’t realize it when you were sitting down.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do people usually ask you about your height?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Williams: Everybody asks me, “Can I ask you a question?” It’s just like, yeah of course, I already know what you’re going to ask: “How tall am I?” So, you just tell them, “6’8”.” And they’re like, “Oh my God, that’s so tall.” They ask us how tall we are all the time. You should see Sam in airports, it’s ridiculous. Sam in an airport gathers so much attention because he’s 6’11”. He’s just huge and everybody will ask him how tall he is.</p>\n<p>Beeler: And then it’s all the jokes that you’ve heard before too. I know some people get offended by it or whatever, but for me I just try to be nice about it. I’m so used to it at this point it doesn’t even bother me. It’s just another thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about being a basketball player?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: I’d say it’s the travel for me. I’ve been so many places thanks to just playing basketball in general; just places I’d never imagined going. Sometimes it’s a bad thing that I’m in the middle of nowhere, Northern Illinois or something like that. A lot of times you get to go to a lot of places like Hawaii, Seattle, Salt Lake (City), Louisiana. It’s awesome to be able to experience that, especially with people that you actually like being around too.</p>\n<p>Brewe: This is going to be corny, but I kind of like representing the school, like being a part of something bigger, you know. Being a part of the university and being kind of a face of the university, and hopefully we can set a good example and be a good part of the legacy here. I think that’s pretty cool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Is it tough balancing being a normal college student while being a student athlete?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: There’s no “normal” being a college student when you’re an athlete because it’s just so time-consuming. But you get to do the simple stuff sometimes. It’s good when you have a couple days off and you can relax and go to the beach or relax and go hang out with your friends. But a lot of times our focus is always on getting better every day. We spend countless hours shooting in the gym or lifting and stuff like that. In everything we do, we try to incorporate how it’s going to make us a better player, and if that means we can go and hang out on the side, that’s a good thing. We put our sports and our academics first all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: That’s the thing about being a student athlete; you have to figure out the balance and time management, that’s a big thing.</p>\n<p>Williams: Mitch is like a super smart, A-plus student so he can tell you all about that.</p>\n<p>Brewe: Finding the time for homework is the hardest. You get home from practice and you just want to lie in your bed and not do a thing. I just want to sleep. But you have to get home and you have to be like, “In 10 minutes I’m going to open this damn book and I’m going to read.” Really just committing yourself is pretty tough. Like these guys said, it’s time consuming but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do you guys ever get a chance to go out on DP and do you go as a team?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: All the time, definitely. We hang out a lot, especially on the weekends when we get a couple of days off if we don’t have practice the next day we’ll go out and enjoy ourselves out there. But we always know there are consequences with doing that kind of stuff. We’re seen as, like you said, someone other than just a normal college student and whatever we do represents our team and our university in either a positive or negative way. When we’re out there, we do it in a smart way and we’re always safe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tell UCSB students why they should come out and watch you play Long Beach on Thursday.</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: It’s fun; it’s a great energy. You see a fast-paced kind of sport. We’re up and down, we’re dunking the ball and three-point shots ­­­— all that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of intensity and it’s a lot of tradition that goes into UCSB basketball. We put in a lot of hard work for this university, so it’d be great to have them come out and support us.</p>\n<p>Beeler: It’s fun for us when we get big crowds like that and hopefully it’s fun for them to come and be a big crowd. We’re super grateful for the people who do come out and it’s just awesome when they do.</p>\n<p>Williams: And it’s on TV too. Be on SportsCenter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/","id":576,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[575,574,573],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
