Lincoln would also go 2.2 innings, but not because of a short leash. The pitch count rose quickly for Lincoln as he could not find the zone. The stuff was there showing a 90 to 91 mph fastball and good movement on both his slider and changeup, but most pitches would miss low or in the dirt.</p>\n<p>Lincoln would be a part of a rough third inning that would be a huge part in deciding the game early in favor of the home team. After getting two out in the bottom of the third, Lincoln would give up a dead-center two-run shot to Titan first baseman Taylor Bryant. After walking Timmy Richards, the Gauchos would go to their bullpen early.</p>\n<p>RHP Steven Ledesma, who has been lights out as of late before coming into Sunday’s matchup, was put in. After throwing 1.1 innings Friday and .2 innings Saturday, the transfer junior from Santa Barbara City College was noticeably tired while warming up only hovering around 85 to 86 mph with his fastball, a mark 2 to 3 mph lower than usual for the righty.</p>\n<p>As a result of fatigue, Ledesma got teed off on. Hunter Cullen would hit a bases-clearing triple to left center scoring two. The next batter Chris Hudgins would continue with a two-run shot to left field scoring two more.</p>\n<p>After a Chris Prescott single, Scott Hurst would hit <em>another </em>home run to right field adding yet two more runs for the Titans. Ledesma would not last the inning after giving up six runs from five batters. Ben Brecht would come in and finish the inning one batter later. The Titans would score eight two-out runs via a triple and three home runs in the bottom of the 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos would score three runs, but had opportunity after opportunity to score and make the game interesting. UCSB bats would leave the bases loaded scoring no runs on two separate occasions with one out. Even worse, the Gauchos were 0 for 5 with runners on 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> in the game. Although Kenny Corey would go 3 for 4, he would never be up with runners in scoring position resulting in no RBIS for the Gaucho 3<sup>rd</sup> baseman.</p>\n<p>Two more home runs and a triple would come again later in the game for the Titans resulting in the final score of 12 to 3. In total, even though collecting 14 hits, all runs produced for the Titans came on the five home runs and two triples given up. In the route, Lincoln (1-3) would get the loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to move on from the beat down and face the Trojans at the USC Wednesday night at 6 p.m. With using five arms including the usual midweek starter in Brecht Sunday, it will be interesting to see who the Gauchos will have left to throw considering a big Cal Poly series on the horizon at the end of the week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/","id":4114,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Denholm was able to comfortably work his way through the lineup solidly in control, striking out batters when he wasn’t getting the Gauchos to hit into his waiting defense.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior Sam Cohen would break Denholm’s hitless streak with a single to right field, putting men on first and second after sophomore Eric Yang reached first getting hit by a pitch. ‘</p>\n<p>The sophomore would cross the plate on a Denholm wild pitch which would be the only run the Gauchos could muster in the match, unable to match the nine-run effort given a game previously.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters would win the game 11-1, after tacking on two more runs in the sixth and eighth innings. Brendan Brooks finished the game leading everyone in RBIs with four and tying with senior Parker Coss in Anteaters hits with three.</p>\n<p>The entire home team showed up at the plate and UCI was able to enjoy their second victory scoring ten runs or more in the series. The stellar pitching from Denholm only made the win that much more sweeter for Head Coach Mike Gillespie who couldn’t have asked for a better Sunday game of baseball from his team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to regroup in Los Angeles as they continue on with their seven game road trip and hope to escape with a positive record, despite starting out 1-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the University of Southern California Trojans on Tuesday, April 16 at 6 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/","id":4111,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4110,4109,4108],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Your Home Becomes a Parking Violation: Large-Vehicle Restrictions Affect Isla Vistans","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"All oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For third-year sociology major Erin Joy, the chance to live in a van in Isla Vista was one they were looking forward to having.

She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students. We want to be supportive and helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:01 a.m.]: Joy uses they/them pronouns.

id=\"caption-attachment-91151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament drew a large number of players and spectators.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><em>Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Mustangs brought an aggressive push that resulted in an early lead, one that UCSB ultimately was unable to overcome. The final score was 11-2, with the Mustangs taking home the championship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came here to play with some of the best people around and improve my game,” said Miguel Del Real, a second-year student at Cal Poly hailing from Santa Cruz. Del Real has been playing beer die since his sophomore year in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s my second year coming here, and you know, Santa Barbara’s kind of the place to be for this stuff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament, held at the Kappa Sigma fraternity sand pit, drew a large number of players and spectators. Its host, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dyeislife, was founded in 2015 by Tanner Guisness, a marketing major who studied at the University of Colorado Boulder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness said he began playing beer die in his sophomore year of college and discovered his passion for the game through his time in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduation, Guisness started an Instagram page </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> @dyeislife </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which grew rapidly as he went from college to college and currently boasts over 91 thousand followers. Now, Dyeislife is a business that he runs with his partner Jack Hagerty, a former SBCC student, that manages die beer die tournaments across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness primarily manages tournaments at East Coast colleges such as Penn State and Clemson University while Hagerty handles the majority of the northern California events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just spreading the gospel of die across the country,” Hagerty said. “We just want to teach the kids what’s good. I mean, look at this energy, it’s so electric.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My goal is to have every backyard set up with a die table,” Guisness added. “Sand, astro, turf? Doesn’t matter, man, I just want kids playing this game. A lot of people think it’s bad because people are drinking, but hey, better beer than chugging a whole handle by yourself, you know what I mean? At least here with die, there are rules and you have to space it out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gusiness and Hagerty also mentioned that Kappa Sigma was instrumental in getting the event off its feet; the fraternity inspected the sand pits to be free of glass and set up the tables up for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reactions to the event were also very positive, with many non-SB natives complimenting Santa Barbara’s locale, vibe and weather, Hagerty said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite playing the game for years, Gusiness still finds himself reminiscing about Santa Barbara: its weather, picturesque environment and — not to mention — the joys of spreading beer die spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one does it quite like Santa Barbara,” Gusiness said. “I mean, look around. Beautiful blue skies, tons of dudes, tons of beer and tons of die sports. It’s a beautiful thing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/die-up-cal-poly-and-ucsb-face-off-at-beer-die-tournament/","id":4113,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[4112,4111,4110],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
