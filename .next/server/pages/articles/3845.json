She drunkenly informed the officers she was going to a nearby sorority.</p>\n<p>Despite being unable to complete her ABCs, the deputies allowed the inebriated 18-year-old to go after instructing her to walk straight to the sorority with a man she indicated was her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>The officers then rode their bikes a block away and turned to watch the drunken sorority sister. Instead of walking toward her sorority, however, the young woman and her boy-toy – driven by the drunchies – headed straight for Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies stopped the pair again and reminded the hungry girl of her instructions. After another failed alphabet test, the deputies let her go once more and continued to watch.</p>\n<p>The pair then walked toward campus and headed into the Pardall tunnel. The deputies stopped her for a third time and asked what she was doing. This time, she informed the officers that she was returning to her dorm room.</p>\n<p>The deputies explained that this was their third time talking with her and asked her how much she had imbibed. She responded by saying, “More than I should have.” At this point, the officers had no option but to arrest her, which they did.</p>\n<p>She was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>But I’m Just Drunk</p>\n<p>Fri., Nov. 21, 5:55 p.m. — A man was spotted stumbling down the sidewalk in front of Berrilicious, forcing Isla Vista’s finest into action.</p>\n<p>Deputies watched as the older male attempted to put one foot in front of the other without much success. On several occasions, the inebriated man lost his balance and nearly fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers stopped the 43-year-old transient and immediately concluded he was exceedingly intoxicated.</p>\n<p>When the deputies attempted to question him, his words were so severely slurred that he could not be understood. After several failed attempts at human conversation, the day-drinking drunk finally admitting to drinking “a beer.” The officers concluded he was either an extreme lightweight, or he was lying about his consumption.</p>\n<p>Either way, a few minutes later he stated that all he had done was “get drunk” and could not understand why he was getting arrested. The officers calmly explained that public intoxication was a crime and subsequently arrested him. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Dare to D.A.R.E.</p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 22, 5:15 p.m. — An officer was on duty at UCSB’s Robertson Gym when he was informed that someone may have been jumping on the hood of a D.A.R.E. patrol car.</p>\n<p>As the deputy was walking out to the car, he noticed a middle-aged male moving away from the vehicle. He stopped the suspect and detained him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the 36-year-old man what he was doing, but the individual said nothing at first. The deputy asked again, and the suspect said, “I was going to smash the D.A.R.E. vehicle.” He then went on to say, “I wanted to talk to Gregg Wilson so I could see my old swim records. They wouldn’t let me so I jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. I told them I was going to smash it.”</p>\n<p>When asked what the D.A.R.E. car had to do with Gregg Wilson, the seemingly sober man said, “I’m the named assistant swim coach for Gregg Wilson,” and offered no other reasoning.</p>\n<p>The deputy then inspected the car and noticed that the suspect had caused two small dents in the hood.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed the man under arrest and escorted him to his patrol car. Still not understanding, the officer asked once more why the man had jumped on the D.A.R.E. car. The swim-obsessed man replied that he was upset because he couldn’t see his old records. When asked again why jumping on the car had anything to do with seeing the swim records, he said, “I don’t know, I was upset.”</p>\n<p>The man was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending anger management.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17889\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17889\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-11-26/police-blotter-32/","id":3845,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3844,3843,3842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. -- A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Puking Princess</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. — A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>As the deputies made their way toward the crowd, they spotted the group’s focal point: a young lady bent over vomiting in the grass. Several of the men had their phones out and were taking pictures.</p>\n<p>The deputies then watched as the inebriated 18-year-old pushed herself up only to slip and fall face first into a pile of her own sick.</p>\n<p>Wiping the vomit from her face, the drunken female righted herself and started to walk off, completely unaware she was being followed by the police.</p>\n<p>A deputy grabbed her by the arm and tried to talk with the puking princess, but she was utterly unaware of her surroundings, making for bad conversation. Given that everyone else had scattered upon their arrival, the officers decided it was best to arrest her and transport her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Parking Lot Blues</b></p>\n<p>Sat. Oct. 17, 2:30 a.m. — Residents of 781 Embarcadero Del Norte were rudely awoken early Saturday morning to the obnoxious antics of one especially intoxicated partier.</p>\n<p>According to the reporting party, the 20-year-old male had stumbled up to the apartment complex, of which he was not a tenant, and then proceeded to kick and bang on several apartment doors.</p>\n<p>The young man’s run as the most insufferable idiot on the block was short lived, however. When officers arrived some minutes later, they found the rambunctious reveler passed out cold in the parking lot behind the building.</p>\n<p>The deputies attempted to rouse the sleepy squatter but he was unable to do anything but crawl around on all fours. And if that weren’t enough proof, the large urine stains on the man’s jeans suggested he was too drunk to take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Despite his self-professed desire to sleep in the parking lot, the officers offered something more comfortable, albeit just barely, and transported the infantile student to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Just a Beer… or 10</b></p>\n<p>Fri.

His cover was blown, however, when he told the deputies he lived at 3022 Trigo Rd., which, unfortunately, does not exist.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Jail, however, certainly exists and was happy to house the lost boy, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/","id":3842,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3841,3840,3839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Could You Help Me Zip Up?\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. - Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Could You Help Me Zip Up?<br>\nSat., Jan. 10, 1:02 a.m. – Deputies on a Friday night patrol watched as an inebriated young man stumbled through the front yard of 6662 Del Playa Dr., seemingly searching for a place to relieve himself.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old man found a wall, unzipped and started to drunkenly write his name in urine on the bricks. The officer approached the man and stood behind him as he finished. Ten seconds later, the man was done peeing and face to face with Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The officer escorted him to the curb and asked for his name and date of birth. The piss-drunk pee-er told the officers his name was George Douglas McClaren – a fake – and that his date of birth was 9-21-88 – also fake.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it didn’t take the officer long to determine he was being lied to and even less time to the arrest the dishonest urinator.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the drunken reveler was transported to the Isla Vista Station while the arrested deputy did the paperwork. A minute later, the dams burst open and Mr. McClaren vomited all over himself and the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy placed him outside, where he continued to intermediately upchuck on himself. Then the 20-year-old sat motionless with his eyes closed and pissed himself.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Have You Seen My Wife?<br>\nFri., Jan. 2, 4:43 a.m. – Officers working the late shift received a report of two middle-aged men hiding in and shouting from the bushes in front of 6621 Abrego Rd.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the deputies spotted the two men walking westbound down Abrego. The officers contacted the former bush-lovers, and one of them – a heavily intoxicated 58-year-old – immediately became argumentative and combative.</p>\n<p>Since his age was clearly not a concern, the deputies started by asking why the man was out walking around I.V. at 5 in the morning. His answer was frank, albeit completely untrue. He told the officers he had gotten into a fight with his wife earlier in the night and that she had kicked him out of the house.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that he had been trying to walk his intoxicated friend home when they fell into the bushes.</p>\n<p>A quick call to the Mrs., however, revealed a much different story. She told the officers that she and her husband no longer lived together and that he was currently residing in downtown Santa Barbara. The estranged wife added that her husband had also taken to sleeping in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park with the local transient population.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the officers had plenty to work with and arrested the twiggy man, transporting him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You Guys Got a Light?<br>\nMon., Jan. 12, 1:49 a.m. – While on patrol, two officers spotted a man staggering down the middle of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The two officers stood at the corner of Abrego and Camino Del Sur and watched as the man approached. The clearly inebriated man then proceeded to stumble into the middle of the intersection – with two cars fast approaching – and addressed the deputies.</p>\n<p>“You got a light for my cigarette?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The officers kindly asked the man to walk out of the street. The 31-year-old SBCC student refused, however, and shouted, “Fuck you guys,” at the officers.</p>\n<p>Even though the cops had ignored his request for a light, shouting profanities at the police – especially when drunk – is almost never a smart call. The officers walked over to the man, took him by the arm and escorted him to the sidewalk. Once there, they arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-13/police-blotter-33/","id":3843,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3842,3841,3840],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Bringing Down the House\n\nFri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Bringing Down the House</p>\n<p>Fri., Jan. 16, 11:56 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive witnessed two young men climb through the window into an abandoned house.</p>\n<p>Once inside the house, the two inebriated men were overtaken by drunken douchebaggery. The deputies watched as they proceeded to destroy an assortment of objects in the house by throwing them to the ground.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the two troublemakers made for the backdoor and out into the backyard. While one of the males was able to get away, the second got tripped up and fell into the arms of the law.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the intoxicated man why he was in the abandoned house and he replied, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.” Confused, the officer asked a second time but the man just repeated himself, “Physic, directed, mutant, genesis.”</p>\n<p>Having taken note of his strange answer, the officer then asked the 23-year old to recite his alphabet. “A, B, C,” he started, “E, G, H, I, H, Z.”</p>\n<p>Feeling certain the man was too intoxicated to take care of himself, the officers arrested and transported him to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station. While waiting for his paperwork to be completed, the man was placed on a chair in the station’s drunk tank. However, he was too drunk to sit in a chair properly, and, after a few minutes, he fell off the chair and landed on the side of his head, which caused a few small abrasions on his ear and cheek.</p>\n<p>The man was treated for his injuries and then taken to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Go Slugs!</p>\n<p>Sat., Jan 17, 3:08 a.m. – An intoxicated female nearly got run over by two officers driving their patrol car on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year old woman was stumbling down the street with her head down and apparently did not see the approaching police car. Just as the car was about to pass, the inebriated stroller staggered to the side and directly in front of the squad car.</p>\n<p>The officers hit the brakes and backed up the vehicle to talk with the drunken UC Santa Cruz student. The deputies tried to ask the young lady about her condition but had trouble understanding her answers. It seemed to the deputy that the woman’s mouth was filled with something and he asked why. She told the officer she had “cottonmouth” and when asked why she said, “‘Cause there was so much to drink.”</p>\n<p>While she was able to correctly recite her alphabet, the drunken out-of-towner was otherwise at a total loss. She could not understand why she was talking with the police or why they were asking so many questions.</p>\n<p>Despite her confusion, the officers asked the woman, who weighed about 120 pounds, how much alcohol she had consumed. She replied, “Seven shots of vodka and five beers.” With ample evidence, the deputies arrested the Banana Slug for public intoxication and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending a good salting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-18112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-18112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-01-23/police-blotter-34/","id":3844,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3843,3842,3841],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
