With many UCSB students coming from an immigrant background, often with relatives who had never heard of Thanksgiving prior coming to the United States, their Thanksgivings reflect a diverse cultural background.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spoke with students who immigrated or have parents who immigrated to the U.S. to learn how they integrate their families’ traditions with those of the customary Thanksgiving practices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Alejandro Stawsky said when his parents first migrated to the U.S. from Uruguay, they didn’t originally celebrate Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we first came here, they had no idea what Thanksgiving was,” Stawsky said. “I would go to school and then I would come back home and ask, ‘Are we doing Thanksgiving?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stawsky said his family now mixes Thanksgiving traditions with its Jewish background by celebrating a Shabbat dinner, the Jewish Sabbath meal, on the Friday after Thanksgiving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During Shabbat, we incorporate Thanksgiving,” Stawsky said. “We make tortas de papa, bourekas, baba ghanoush and go around the table saying what we’re thankful for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year global studies and political science double major Kajol Raju said her Punjabi family spends Thanksgiving at her grandparents’ house with a meal of traditional Indian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have turkey, and my aunt makes a ham and mashed potatoes, and then my aunts or grandma will make Indian food like curry chicken or tandoori chicken, and we’ll have sweets like gulab jamun.” Raju said. “After, we throw on an Indian movie and dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year anthropology and art history double major Diana Torres Luevanos said for her Mexican family, the phrase “vamos a comer,” which means “let’s eat,” signifies Thanksgiving.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first arrived to the States, I didn’t really celebrate Thanksgiving how everyone did,” Torres Luevanos said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Torres Luevanos said today, though, Thanksgiving is an important family tradition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We now get together every year in our church and have a whole ceremony on giving thanks,” Torres Luevanos said. “Then we eat tamales, arroz, frijoles and a bunch of Mexican food; sometimes my sister even makes fresas con crema, which is strawberries and cream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year mathematics major Armin Mahini said he and his Iranian parents combine typical Thanksgiving dinner with Persian food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Typically we have tahdig, which is a crispy rice dish, but there’s also American food,” Mahini said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year biochemistry major Allysa Foot’s mother is Vietnamese and her father is Honduran. Foot said Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because it is one of the few occasions in which her family can “appreciate the differences” and celebrate the “beauty” behind the different cultures involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom’s side of the family will make seafood like crawfish and crab or clams and oysters … and my dad’s side of the family makes tamales or enchiladas,” Foot said. “They truly give thanks this way by being able to come together and embrace one another and their differences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foot said Thanksgiving reminds her of being “enveloped in a blanket.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re enveloped in this total complete warmth, and it’s comforting, and it’s safe and it’s beautiful,” Foot said. “It’s home. That’s what it is.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-combine-cultures-in-thanksgiving-traditions/","id":3636,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3635,3634,3633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis","biography":"Not available","articles":[2492,2523,2531,2558,2574,2597,2599,2622,2638,2657,3608,3616,3636,3855,3869,4600,4657],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"University of California Announces No Intention To Adjust Tuition Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tuition is set at a UC-wide level, and individual campuses do not have the authority to change it.

At UC Santa Barbara, for example, that includes an additional $103.50 RecCen2 Expansion fee, a $60.06 UCen Expansion fee and a $39.39 Transit System fee, </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among others.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was at home. I wasn’t using the library and I wasn’t using the gym and I wasn’t using the pool. But I was paying for it,” Brandmeyer, a third-year psychology major, said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she is frustrated by the UC’s dismissal of student pleas and petitions — one of which </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made rounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB in March — and for standing its ground on refusing to withhold student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most student fees are relatively small compared to the price of tuition, students who choose to foot the bill with loans will be forced to shell out “thousands and thousands of dollars” down the line as their loans compound, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very unsettled and I think it’s very hypocritical and revealing of what [the UC’s] true motive is,” she said. “At the end of the day, [they] just want to make money off us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC declined to comment on the litigation but </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/university-of-california-announces-no-intention-to-adjust-tuition-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/other-fee-information/payment-refunds.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar </span><a href=\"https://sundial.csun.edu/157547/news/csu-system-sued-for-refusing-to-refund-campus-related-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by a Sonoma State University student against the California State University system on Monday, a spokesperson for the CSU system said it will “vigorously defend against the lawsuit,” EdSource </span><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/students-sue-california-universities-over-fees-lost-amid-pandemic/630377\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said the UC’s ambivalent response in supporting students prompted her to take legal action and “to be the voice” for those who are financially impacted by having their student fees withheld. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re accepted into the University of California, they were like, ‘We’re on your side. We want you to succeed. We want you to do research. We’re here to guide you through your four years,’” Brandemeyer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But the minute you show up,” she added, “it’s kind of like, ‘Okay, well you’re on your own now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking note of the student response to the UC, Garcia said her law firm looked to </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-napolitano-refund-uc-campus-fees-for-spring-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student-generated petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fee reimbursements as a framework for what eventually developed into </span><a href=\"https://dicellolevitt.com/california-university-systems-sued-on-behalf-of-more-than-700000-students-for-refusing-to-refund-fees-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> class-action lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope to achieve the goals that the students have wanted all along,” she said. “If you’ve seen those change.org petitions that were started, there are thousands of students across the country who have signed onto those.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to ensure that the schools will stop charging fees for services that are no longer available and return the funds that they’re holding onto for services that haven’t been provided,” Garcia added. “That money belongs to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the court to make a decision, Garcia maintained that the “goal is ultimately to get the students their money back… no matter how long that takes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she has faith that she will win the lawsuit, noting the outpour of students who are working nearly full-time while balancing a packed schedule amidst the pandemic. With feelings of uncertainty, frustration and desperation in mind, “I think that a lot of people are going to be standing their ground with this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the point where a lot of people are saying enough is enough. [The UC] is saying ‘Oh, we’re saving this money for a rainy day,’” Brandmeyer said. “This is a rainy day.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

</span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">November 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Now, Title IX will only apply to sexual violence that occurs in university-owned off-campus buildings or “any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution,” such as a fraternity or sorority house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university owns and leases a handful of apartment buildings in Isla Vista, as well as 910 Embarcadero Del Mar, the site of Dublin’s Sports Grill and Precious Slut Tattoo Parlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that the “vast majority” of gender-based violence cases that C.A.R.E. sees occur in off-campus housing in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really concerned that there’s going to be cases that would have been eligible for Title IX [that] will no longer be eligible for those investigations,” Conway said in a phone interview. “But [I.V. is] just one less area that offenders can be accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, survivors of sexual assault can still report to local law enforcement such as the UC Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, or seek counseling from organizations like C.A.R.E., but will not be able to report the incident to the Title IX office if the sexual assault took place in I.V., Conway said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while university-sanctioned fraternity and sorority houses are officially recognized buildings within Title IX’s scope, the new regulations leave areas like fraternity satellite houses out of the university’s jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The new regulations] wouldn’t include those spaces … That’s really dangerous for our community, especially because we have so much off-campus housing that is not owned by the university,” said Alia Reynolds, the director of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said that the jurisdiction restrictions are a “ridiculous standard” that will impact safety in I.V.; the I.V. CSD board </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-15/i-v-csd-condemns-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protested the amendments in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> submitted to the Department of Education during the public comment period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you create a policy that requires the university to sort of draw a line around the areas where they have jurisdiction to investigate sexual violence and which areas that they do not, you are, by definition, discouraging survivors from coming forward and using the judicial tools that should be at their disposal to seek justice,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations also narrow the definition of sexual violence as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” — a definition first established by the 1999 Supreme Court case</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had not previously been used as Title IX’s definition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, under Obama-era policy, an incident had to be either severe, pervasive or objectively offensive to qualify as sexual harassment; under the new regulations, an incident must be considered all three in order to be under the umbrella of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said that the change from “or” to “and” may seem small, but the language change makes a large difference in what may be considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That would essentially mean that the instance [of sexual violence] — because it has to be severe and pervasive and objectively offensive — has to happen more than one time, which is the definition of pervasive. So it excludes a lot of instances of sexual harassment [with] this new definition,” Reynolds explained. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710641/PACAOS-Appendix-E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the UC Title IX policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, first-time occurences of dating violence, stalking and domestic violence are still included in the definition of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, universities will have to choose a universal evidentiary standard for handling sexual assault, either with the preponderance of the evidence standard or with the clear and convincing evidence standard for all cases. Previously, schools could use different standards in different cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preponderance of evidence standard requires that there is a 50.1% chance that the charges are true, while the clear and convincing evidence standard requires a higher threshold of 75.1%, according to Conway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Systemwide Title IX Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding which standard the university will use moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges and universities are also no longer required to designate most employees, such as professors or staff, as “mandatory reporters,” meaning they will no longer be required to report an incident of sexual violence to the Title IX office if they are informed of it. Instead, schools must now decide “which of their employees must, may, or must only with a student’s consent, report sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator,” according to the new regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes the change will lower the amount of cases reported but said that in her opinion, this particular addition to the Title IX policy isn’t entirely negative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some individuals disclose an instance of sexual assault to someone that they didn’t realize was a mandated reporter. And then those instances are reported and they wish they hadn’t been,” Reynolds explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mandatory reporters are essential to connecting students to the C.A.R.E. office, Conway said. She’s worried that this change will erase the work of faculty in connecting students to the services C.A.R.E. offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because you don’t have to report doesn’t mean it’s not the right thing to do to get that survivor connected with the resources and with an advocate,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, colleges can no longer use the single-investigator model — in which an investigator writes a report and concludes the case, but no hearing takes place — to investigate an incident of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under current California law, however, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-california-universities-title-ix-20190215-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities haven’t used the single-investigator model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since January 2019. Prior to January 2019, hearings of Title IX cases in California were conducted only in the appeal process, by either the complainant or the respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations permit live cross-examination of the complainant and the respondent by advisers and lawyers, but prohibits complainants and respondents from questioning each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marks a significant change from DeVos’ initial proposed policy in November 2018, which did allow for students to cross-examine each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that a downside to the hearing method, rather than the single-investigator method, is that cases will take longer to conclude, which, along with the additional trauma of a cross-examination, could further deter students from reporting. Conway said that while more students are accessing C.A.R.E. accessing than ever, she has already seen fewer C.A.R.E. clients choosing to go through the Title IX investigation process since the 2019 change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since DeVos’ announcement, several groups across the country have already pledged to fight the regulations in court, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-announces-new-rules-on-campus-sexual-assault-offering-more-rights-to-the-accused/2020/05/06/4d950c7c-8fa0-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Washington Post reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At UC Santa Barbara, student organizations have already started. Reynolds said that S.A.S.A. is working with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit organization for gender justice, and that some S.A.S.A. members are part of a newly formed national coalition against sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to work with them to try to bolster that national coalition so we can fight this on the national level as well as on the state level.” </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/12/2020, 09:21 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that a lower number of students accessing C.A.R.E. resources. This article has been corrected to state that more students are accessing C.A.R.E. resources, but fewer C.A.R.E. clients are choosing to go through Title IX investigation, according to Conway. </i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
