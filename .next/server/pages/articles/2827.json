Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.</p>\n<p>“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.</p>\n<p>“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.</p>\n<p>“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”</p>\n<p>According to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.</p>\n<p>“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.</p>\n<p>“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others. But this is happening because we have terrorist organizations that have left Israel with really no other way to keep its people safe. When terrorists put their weapons down and their hatred down, the wall comes down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major and engineering collegiate senator Jonathan Rothschild said he did not support the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I cannot applaud the decision for the resolution to not acknowledge a two-state solution,” Rothschild said. “What is so wrong with acknowledging Israel’s right to exist?”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Guy Singer said he was against the resolution because it did not reflect any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked for the past two years to build alternatives and to build roads of cooperation and making out investment system more socially, environmentally and governmentally more responsible, and these efforts have been met with nothing but disdain from the pro-BDS community,” Singer said. “Any divestment resolution in the future will have to incorporate the Jewish community in some way or another in order for it to work.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film and media studies and philosophy double major and Off-campus Senator Jenna Anderson said she supported the resolution, but wanted to see amendments made.</p>\n<p>“As you can see, most every senator has expressed concerns with the wording of this resolution,” Anderson said. “Maybe I’m an idealist, but I just don’t get why we can’t come together and fix certain parts of it just to make it a little bit more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said A.S. should look into changes such as including more numbers and looking into investments in other companies that might not be socially responsible.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we could include other countries as well,” Anderson said. “If we are focusing of Palestine then why can’t we add the other companies that we are invested in the other countries and not just focus on Israel?”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and history double major Proxy Senator Andrew Farkash said he supported the resolution as a way for the university to dissociate from a stance that favors one country over another.</p>\n<p>“Our investments as they are right now value Israeli lives over Palestinian lives,” Farkash said. “I think that taking our money out of this issue makes a statement that we don’t support human rights violations, but at some point it is just saying we don’t want our hands involved whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, it was hard for him to come out as a Jewish student in support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“It is difficult for me to sit here and say that I support this resolution, because I know and acknowledge and am so deeply connected to those histories,” Farkash said. “There are thousands of Jewish people like me who are coming out and saying we love our country, we love our ethnicity, we love our religion, but we don’t love the occupation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Title IX is intended to end sex discrimination in all areas of education and has been applied to cases regarding sexual harassment and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Melgoza’s sexual assault allegedly took place last year on Jan. 18, after which she filed for an investigation on Oct. 2014 after speaking to both Counseling and Psychology Services (C.A.P.S.)  and Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.)  in the Women’s Center about the assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Where Melgoza Says It Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the reason she did not file for investigation until seven months after first approaching Judicial Affairs was because of their reaction to her case. She said she was discouraged by the Judicial Affairs officials who claimed that her case might just be about the perpetrator’s lack of performance during sex.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I didn’t file the investigation on March 13 was because I was discouraged to file it because they told me that maybe it was just … bad sex … what the official had said was … ‘If he was drunk maybe he didn’t perform as well,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said Judicial Affairs discouraged her by pointing out that she did not have the evidence to win a case and that the process to file it would be lengthy.</p>\n<p>“They were saying, ‘Well it’s going to be a long process, where [there’s] not enough evidence, you’re not going to be able to win,’ and at that point I was very upset and angry… and at that point I was just like, ‘You know what, fine, I guess I won’t file it,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>After filing the investigation, Melgoza allegedly repeatedly asked Judicial Affairs to not allow her perpetrator to enter her workspace before they gave into her requests in November.</p>\n<p>“Finally, at the end of November, they ended up getting him out of my job,” Melgoza said. “If I didn’t demand it then they probably wouldn’t have listened to me. They would have just given up.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Case Conclusions and Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said it was decided by Judicial Affairs in January that she had enough evidence to file a charge against her perpetrator under Section 102.08 of the Student Code of Conduct, which allows campus regulations to apply to certain off-campus behaviors, including sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In January … I got a phone call from Judicial Affairs and they ended up telling me that, yes, there was enough evidence to file a charge of sexual assault which in the student code is code 102.08,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>An email sent from Sexual Violence Conduct Committee (SVCC) Co-Chairperson Miles Ashlock to Acting Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob revealed the Committee met on Feb. 6 to hear the charges against Melgoza’s assailant and voted 3-0 that there was “sufficient evidence” that her alleged perpetrator was “responsible for sexually assaulting” Melgoza.</p>\n<p>On March 2, Melgoza received the decision from Jacob that the alleged assailant would be suspended for the Spring and Summer quarters of 2015, meaning he would not take classes or be allowed on university property.</p>\n<p>“I waited 15 days for the Vice Chancellor to make her decision … and in the first week of March I received a letter and an email saying that my perpetrator was suspended for spring of 2015 and summer of 2015,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>The March email from Jacob stated the three-member Sexual Violence and Conduct Committee “recommended a two quarter suspension,” without explanation for how the punishment was determined to be appropriate for the crime. Jacob approved the verdict of the SVCC, finalizing the decision by writing, “I find that I concur with the Committee’s recommendation and therefore suspend you for two quarters,” the email read.</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, the alleged perpetrator was seen on campus by a friend in the first week of ring Quarter although she had the sanction in writing, indicating the Judicial Affairs was not enforcing the sanction on which they had decided.</p>\n<p>“Third day of my spring quarter, week one, one of my best friends … told me that she had seen him on campus,” Melgoza said. “In writing it clearly says that he cannot be anywhere affiliated with UCSB … the administration needs to know how to enforce their sanctions.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said although she would like to discuss a change of policies with Judicial Affairs, she is uncomfortable and will not be dealing with them regarding her own case any longer. Melgoza said she will be filing the Title IX complaint because many students go through the same process with Judicial Affairs and do not see justice.</p>\n<p>“I am done with Judicial Affairs. I would like to negotiate with them about policies and changes that need to be made but regarding my case I am not comfortable talking to them anymore,” Melgoza said. “I’m going to file Title IX because this is just an injustice and it happens to so many students.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she felt disrespected by the university for their mishandling of her sexual assault case.</p>\n<p>“I just felt completely not listened to and not respected by the institution as a whole because at the end of the day, I’ve been through every outlet possible … and I still haven’t had a result,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Soojin Ro said the sanction given to the perpetrator was not harsh enough and could not ensure that he does not sexually assault another person.</p>\n<p>“I think that the consequence for him is too weak since suspension isn’t enough to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Ro said.</p>\n<p>Ro also said however there are different degrees of sexual assault, and depending on the details of the crime there should be harsher or weaker punishments.</p>\n<p>“If there is a first, second and third degree in murder, then sexual assault also has different degrees that relates to different punishments, so it depends on the details of the case,” Ro said.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes Can Occur</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the only way change can occur in the system is through student pressure on the university to take action. She also added that this is difficult because it is a task that requires a lot of persistence.</p>\n<p>“If enough students file enough complaints and if they put more pressure onto the university then the university has to make changes,” Melgoza said, “because unfortunately the university does not feel the pressure because it is such a hard topic that it is draining.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, it is vital that mental health professionals and more C.A.R.E. advocates on campus are made available on campus for students in need.</p>\n<p>“Mental health is so important and we need to increase the amount of staff that we have in mental health because it is just very necessary- extremely necessary for students,” Melgoza said. “As well as more advocates in C.A.R.E. because only four advocates in C.A.R.E. is not enough for the amount of cases that are handled at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Director of Counseling and Psychological Services Jeanne Stanford has stated on the C.A.P.S. website that as a personal mission, she intends to make counseling easily accessible to any student in need of it, while also eliminating the shame some students feel when seeking counseling.</p>\n<p>“One of my main goals is to make counseling available and accessible to all students,” Stanford stated. “I also strongly believe in erasing the stigma sometimes associated with seeking help so that students … know that counseling is indeed meant for all of us.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, there are multiple campus groups that mean to help sexual assault survivors and assist student recovery from unhealthy romantic relationships.</p>\n<p>“We have two healing after-sexual assault groups,” Stanford said. “And we also have a group called Empowering Us: Finding Wellness in Romantic Relationships, which has been a group where people can explore unhealthy romantic relationships that they’ve been in.”</p>\n<p>Director of News and Media Relations for the Office of Public Affairs and Communications George Foulsham said in a press release that the university offers support services 24-hours a day, seven days a week through C.AR.E. He stated that C.A.R.E. can help students report misconduct through multiple options, including filing a complaint via Title IX, the police and Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>“The university provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through C.A.R.E., our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct. These support services are available 24/7,” Foulsham stated in an email. “C.A.R.E. advocates can help students understand and access reporting options through Title IX, police and the Office of Judicial Affairs.”</p>\n<p>Foulsham also said he hopes to continue discussion on concerns that have been raised to the attention of the university.</p>\n<p>“We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail,” Foulsham said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. is an ally to the survivor community on campus. She wants students to know that C.A.P.S. provides services to help student heal after instances of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is obviously an ally to the survivor community whether they’re male, female, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,” Stanford said. “We do believe in helping students … We have healing after sexual assault groups here and that’s a kind of service that C.A.P.S. provides.”</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 4 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62493\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62493\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/","id":2824,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2823,2822,2821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Candidates Engage Students in Q&A","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Candidates for the position of Associate Students (A.S.) off-campus senator answered questions from audience members in a series of two open forums Wednesday afternoon at the Hub.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62424\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62424\" data-attachment-id=\"62424\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/candidates-engage-students-in-qa/off-campus-sen-a-k-web_paris-cullen-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429101503\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Off Campus Sen A-K Web_Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62424\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Off-Campus-Sen-A-K-Web_Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Candidates for the A.S. off-campus senator positions were split by last name into the A-K group (pictured above) and the L-Z group in the Hub to answer questions.

Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine and I.V. self-governance. Nine of the 13 candidates running attended the forums, all of which were associated with Open People’s Party (OPP). The 13 candidates are competing for 12 available seats, each of which represent roughly 1,000 undergraduates who reside off-campus. Each candidate had one minute to answer each question during the 50-minute forum.</p>\n<p>In regard to student fee allocations, first-year undeclared student Natalie Jordan said she would like to implement a quarterly review to help students understand how A.S. uses fee revenues.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been talking to students almost all week,” Jordan said. “Something a lot of you don’t know is that you pay almost $200 every quarter into student fees that go into Associated Students to pay for things like take-out at Ortega, the bike paths and things like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science and sociology double major Austin Hechler also said he would work to make sure fee allocations are more transparent.</p>\n<p>“I would like to work with the Student Fees Advisory Committee to make sure that our fees are a lot more transparent,” Hechler said. “About 34 percent of our student fees go to 400 NCAA athletes, and I feel like we can reallocate those fees to services that are more available to the general population.”</p>\n<p>First-year history major Sasha Bates said he is concerned students do not understand how their fees are allocated nor how A.S. functions.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to have more talks between the students and the government, so you actually know where you money is going,” Bates said. “When I’m walking around in Isla Vista and talking to people they don’t actually know what the Senate does.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan also said she wants students to better understand A.S.’s role on-campus and expressed her desire to lobby for better public higher education funding.</p>\n<p>“My goals for next year is to increase involvement and awareness on our campus so students like you and I can get involved in the fight against the defunding of our education on the state level and to fight against tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Regarding the A.S. Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine, Hechler said the movement is an issue “out of the students’ hands” and “on the global level.”</p>\n<p>“It really doesn’t bring our campus together,” Hechler said. “Although it is a large issue, it is important to realize that a lot of the consequences from divesting or investing are not things that the university cannot really take a stand against.”</p>\n<p>Bates said A.S. should not have to decide how the University of California invests its funds.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s the role of universities to take stances on geopolitical issues,” Bates said. “I don’t think it’s the role of A.S. to decide what other people should do with their money or what political beliefs their money should represent, so I don’t think the university should support divestment.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she would be willing to express a position on the matter after further understanding the divestment issue.</p>\n<p>“I would be happy to listen to both sides,” Jordan said. “With further knowledge, in the future I would be able to make an educated decision on what we should do if this were to come up again.”</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan however, she supports the campus movement for UC to divest from companies committing human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza region.</p>\n<p>“I support this resolution and I would hope to see that the divestment discussion on the UCSB campus be much more inclusive than divisive,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the issue of divestment is beyond A.S.’s agenda, because a previous bill calling for an end to human rights abuses has already addressed the issue at hand.</p>\n<p>“There is a dialogue that our population has to have, but I don’t think a bill for or against divestment is the way to make that dialogue,” Constantino said. “We’ve already had a bill to stop funding for human rights abuses, which answered the question, so I don’t know why it keeps on coming up.”</p>\n<p>In regard to sexual assault, Bates said A.S.’s first step should be to educate students about sexual violence on campus.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a huge deal, and our rates of sexual violence are a lot higher than a lot of other campuses across the nation,” Bates said. “The best way to stop all of our issues of sexual violence is through awareness.”</p>\n<p>Hechler, who sits on the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) as Vice President of Communications, said he would bring in IFC to assist in his efforts to prevent sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I believe the most important issue with sexual assault and sexual violence is that not a lot of people are aware of it,” Hechler said. “I would like to begin with the Greek community by really making sure that everyone in the Greek community is aware of this issue, because if I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything.”</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she is a survivor of a sexual assault and would work to create change in the university process for handling sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>“I am a survivor of sexual assault on this campus,” Melgoza said. “I have been working effortlessly to make changes and awareness over and over and over again not only with students, because I am a part of Take Back the Night, but also as well regarding my own case. It is not easy exposing myself to everyone, and I am making sure that policy changes are made.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she would support OPP External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidate Paola Dela Cruz’s idea of creating a “safe space” at the Pardall Center to improve the Community Service Officer (CSO) program on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Something I feel extremely passionate about is the Pardall Safe Space for women at night,” Jordan said. “Also, I’d really like to expand the CSO program.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Erin Barnett also said he was in support of Dela Cruz’ ideas for space spaces for students in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to work with her to make sure that, if you’re uncomfortable or if you’re drunk and you don’t have a place to go home at night, you can go there,” Barnett said.</p>\n<p>Bates said A.S. should also address sexual violence by taking into account students’ frustrations with local police.</p>\n<p>“One of the most important things we can do to stop sexual violence in Isla Vista is reach out to the police,” Bates said. “I’d like to improve police relations and continue the forums we’ve been having with the pizza with police officers, and maybe even improve it to something on campus with more people.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Isabelle Ninh also wants to work to improve relations with local police.</p>\n<p>“I look forward to continuing that and making sure that when the police are out there, we as students do not feel threatened and they understand that we as students have a right to defend ourselves and that if they are going to police us it is for a very legitimate reason,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>Regarding Greek life, Jordan said the university should continue to not tolerate any misconduct from affiliated chapters within Greek life.</p>\n<p>“I personally think that hazing and things like that shouldn’t be tolerated on this campus,” Jordan said. “I think that UCSB has already take a pretty large stance on that, and this tradition should be continued.”</p>\n<p>The candidates also discussed I.V. housing issues and whether or not A.S. should purchase property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. should not buy property in I.V., but rather support making I.V. a Community Service District (CSD) through State Assembly member Das Williams’ I.V.<br>\nself-governance bill AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Property in Isla Vista is very expensive — probably some of the most expensive you can find in California — and that would not be a good way to spend our money,” Hechler said. “I think the way to go about this issue is to support AB 3 all the way to the county legislature.”</p>\n<p>Bates also said the purchase of I.V. property would be an inefficient use of A.S. funds and also supported I.V. self-governance bill AB 3.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing for almost all of the issues with housing in Isla Vista is self-governance,” Bates said. “The best way to get a hold of Isla Vista and actually make meaningful change in Isla Vista is by making Isla Vista into something more than just unincorporated.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnet, A.S. should support efforts to establish I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely need to support the AB 3 bill,” Barnett said. “People in Isla Vista need to be in control of where they live.”</p>\n<p>However, Barnet also said he would also support A.S. buying property in I.V. in order to address current student housing issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done a lot with property in Isla Vista, and I think the Pardall Center is a good example of that,” Barnett said. “I think it would be a good idea to be able to house students.”</p>\n<p>Jordan said she also fully supports A.S. buying property in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The acquisition of property in Isla Vista is actually extremely important for Associated Students,” Jordan said. “This would stop rent fluctuation by buying the property up, which would help low-income students.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said he supported A.S. buying property in I.V., as long as they consider how it might affect residents.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the university should take a bigger role in Isla Vista,” Constantino said. “My part as an off-campus senator will be to make sure to pressure the university in that the decisions they make and the property they buy or lease is made consciously.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she would address I.V. housing issues through informational workshops.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of housing issues, such as sometimes students don’t know how to sign a lease or are not informed,” Melgoza said. “I really want to make sure to set up workshops on that regarding housing.”</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 3 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The same rule applies in fantasy football. With the tail end of the season coming up, it’s time to think about bettering your team for the home stretch.</p>\n<p>A few things can define the player that you are looking for to improve your team. A buy-low candidate is a player who has either underachieved thus far or has struggled as of late, but has the potential to break out and finish off the season on a high note. And after all, fantasy seasons are won or lost in these coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Here are some potential buy-low candidates I think can finish out the season strong:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jahvid Best</p>\n<p>Best has been dealing with a turf toe injury and hasn’t recorded double-digit points or a touchdown since week two, when he had three.</p>\n<p>As we saw on Sunday, with Matthew Stafford back the Lions’ offense is about to become a whole lot better. Best will be a major beneficiary of Stafford’s play mainly because of his pass-catching ability. He is currently second behind Frank Gore in receiving yards by a running back this season. On Sunday, he had five receptions for 31 yards. His game-breaking speed makes him a candidate to take any run or pass to the house, and as the Lions’ offense improves and Best’s toe heals, expect great play from him.</p>\n<p>Ray Rice / Maurice Jones-Drew</p>\n<p>Lots of yards. Few touchdowns. It will certainly be difficult to get this owner to part with his first round pick, but if he is dumb enough to doubt that the scores will come, you should pounce on the opportunity to acquire either of these studs. Baltimore has relied too much on Joe Flacco and the passing offense, but will soon discover its identity as a run-first football team, with Rice being the main beneficiary.</p>\n<p>Jones-Drew may be harder to trade for, but his value will only go up from here on out. Just remember, down the stretch depth matters less and less. If you are looking to make a run for the playoffs, it’s all about your starting lineup, so even if you have to give up multiple players to acquire him, it will be worth it. The constant yardage guarantees steady production, and both Rice and Jones-Drew are guaranteed to touch the ball a certain number of times because they are vital to their teams’ offensive success.</p>\n<p>Knowshon Moreno</p>\n<p>Moreno’s value has been up and down all season, and he is just recently overcoming a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games earlier in the year. Moreno is by far the most talented player in a crowded Denver backfield and will show that in the coming weeks. Much like Best, his pass-catching ability makes him a great buy-low candidate, even if you don’t fully believe in his ability to run the football.</p>\n<p>The Broncos have a bye in week nine, so this may be the perfect time to target Moreno. Assuming Moreno will be healthy in week 10, Denver has a cupcake schedule heading down the stretch. They play St. Louis in week 12, before a fantasy-friendly playoff schedule of Arizona, Oakland and Houston in weeks 14-16.</p>\n<p>DeSean Jackson</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter who is playing quarterback for the Eagles — DeSean will get his. Jackson has actually put up better fantasy numbers with Vick at the helm, so this is good news with Vick set to start this week.</p>\n<p>The problem is Jackson’s health. He is still recovering from a brutal concussion and may not be ready to play this week. View this as a good thing. If you can convince his owner that he is not worth the trouble and trade for him on the discount, go for it. Once healthy, Jackson is a great #1 receiver with huge play potential, as he is another guy with game-breaking speed who can always take one to the house.</p>\n<p>Wes Welker</p>\n<p>He has 40 receptions through seven games this season — below his pace of over 110 receptions in each of his last three seasons (his first three with the Pats). He has 319 yards and three touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Brady has not needed to throw the ball lately for the Patriots to have success, but that will change. The Pats are a pass-first team and Welker will play well down the stretch. It is highly possible that he has been slowed down by his surgically repaired knee, but — barring any setbacks — shouldn’t that mean that he will only get better as the season progresses and his knee continues to heal?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush would like to invite anyone and everyone to come take a look at his crystal ball. It’s very, very shiny.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/sunday-funday-standouts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/sunday-funday-standouts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/sunday-funday-standouts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/sunday-funday-standouts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/sunday-funday-standouts/","id":2826,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2825,2824,2823],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
