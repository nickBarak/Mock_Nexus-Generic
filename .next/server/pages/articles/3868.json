The bill calls for an in-depth study of abandoned and unused oil wells concentrated along the Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County.<br>\nJackson said the bill was inspired by a recent influx of oil onto Summerland Beach, leading to health warnings and beach closures over the past year.</p>\n<p>“This bill is a direct response to the issues we’ve been dealing with in Summerland in the oil fields there, [particularly] as a result of the Becker on-shore well which has been a problem in the Summerland area for decades,” Jackson said. “It was a well that was abandoned many years ago and was improperly capped.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, failure to properly cap the Becker on-shore well has been causing problems that affect the surrounding ocean and beaches.</p>\n<p>“This past year, it was leaking so measurably that it was creating all sorts of problems both in terms of odor it was emitting, and the crude oil that was finding its way onto the beaches and making it difficult for people to enjoy the beaches and the ocean,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would allow the state to learn more about other oil wells along the California coast and about the issue of natural seepage.</p>\n<p>“This legislation requires that we study these wells to find out which ones are leaking and what it will take to cap them,” Jackson said. “Also importantly, we will study the whole issue of natural seepage to determine if there is any or more than a relatively absorbable amount.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said SB 900 would ensure that State Lands Commission receive the funds and resources necessary to learn more about abandoned wells and cap-leaking wells.</p>\n<p>“If State Lands, which has the jurisdiction, fails to get the funding they need to cap this particular well, we will insure somewhere in the process, sooner rather than later frankly, we’ll be able to obtain the funds necessary in order to cap that well,” Jackson said. “It also gives State Lands the authority to do an analysis on the nearly 200 abandoned wells along the coast.”</p>\n<p>SB 900 is the beginning of a continuing effort to combat uncapped oil wells among the California coast, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“This [bill] is the beginning of the effort. If we achieve a regular funding mechanism, we hope we can address at least $2 million worth of the problem and perhaps more as we know exactly the full extent of the problem,” Jackson said. “The full time frame is yet unknown because we don’t know the full extent of the problem.”<br>\nJackson said she hopes to move the bill through the process and to the governor’s desk by the end of the 2016 State Senate session, in September.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-bill-calls-for-capping-of-coastal-oil-wells/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-bill-calls-for-capping-of-coastal-oil-wells/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-bill-calls-for-capping-of-coastal-oil-wells/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-bill-calls-for-capping-of-coastal-oil-wells/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-bill-calls-for-capping-of-coastal-oil-wells/","id":3868,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[3867,3866,3865],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo","biography":"Not available","articles":[2532,2553,2572,2583,2594,2608,2634,2641,2651,2656,2663,2681,3868,4615],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Yes Store Hosts Annual Event Showcasing Artists","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shopping_Vicky-Munro-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shopping_Vicky-Munro-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Yes Store is an arts cooperative in Downtown Santa Barbara, open from November to December each year, which sells handmade goods from local artists.

The pop-up store has operated since 1968 and is run entirely by artists who apply each year to have their work featured. On Dec. 3 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the store is hosting its annual event to mark the first Thursday of December, featuring live music, wine and appetizers and allowing customers to meet the artists.</p>\n<p>Susan Dunbar, the current manager of the store and former UCSB student, said what makes The Yes Store special is cooperation and the “legwork that nobody sees.”</p>\n<p>“For me it’s just amazing to see everybody pull together in a big group and make it happen,” Dunbar said. “‘Cause we typically only have a week or two to build the desk, get your booths in, stock it and then we open.”</p>\n<p>Dunbar, who first began working for the store after graduating college in 1981, said she appreciates watching multiple generations of Santa Barbara locals enjoy the store.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique in the way that we’ve been doing this for so long, so we see families grow up and come back and bring their children and buy art,” Dunbar said.</p>\n<p>The Yes Store employee Wendy Wagner said she tries to create a connection between shoppers and artists.</p>\n<p>“I’m a floor sales person but I consider myself an artist facilitator,” Wagner said. “I try to encourage people to know a little bit about the artists when they’re looking at their work so that that might help them purchasing their little treasures from these people.”</p>\n<p>Wagner said the store has undergone considerable expansion since last year and is always encouraging new artists to join.</p>\n<p>“We have 10 new artists this year so there’s a lot of new product in the store; we’re really excited about that,” Wagner said. “We like the expansion process, and, if any artists are interested in being in The Yes Store, we have a book that you can sign your name and then be notified next year when the jury process begins.”</p>\n<p>Long-time customer Stella Larson said she loves the quality of the store’s products, as well as being able to give back to the Santa Barbara art community.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming at least 42 years and I always look for my favourite people and then I look for the new people; it’s a wonderful thing. It’s all local artisans, everything is handmade — it’s really wonderful quality,” Larson said. “It helps the artist and it helps keep art going in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Local resident Trina Diaz said the store is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“I grew up here and it’s been going on forever,” Diaz said, “Locals all know about the [The] Yes Store so they look forward to it every year.”</p>\n<p>Diaz added that the store is a great opportunity for local artists to gain more exposure.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wonderful place for local artists to display their talent and for people to come and see that from all over the world,” Diaz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

This year, KHK also hosted a car raffle and a silent auction, raising a total of $460,000.</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Chloe Allen said though some KHK members worried the concert would not have a good turnout, the event was successful.</p>\n<p>“When we saw people slowly coming in, we were scared that we were going to have a lot of empty seats and the energy wouldn’t be that great,” Allen said. “But after Johnnyswim came on, they did a great job of setting the tone for the night and when NEEDTOBREATHE came on, everyone was so into it.”</p>\n<p>KHK Director of Outreach and SMHS senior Olivia Jones said the event “crushed” the organization’s fundraising goal of $350,000.</p>\n<p>“I can confidently say that I have never been so proud in my entire life with how the concert turned out,” Jones said in email. “We were able to raise $461,000 this year, and that is something not many high school seniors can or ever will say.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Allison Bliss said she was surprised to see such a diverse crowd at the concert.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67273\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67273\" data-attachment-id=\"67273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-11/nonprofit-hosts-concert-to-benefit-children-in-need/kidshelpingkidssb_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452284265\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kids Helping Kids SB\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67273\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=500%2C334\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KidsHelpingKidsSB_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“There were so many different types of people in the crowd — people [from] different states even — and they all came together and their energy was amazing,” Bliss said. “I was personally in the crowd at the very end and everyone was just so hyped and happy to be there.”</p>\n<p>SMHS senior Emily Imperato said the event was successful due to KHK members’ hard work and cooperation.</p>\n<p>“The event went really well because so many people were working so hard backstage and through the entire thing and it executed perfectly,” Imperato said. “We got exactly what we were looking for, the stage looked great, the artists were great and so the hard work paid off.”</p>\n<p>Imperto said the silent auction on the second floor of the theater was “packed” with bidders.</p>\n<p>“It went really well and there were so many people bidding for so many items,” Imperato said. “All the items were donated to us, and every single bid — that money goes straight to kids locally and globally.”</p>\n<p>Granada Theater staff member Stephanie Staud said the event improved upon the previous year’s concert.</p>\n<p>“They were way better with their planning.

Theatre in Santa Barbara on Jan. 24 to speak about the education offered at Khan Academy.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy is a nonprofit educational organization that aims to provide free education through online videos and practice exercises. Khan, who holds degrees from MIT and Harvard and is a former hedge fund analyst, created the Academy in 2005 as a tool to help tutor his cousins and expanded the idea into a web-based educational organization.</p>\n<p>Roman Baratiak, Associate Director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, said in an email that Khan brings an optimistic message about the future of learning in relation to modern technology.</p>\n<p>“Arts &amp; Lectures invited Salman Khan because of his visionary work rethinking existing assumptions about education and his work connecting students to the digital age,” Baratiak said.</p>\n<p>Carina Salaiz, a second-year biology major, said Khan Academy videos often pertain to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education (S.T.E.M.) and were integral to her academic journey as a S.T.E.M. student.</p>\n<p>“I’ve used his videos so many times in the past for bio, calculus, chemistry,” Salaiz said. “They’re way more extensive and in-depth than other ‘how-to’ videos … you can find them on YouTube and they’re completely free.”</p>\n<p>Salaiz said Khan’s knowledge of technology helped make his program more accessible and understandable than any other educational organizations.</p>\n<p>“I feel like other nonprofit [organizations] need to step up their game and use more web outlets to reach out to more people,” Salaiz said. “It’s the easiest way and it’s cool how Khan utilizes that. I am definitely really inspired by his work.”</p>\n<p>Mao Chun Cheng, second-year political science major, said he appreciated Khan for using modern technology in a user-friendly way to assist students.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s a really honorable thing to want everybody to be educated,” Cheng said. “There’s no better way to reach out to kids struggling in school than YouTube videos and really nicely formatted websites.”</p>\n<p>Alyssa Sahu, second-year biology major, recounted the time when Khan visited her high school and said she appreciates how Khan opens up his program to students of all ages.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good speaker and he was really engaging,” Sahu said. “My friend’s little brother was actually featured on his website! I think Khan features smart kids once in a while to showcase kids that have used his program and have advanced in their own way.”</p>\n<p>Tickets for the lecture are available online or at the Arts &amp; Lectures ticket office on campus. Tickets are $16 for students and $28-$43 for the general public.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67384\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/khan-academy-creator-to-speak-on-education-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67384\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/khan-academy-creator-to-speak-on-education-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/khan-academy-creator-to-speak-on-education-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/khan-academy-creator-to-speak-on-education-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/khan-academy-creator-to-speak-on-education-program/","id":3867,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[3866,3865,3864],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
