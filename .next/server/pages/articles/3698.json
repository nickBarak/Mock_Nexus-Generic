He currently serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, of which he serves as the vice chair. Carbajal has sponsored 231 bills since his inauguration in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UCSB graduate, Carbajal previously served for 12 years as the Santa Barbara County 1st District Supervisor. One of Carbajal’s main issues is environmental protection; he serves on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Solutions Caucus, which aims to find bipartisan solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbjal has also been a strong supporter of pro-immigration legislation, fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA. </span></p>\n<p><b>Andrew Caldwell (Republican):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caldwell’s campaign is centered on providing better opportunities for workers and small businesses. In 1991, he founded the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business (COLAB), which now has 1,000 members in Santa Barbara County. He has also helped start similar COLAB groups in Imperial, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties. While Caldwell is running as a Republican, he told the Santa Maria Times in February that neither party is serving the needs of the people and that he would “represent the people here.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Kenneth Young (No Party Preference): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young’s background is in civil engineering. According to his website, two issues that prompted him to run for office are health care and tax issues. He believes that Congress needs to lower costs for working families in order to maintain a healthy workforce in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue Young has put at the forefront of his campaign is energy independence; he said he believes the United States should invest more funding in renewable energy research and find safer ways of dealing with nuclear waste rather than eliminating nuclear power altogether. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Assembly:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Charles W. Cole (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cole, the sole Republican candidate running for State Assembly and the youngest among all candidates at 22, is running on a conservative platform that includes fixing freeways, preserving Proposition 13, maintaining private health care and rolling back rent control, according to his campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Cole graduated from Santa Barbara High School and attended Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to study business, but left after his first year after he found “the PC culture not conducive to learning,” according to his campaign website. His father manages his campaign, which has roughly $10,000 in donations from friends and family. He currently works for a local PR business, according to a Noozhawk</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Elsa Granados (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados, executive director of the nonprofit Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, is running on a three-fold platform that includes social equality advocacy, women’s rights advocacy and preserving the environment and coastlines along the Central Coast, according to her campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she wins the seat, Granados told the Santa Maria Times that she would work to increase affordable housing, create more jobs, strengthen the education systems within the district and stop offshore drilling.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A longtime UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista community member,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud, the youngest Democrat in the race for assembly, is the current general manager for the Isla Vista Community Services District and board member on the SBCC Board of Trustees.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud is running on a platform of education reform and free tuition, universal health care, affordable housing and public transportation, criminal justice reform and support for indigeneous communities, according to his campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cathy Murillo (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Santa Barbara City mayor, a former journalist and city councilmember, Murillo is running on a platform that aims to preserve the environment, increase access to higher education and strengthen the middle class, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first term as the mayor of Santa Barbara, Murillo worked to ban single-use plastics, set a 100% renewable energy goal by 2030 and continued to employ integrated pest management in the city. She also negotiated a project labor agreement with the city for worker safety and fair pay, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jason Dominguez (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez is bringing his experience as an environmental lawyer and a former teacher to his campaign, advocating for greater response to climate change, according to his website. Dominguez has previously served as a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and Deputy City Attorney, and he has been on Santa Barbara City Council since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez was originally running for Assembly at the same time as re-election for the Santa Barbara City Council but lost the election in December 2019. If elected, he plans to expand his work from City Council on inclusionary housing and wants to create a rent-to-own program for tenants. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steve Bennett (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Supervisor Bennett is finishing his fifth term on the board; before that, he worked as a high school teacher and member of the Ventura City Council. One of his hallmark initiatives of the County Board of Supervisors is S.O.A.R., the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiative, which was recently re-ratified. Other key issues for Bennett include building affordable housing and alternative transportation, such as coastal bikeways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bennett recently received the endorsement of the Santa Barbara Independent, who said he “holds the dramatic edge of experience” and will advocate for environmental protection. </span></p>\n<p><b>Stephen Blum (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing himself as a “proud product of public schools,” Blum was a teacher for over 20 years before he served on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and California Community College League State Board. Blum is basing his campaign on small donors and not accepting donations over $100 from any individuals or groups in what he calls a “positive only” campaign, he said on his website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dawn Addis (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addis serves on the Morro Bay City Council and said on her website that her work as a mother, public educator and community organizer guides her actions. She is supportive of climate crisis legislation, aiming to address the climate crisis by expanding clean renewable energy sources. She also aims to increase jobs and small business growth, according to her campaign’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3rd District Supervisor:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Joan Hartmann </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Democrat): As the incumbent, Hartmann has been serving as the 3rd District representative — which contains Isla Vista, parts of Goleta, the Gaviota Coast and Santa Ynez — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has been a strong advocate for climate change legislation. Isla Vista counts for nearly a third of the population living within the district.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, Hartmann discussed how the Santa Barbara oil spill inspired her to enter into academia, then law and then into the role of Supervisor. She placed importance on UCSB faculty housing, said she is a “huge supporter” of unionized labor and supports regulated cannabis within the county. She has also worked with several members of the Isla Vista Community Services District, supported the creation of the district and has been endorsed by several directors as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bruce Porter: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Porter’s second time running for the 3rd District seat. He is running on a platform of investing in alternative energy, “[restoring] balance to county government,” reinvesting in public schools and implementing a “common sense” cannabis policy, according to </span><a href=\"http://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter has faced significant backlash in the past few months from Isla Vista residents and UCSB students for his alleged role in the creation of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/rock-the-vote-sb-declared-illegitimate-by-national-org-shuts-down-operations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization that allegedly was created to tip the scales in the supervisor race by causing low voter turnout. He did not attend the Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, bowing out of the forum four hours before it was set to begin, citing mismanagement on the part of the forum’s organizers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Karen Jones (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Jones’ second time running for the 3rd District seat, and she currently serves as a director on the Santa Ynez Community Services District.

She also prides herself on only accepting small donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Tuesday night’s Isla Vista town hall, she emphasized her identity as the “only native-born, only Republican” in the race. When asked about the UC COLA movements, she said that she is not a fan of organized labor and said she believes that salaries can be negotiated and worked out without a union.

She has also authored bills in the past two years on health issues, ranging from extending care for those affected by the Thomas Fire to setting a ceiling for anticancer medication.

He also supports reforming health care and supports Trump’s health care plan to allow a competitive market between health care companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels also attributes poverty and homelessness issues to a lack of affordable housing and wage increases for long-term employees. He prides himself on being a fiscal conservative.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anastasia Stone (Nonpartisan): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone has not held political office before and is hoping to serve Californians without answering to parties or special interests.

This accounts for a 38% overall decrease over the last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report further notes that there has been an increase in Part II — or non-violent — crimes.
