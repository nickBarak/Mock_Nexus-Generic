id=\"caption-attachment-86267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The theater troupe spent weeks before the event tabling in the Arbor and inviting students to attend the show. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe President, Jalia Carlton-Carew, said auditions and initial preparations for the production began mid-Fall Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though these pieces are from the ‘90s, they still hold truth because they were still pieces inspired by people’s lived experiences at that time,” Carlton-Carew, a third-year film and media studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The casting process produced an array of people who could accurately portray the stories in “The Vagina Monologues,” according to Carlton-Carew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we have random people who just saw the show, like maybe the year before… I was just so interested after watching the show my first year that I knew I had to be a part of it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Carlton-Carew handles most of the logistics of the production, she will also be performing a self-written Herstory entitled “When I Was Seven,” in which she discusses her personal experience of black femininity in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really important culturally for people to be aware of all the topics that we talk about because they play into a wide range of stories… Pieces from the original monologues still relate today,” Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe Vice President, Kate Rossb, said she was inspired to become part of the production when she first saw the show her freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, [the show is] about people. We do target the female experience, but we also target nonbinary folk,” Ross said. “A lot of our pieces reflect cisgender women and trans women — a real variety of people and diverse experiences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of a wide range of speakers, characters and actors makes “The Vagina Monologues” and Herstories influential on a college campus such as UCSB, Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a special quality about seeing familiar faces on stage performing, Ross noted, saying that one of the ways in which the monologues succeed is in their ability to portray a spectrum of perspectives through real and relatable people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easier to distance yourself when it’s someone else’s words coming out of people’s mouths, but when you’re seeing someone up there, telling their story, and they’re your peers or it’s your sister or your friend or your friend’s friend, it definitely connects you more [to the story],” Ross said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Vagina Monologues” also provide an space for open discussions about current political and social dilemmas. This is one of the most important contributions “The Vagina Monologues” makes to the community, Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given our political climate now, you can’t afford to say something is ‘not your problem,’ even if it doesn’t pertain to you directly because the world is so interconnected. You will feel some impact based on that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if you aren’t influenced by people’s stories and what they’re performing, it’s still good to be educated about what other people’s experiences are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Monologues often deal with issues faced by students at university and reveal insights about students’ experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day,” Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After months of preparation and refining, Carew, Ross and the rest of the UCSB Women’s Theatre Troupe will finally showcase the production this weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the show’s earnings will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, an organization that provides confidential counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault and their loved ones, and the One Billion Rising Campaign, a global movement that aims to end rape and sexual violence against women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In anticipation for the production, Ross is looking forward to finally seeing the pieces come to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing everyone perform their pieces is really inspiring. It really warms my heart to see how much passion everyone is bringing to their stories.”</span></p>\n<p>Tickets can be purchased at the Associated Students ticket office.</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

I was a good 10 to 15 feet from the plate and I tripped and fell on my face and got tagged out.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any pre-game rituals? Who has the weirdest on the team?</strong></p>\n<p>V: My better outings before the game I’ve tripped on something by accident and just fallen on my ass or hit my head or something. That would be my go-to pre-game ritual.</p>\n<p>Haddow: I just do everything the same. I clean my shoes the same way, put my pants on the same way, I do the same hitting routines; everything is the same. Trevor Whyte has these sliders that he wears underneath his pants that are like 15 years old. They are basically like strings that he wears. They’re probably the most disgusting thing I’ve seen, it’s really gross.</p>\n<p>V: Yeah, he doesn’t wash them.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite moment as a Gaucho?</strong></p>\n<p>H: Most recently I’d say that home run I hit against Pepperdine in the 15th inning. That was a pretty memorable moment for me.</p>\n<p>C: Mine was actually last year. I threw my first complete game shutout. This guy right here [Haddow] saved my ass; he robbed a home run in the ninth inning. That’s what got me it. That was definitely one of my favorite moments.</p>\n<p><strong>What other sport would you play if not baseball?</strong></p>\n<p>H: I played water polo in high school. I don’t know if I’d want to play that in college though; it was pretty tough. Maybe football; I could probably be a tight end or something like that.</p>\n<p>C: I would have tried to play football too. I was a quarterback back in like the Pop Warner days. I stopped in high school, but I would have loved to play.</p>\n<p>V: I’d say football too, but I’ll go different. I enjoy racing and stuff, so I’d try to get into NASCAR, maybe drifting or something like that.</p>\n<p><strong>If you could meet any person in the world, dead or alive, who would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>C: I’d love to meet Jack White from the White Stripes. He’s my favorite musician. I’d love to pick his brain.</p>\n<p>H: I think maybe Muhammad Ali. His presence, his cockiness, his prowess; he’s the greatest.</p>\n<p><strong>If you could eat only one food for the rest of your life, what would you eat?</strong></p>\n<p>C: I’d go with salmon. I’m a big fish guy. I love salmon and it’s good for you too.</p>\n<p>H: I’m going to go with a nice steak and potatoes. That’s the best.</p>\n<p>V: Lobster and steak. Lots of butter, no vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>If you could live in one place the rest of your life, where would you live?</strong></p>\n<p>H: There are these houses in San Diego right above Black’s Beach on this cliff overlooking the ocean, and that’s where I would want to live.</p>\n<p>C: I’d want to live in Malibu; those houses are really nice.</p>\n<p>V: I’d say Hope Ranch. It’s between here and Montecito. They’re all mansions, so I just wouldn’t leave.</p>\n<p><strong>What is one thing you could not live your life without?</strong></p>\n<p>H: Friends and family.</p>\n<p>C: The internet.</p>\n<p>H: Fantasy baseball.</p>\n<p>V: Friends and family for sure. And it’d be tough without marshmallows for sure … for some reason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/gaucho-baseball-record/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/gaucho-baseball-record/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/gaucho-baseball-record/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/gaucho-baseball-record/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/gaucho-baseball-record/","id":3169,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3168,3167,3166],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Editors Say Their Goodbyes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When ESPN’s Jim Rome visited our campus on Alumni Weekend at the beginning of the month, Mark and I were invited to his reception at the Intercollegiate Athletics Building.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When ESPN’s Jim Rome visited our campus on Alumni weekend at the beginning of the month, Mark and I were invited to his reception at the Intercollegiate Athletics building.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”Mark Bogard” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a rel=\"attachment wp-att-40254\" href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/mark-and-ravi/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"40254\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/mark-and-ravi/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI.jpg?fit=508%2C285&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"508,285\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MARK AND RAVI\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI.jpg?fit=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI.jpg?fit=508%2C285&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-40254\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI-250x140.jpg?resize=250%2C140\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MARK-AND-RAVI.jpg?w=508&amp;ssl=1 508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit] </span>After some orchestrated mingling (his handlers wouldn’t let him talk to us), Rome gave a quick speech before disappearing into a room to interview some UCSB basketball players, leaving the rest of us standing around with our wine glasses not knowing what to say to each other.

Needless to say, DARE didn’t pass.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rob Gym was leaking, the baseball field relied on Andy Gumps instead of real bathrooms and our track was deemed unusable by the Big West. Massari wanted to know how the school’s athletic program would get better without better facilities.</p>\n<p>He was right. Our facilities suck. Community colleges look better. Isla Vista Elementary looks better. Even Cal States look better — a fact that escapes the Gaucho Locos that chant “if you can’t go to school, go to State!” like we’re actually superior.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sports do seem to have a common theme. We get close, we upset higher-ranked teams in our conference during irrelevant regular season games and then we lose. The cycle continues. We had an unprecedented two teams (men’s volleyball and club rugby) make the national championships this season and we couldn’t close either game.</p>\n<p>So we debated: Which comes first, the facilities or the team?</p>\n<p>I said the team. Sorry, Massari.</p>\n<p>Money doesn’t care about soccer. Volleyball almost won, but money doesn’t care about volleyball, either. Or women’s sports.</p>\n<p>Money cares about football and men’s basketball. Maybe even baseball. We don’t have a football team, of course, and our basketball team seems content with tournament berths. They’re happy just to be under the nationally televised lights.</p>\n<p>You’re going to tell me that there isn’t one high-major caliber player down to come to UCSB for the beaches and the girls — in spite of some of our shoddier facilities? That nobody wants to be the guy to lead a team from a no-name conference to a Sweet 16? That the first time Gonzaga won a tournament game with a bunch of white guys was because they had superior talent?</p>\n<p>There’s too much complacency amongst some of the athletes and personnel in all Gaucho sports. Conference championships are great, but they should be expected. Dare to be great, like the ads say, and it will happen.</p>\n<p>In spite of the disappointments and a really awkward drive back from Berkeley after soccer lost, my year as a Sports Editor was one of the best and most challenging of my life. It’s been great. Thanks, <em>Nexus</em> staff, the News Girls outside my office who giggle way louder than necessary, readers who gave me shit, online commenter “Dailysuxass” and all of you who followed us following all these teams. I’ve learned a lot from all of you. </p>\n<p>Three dollars an hour was totally worth it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes/","id":3170,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[3169,3168,3167],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
