CDP’s are typically under the direct supervision of county governments, as is I.V., which is represented on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors by 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr. The only agency within I.V. that have any authority over the area is the I.V. Recreation and Parks District, which is responsible for I.V.’s numerous public parks.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">When the Board of Regents established Santa Barbara State College as the third campus of the UC system in 1944 and pursued further enrollment, the population of I.V. also began to grow. Despite this, the level of existing infrastructure remained relatively low until the 1960s, when the Board of Supervisors created a zoning committee for I.V. that allegedly allowed development to occur with looser restrictions, according to longtime resident Carmen Lodise.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>The 1970s: Isla Vista’s First Attempt at Self-Governance</b></span></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58903\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58903\" data-attachment-id=\"58903\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/iv-self-governance-feature-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-10.jpg?fit=1526%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1526,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"On Jan. 29, 1970, police beat a student, Chris Hall, during a rally outside present-day Cheadle Hall.

According to the book, a movement to give I.V. a stronger form of government manifested after several civil disturbances in the ‘69-‘70 academic year, which culminated in the infamous 1970 I.V. Bank of America burning and the deployment of National Guard troops to the area by then California Governor Ronald Reagan.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Several months after the bank burning, during a second civil unrest in April 1970, 21-year-old student Kevin Moran was shot and killed by police while trying to put out a fire on the steps of the rebuilt Bank of America building. After previously attributing the death to a sniper, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department admitted several days later that the killing of Moran was from an accidental discharge from a Santa Barbara Police officer’s rifle.</span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Following the bank burning, in April 1970 the Board of Regents established a seven person committee to determine the role of UC Santa Barbara in governing I.V. The commission issued a report in October of the same year that became popularly known as the Trow Report, after committee member Martin Trow, a UC Berkeley sociologist. The report contained seven recommendations for university involvement in I.V., among them directing UCSB to adopt policies recognizing I.V. as integral to student life, giving the campus vice chancellor authority over university services in I.V. and building university owned apartments for students in I.V. The report also said the university should act to encourage greater collaboration with the County in governing I.V. and that the size of the student population be limited to 1970 levels.</span></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58904\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58904\" data-attachment-id=\"58904\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/iv-self-governance-feature-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-11.jpg?fit=1565%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1565,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Between 2,000 and 3,000 students crowd the administration building during the second pro-Allen rally in as many days on Jan. 30, 1970.

Community Council (IVCC) was formed and officially recognized by the Board of Supervisors and the Board of Regents, both of which provided funding to the body, which took it upon itself to provide an open forum to allow Isla Vistans to democratically address issues faced by the area. According to Lodise’s book, the council would decide by consensus on actions they believed would serve I.V. and would then present them to various government entities, such as the university and the County. The council, made up of 11 representatives, split I.V. into eight precincts and gave each one a vote.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Among IVCC’s earliest actions included the establishment of various I.V. groups and partnerships between the university and the County. Among these included the establishment of bus passes for students with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, — a practice that continues today — the design and construction of Anisq’Oyo Park, and the establishment of I.V.’s only currently remaining governmental authority, the IVRPD. Various offshoots and commissions were established by the IVCC and included a police commission, a planning commission and an animal control commission. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Isla Vista’s Attempt at Cityhood Shutdown </b></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Lodise, cityhood was first on the minds of many residents following the 1970 Bank of America burning.</span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It was not unreasonable to incorporate all the area into a city,” Lodise said. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In </span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>A Citizen’s History</i></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, Lodise states over 80 percent of the I.V. electorate favored cityhood in an advisory election in 1972. Among the most significant actions taken by the IVCC however was the commission’s role in pushing for cityhood for I.V. and in submitting a proposal for cityhood in September 1973 to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a county entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governmental agencies. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In November of 1973, the Board of Regents, then-UC President Charles Hitch and university administration came out in opposition of including the campus in an incorporated I.V.

Mercurio led the team in hits last season and is currently hitting .400, while Carroll has the team’s only homerun so far.</p>\n<p>Mercurio and Carroll are but a few of the returning players from last season as 14 freshmen make up the Spartans’ 20 man roster. Nine players had first their collegiate appearances for San Jose last weekend in the weekend series against San Diego State.</p>\n<p>Among the notable appearances, two started on the mound and three players started in the lineup.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB will be playing away from home for the first time this season, the Gauchos have had relative success against the Spartans as of late. UCSB has a winning record against SJSU since 2010, going 9-6 overall and 4-2 when playing at the Spartans’ home field. In its last two seasons UCSB has swept the Spartans.</p>\n<p>In its previous game, the Gauchos relied on the arms of their bullpen after starting pitcher, sophomore Dylan Hecht, struggled with his command, giving up four walks and having two wild pitches in four innings played.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan came in relief and pitched three impressive innings, allowing just one runner to get on base and striking out five batters in three innings on the mound. Junior Greg Mahle and sophomore Dillion Tate came in the last two innings in relief.</p>\n<p>UCSB was relatively quiet on offense except for a momentum changing homerun by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa in the third inning. The three-run blast came as Cal State Bakersfield allowed two runners on base after previously not scoring on a bases loaded situation in the top half of the inning.</p>\n<p>The homerun was all UCSB needed to secure the win, but added additional runs in the sixth and eighth inning to seal the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will rely on a combination of a deep pitching rotation and small ball to counter San Jose’s home field advantage.</p>\n<p>Game time for the first game between the teams is for Friday at 6 p.m., with games on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, Hecht had his usual stuff on display against the Spartans.</p>\n<p>Hecht did not allow an earned run through six innings of work and walked only two batters with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the offense for the Gauchos was clicking from the beginning of the first inning. Sophomore designated hitter Robby Nesovic brought in two runs home on a hit and then scored on a single by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, giving the Gauchos a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Behind the arm of Hecht, UCSB tacked on to the lead in the second inning with one run, and an additional three more runs in the fourth inning. Santa Barbara added three more runs later in the game and won the contest 10-1.</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 3-5 from the plate with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s afternoon game was a close affair until the seventh inning, when SJSU broke a 3-3 deadlock. Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan gave up a hit and walk before being pulled out from the game.</p>\n<p>The Spartans loaded the bases after another walk allowed, putting catcher Kyle Gallegos at the plate. Gallegos hit a clutch double, giving San Jose a two-run lead going into the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara responded with two runs to even the match. However, UCSB put itself into a further hole in the bottom half of the inning when they allowed two more runs giving San Jose a 7-5 advantage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara could not come up with the needed runs in the final and dropped the decision.</p>\n<p>Despite getting 16 hits in the game, UCSB couldn’t get the timely hits it needed to pull ahead. Junior right fielder Scott Quilan had the best performance from the plate, going 3-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome took the mound for the Gauchos in the opening game of the series. The lefty threw six solid innings, giving up two earned runs, two walks and four strikeouts before being lifted.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got on the board in the second inning on a single by freshman outfielder Andrew Calica, who brought a runner home from third base. San Jose scored in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>Held scoreless for the next five innings, the Gauchos put a runner in scoring position with two outs, trailing by one run. Kuresa delivered the game-tying single UCSB needed that sent the game into extra innings.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless ninth inning pitched by sophomore Greg Mahle, the Gauchos started the tenth inning with a runner on second base after a walk and sacrifice. Nesovic came up to at-bat and doubled down the line to give UCSB the 3-2 win.</p>\n<p>The win extended the Gauchos’ win streak against the Spartans to eight games, dating back to the 2011 season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have another non-conference game on Tuesday against defending champion UCLA. Game time is scheduled for 6 p.m. in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54152\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-san-jose/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54152\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-san-jose/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-san-jose/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-san-jose/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-san-jose/","id":4693,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4692,4691,4690],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Defending Champs UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos beat UCLA 6-4 on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be a month away from conference season, but the UCSB baseball team sent a major statement to the Big West last night, defeating defending champion UCLA on the road 6-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-1 on the season with the win, with three of the victories coming away from home.

Mazza displayed control and kept hitters off-balanced for a majority of the game.</p>\n<p>As in previous wins, the UCSB relief pitchers came in and shut the door on the opposing hitters.</p>\n<p>After scoring on an unearned run in the seventh inning, the Bruins tried mounting a comeback in the next inning but junior Greg Mahle struck out the final two batters of the inning to end the rally.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the ninth inning, sophomore Dillon Tate came in as closer for his second save of the season. Tate began by striking out the first batter he faced on a 2-2 count, followed by striking out the next batter swinging. Tate finished off the game on a lineout to first base, giving the Gauchos their first win over UCLA since 2011.</p>\n<p>UCSB relief pitching delivered another impressive performance, combining for 3.1 innings pitched, two hits allowed, one earned run and four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos continued last weekend’s hitting surge, getting eight hits and converting on scoring opportunities in clutch situations against the Bruins.</p>\n<p>In its last three games, UCSB has totaled 43 hits with six different players getting RBIs.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next prepare for its first four-game homestand of the season against Princeton University beginning Friday, including a doubleheader on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of Feb. 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54191\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/ucsb-defeats-defending-champs-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54191\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/ucsb-defeats-defending-champs-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/ucsb-defeats-defending-champs-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/ucsb-defeats-defending-champs-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/ucsb-defeats-defending-champs-ucla/","id":4694,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4693,4692,4691],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
