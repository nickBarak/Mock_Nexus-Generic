CSD, expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” </span>Leonard<em> Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vending machine is intended to operate 24/7 and will likely be located outside the Isla Vista Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to Sir. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Sir said the roughly $14,000 refrigerated vending machine will be built by VendTek, a vending machine company that helps that allows customers to purchase items through a variety of different payment methods, according to the company’s </span><a href=\"https://www.vendtek.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir specifically picked VendTek because it would allow for qualified, low-income students’ perm numbers to be uploaded to the vending machine — all they would have to do is swipe their access card. For Santa Barbara City College and non-student low-income residents, Sir said VendTek will provide specially-made cards with barcodes so they can access the vending machine as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, Sir planned to have the vending machine stationed on campus, but, after working with UC Santa Barbara administration, she was informed that it would conflict with the school’s “vending machine contracts,” forcing her to take the project off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” However, Sir said the new vending machine will acquire food in a similar manner by obtaining “pre-made, unsold food items.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Bider, a third-year environmental studies major, worked with Sir to help find potential sources for food donations. Bider originally canvassed local restaurants such as Bagel Cafe, Buddha Bowls, Cajé, Woodstocks and Pizza My Heart to gauge their interest in donating to a food pantry. He assumed they would also express interest in donating to a vending machine with similar goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also reached out to the local Trader Joe’s and Amazon outlets, both of which expressed interest in making food donations in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir noted that “about 48% of UCSB undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed do not have a consistent source of high-quality, nutritious food.” When food pantries are closed, usually around 7 p.m. at the latest, there is nowhere else to obtain a free meal either on campus or in I.V., according to Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir believes the vending machine will also benefit students struggling with housing security, as some students do not have access to a dedicated kitchen to cook meals.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure proper health regulations when serving the repackaged food, Sir reached out to Kendra Wise, an environmental health specialist from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we are not profiting from this vending machine, we can register as a non-profit organization that’s distributing food.  [Wise] recommends that people who are going to help us get their training online to be able to handle this food and repackage it,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of our budget includes all the regulations of what we need to handle this food, and I will be working with Kendra Wise to make sure that this food will fit the Santa Barbara County health regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir placed heavy emphasis on the proposed vending machine’s location, because, unlike on-campus options such as the A.S. Food Bank, the vending machine will be open to non-student residents in I.V. — the only one of its kind.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 20, 10:56 a.m.]: A previous version of this article wrongly stated the vending machine would be purchased through the company VendTech, but has been corrected to the right company, VendTek. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Frontier Communications, a telecommunications company; and Utility Tree Service (UTS), a tree trimming company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, SoCal Edison entered into a “special use permit” (SUP) agreement with the federal government, agreeing to maintain land owned by the government by trimming branches and removing trees to prevent dangerous tree collapses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To carry out the agreement, the court complaint said SoCal Edison paid a tree trimming service, Utility Tree Service, to take care of its green space. UTS specializes in “utility line clearance work” and provides services such as vegetation management and storm and emergency response, </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitytreeservice.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the company’s website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to the court complaint, UTS inspected a faulty tree but allegedly made no effort to clear the hazard. The tree later collapsed on power and communication lines, belonging to SoCal Edison and Frontier Communications respectively, and ignited adjacent vegetation, the court complaint alleged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complaint also claims that Frontier Communications improperly maintained vegetation adjacent to its communication lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brush fire soon manifested into a forest fire, engulfing an area with a length equal to the distance from </span><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedImages/countyofsb/Content/Emergencies/reyMap08-30-16.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138648331\" data-slb-group=\"89672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista to Montecito.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among others, alleged damages to the land include “the mitigation, rehabilitation, and reforestation of burned areas; loss of and damage to timber, habitat, wildlife, watershed and earth protection… environmental damage… soil damage and erosion,” according to the court complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the SUP signed by SoCal Edison, the electrical company is mandated to compensate the National Forest Service for any damages incurred on the land, the court complaint alleged. After almost a month, the fire was extinguished but resulted in “suppression costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of $26 million,” the court complaint read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Aug. 17, the day the court complaint was filed, SoCal Edison allegedly had not paid “any part of the sum demanded by the United States” — an amount which was not disclosed in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal Edison, Frontier Communications and UTS did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November 2018, SoCal Edison </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-02/southern-california-edison-admits-to-being-a-source-of-the-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted to being one of the sources of the Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara County between December 2017 and January 2018 and ultimately burned over 281,893 acres of land.

Tragedy) was chosen for the director role because of her history of activism. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Collins Puente joined this seaside community as UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) community advisor. She was recruited for the position following the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/five-years-later-i-v-honors-victims-of-2014-shooting-with-recreation-of-original-vigil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2014 Isla Vista tragedy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because, as she put it, the community wanted to see tangible changes in the culture, social services and space in I.V.: “There was a strong need for healing from the tragedy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente credited her time at A.S. for preparing her for the role of the I.V. Community Center (IVCC) director. While working for A.S., she focused on community-based initiatives, tackling several projects and focusing on “solving everyday problems that the residents of Isla Vista faced, like tenant issues, eviction, mental health, alcohol and drugs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente, who was exposed to activism growing up as a child in Guatemala during its Civil War, was selected for her role based on her history as an activist, she said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the path toward creating the center, let alone hiring a director, was not linear; the building housing the first community center in I.V. was sold in the 1970s, and financial setbacks prevented the community from building another. It wasn’t until 2012, after the county </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/community-center-meets-pitfalls-success/?fbclid=IwAR3QaUeBMMhQK_y2x2568or0Cmjdyrxma-7hGTLh3PsmHbDRalDbqA86r1E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchased the center’s current location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 976 Embarcadero del Mar, that steps towards actively creating a new center began.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center will have a soft opening in October with a grand opening in either January or February 2020, according to an update posted to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Facebook page. Collins Puente officially began her position on Aug. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins Puente, the IVCC will act as a hub for I.V. residents, addressing the various needs of the community. Puente will work with the IVCC Advisory Board, which is currently being filled, to “ensure that the values and priorities of community members are thoughtfully taken into account in order to inform the strategic direction, vision, and programming of the new Community Center,” according to a press release sent out by the I.V. CSD board of directors in mid-July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory board will be composed of several members of the community, some of whom have already been elected by the I.V. CSD. At the Aug. 13 I.V. CSD meeting, the board voted to postpone its vote on the final non-profit seat on the board until its Aug. 27 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new IVCC director position is funded by a $177,000 one-year grant from the I.V. CSD to Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) in order to manage the development, fundraising, programming and strategic future of the center, the press release said. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said that Collin Puente’s experience with social justice through nonprofit work will help create a “collective vision” for the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been lucky to know and work with people in Isla Vista who are incredibly dedicated to building community – none more so than Diana Collins-Puente. As the Director of Community Affairs in Associated Students, she advised me and countless other students who sought to make a difference,” Brandt said in an email statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vistans have been fighting for a community center for over three decades, and I can’t think of a better person to implement our collective vision than Diana.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente has big plans for the future of the community center, hoping to balance the needs of the UCSB student population living in I.V. with the rest of the community. She hopes to craft the IVCC into a multi-use space, which would include hosting exercise and nutrition classes as well as a wide range of recreational and self-help activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a need for classrooms, so the space could potentially be used for that, while also providing a practical space for the rest of the community. Classes would be offered to them as well, ranging from legal classes to self-help classes, and we plan to include a demonstration kitchen,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente noted that plans for the IVCC are rooted in her involvement with the Pardall Center – a UCSB-operated collaborative space located in I.V. – for the last five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want the IVCC to do what the Pardall Center couldn’t,” Collins Puente said. “The needs of the community have simply been too large for the Pardall Center, so the IVCC will address the larger projects that can’t be sustained at the Pardall Center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collins Puente also plans to work with the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District, which will manage the recreational activities and play a role in the development of the space, alongside the IVYP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I intend for the community to feel a sense of co-ownership over the space so that it can contribute to being a model of collaboration,” Collins Puente said. “The center really speaks to the very unique nature of how I.V. has been able to support the building of institutions like the IVYP, the IVCC, and the I.V. CSD… It is a hub that brings together diverse members of the community that allows for us to engage with each other.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a pride in it being a community effort.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/a-community-effort-diana-collins-puente-selected-as-first-i-v-community-center-director/","id":3710,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[3709,3708,3707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Candidates Emerge for Vacant I.V.

CSD) Director Natalie Jordan. Jordan, who officially left in January 2019, previously told the <em>Nexus</em> that she felt it was time for “someone else to step into that position.”</p>\n<p>Jordan had served her original two-year term, but the terms of office had changed for her seat due to technicalities in election code.</p>\n<p>The individual who will fill Jordan’s empty seat will hold the position until December 2020.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD will interview all of the candidates and vote on who to select during Tuesday night’s meeting, which will begin at 4:30 p.m. The board previously extended the deadline to apply before the application period closed on Feb. 19.</p>\n<p>Previously, four candidates had applied; however, Goleta-based psychologist Jeremy Roark withdrew from the race on Monday, citing the “importance of student representation” for the board.</p>\n<p>The agenda for Tuesday’s meeting can be viewed <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/764548f33/2_26_19+Regular+Meeting+Agenda.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Overviews of the candidates’ qualifications and experience can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth-year economics and statistical science double major Jeremy Levine:</strong></p>\n<p>Levine described Isla Vista as “a little slice of paradise.”</p>\n<p>“It’s in a lot of ways a melting pot of different people and personalities getting to just pursue learning and living and having a good time,” Levine told the <em>Nexus</em>. “So why the CSD? I would like to represent these people, and I would like to make this place which I view as a little slice of paradise even closer to the ideal of what it could be.”</p>\n<p>Levine cited his financial experience both as an editor for The Bottom Line and as an intern for the Economic Forecast Project when asked what he believed he could bring to the board.</p>\n<p>“I think what makes me unique is my approach to solving issues here. It is a very solutions-driven approach. It is a process-driven approach,” he said.</p>\n<p>If chosen for the board, Levine would focus on gathering information from the community about their needs and then would want to use that data to plan the board’s priorities for the year.</p>\n<p>Levine also said he has a special interest in prioritizing environmental awareness and environmental justice in I.V., emphasizing his background as co-chair of the Environmental Awareness Board and his environmentally-friendly work in I.V. since he first arrived at UCSB.</p>\n<p>When asked about the board’s diversity, Levine admitted that he doesn’t quite “bring any diversity to the table,” noting that the board is currently all male and primarily white, and that the two other candidates might have more to offer in terms of their lived experiences.</p>\n<p>However, Levine believes that he could bridge that gap by prioritizing accessibility and outreach as a member of the board, and he hopes to ensure that the board elected by the end of his term in December 2020 will “look dramatically different from the current board” in diversity, socioeconomic background and role in I.V.</p>\n<p>Although Levine will graduate from UCSB in Spring 2019 with a double major in economics and statistical science, he plans to remain in I.V. to work at the California Center for Public Policy in Santa Barbara and, if elected, for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p><strong>Second-year pre-sociology major Kristie Nguyen:</strong></p>\n<p>In her resume, Nguyen describes herself as an “Isla Vista resident with a passion for politics and the community.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has become my home away from home, a community that I have grown a deep connection with,” she said in her cover letter, speaking of how she wants to represent both the students and the permanent I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“My goal is to make sure that every student and resident that is asked about their residency in Isla Vista is smiling because of their genuine care and love for it.”</p>\n<p>She has experience working in public relations for two UCSB organizations: Campus Democrats and Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She is currently Campus Democrats’ publicity director and is on the public relations committee in the Alpha Delta Pi sorority.</p>\n<p>She has also worked as an intern for Santa Barbara Mayor Cathy Murillo, for Congressman Salud Carbajal and for Assembly Member Monique Limon.</p>\n<p>Nguyen has prior involvement with the I.V. CSD’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>, where she worked as the publicity coordinator.</p>\n<p>In her cover letter, she pointed out that she would be the “the first and only woman of color on the board” – referring to the board’s currently all-male and majority white status – and that she would “offer diverse and beneficial input on the development of community, student representation, and women’s rights.”</p>\n<p>Her specific goals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing the number of CSOs on the 67 and 68 blocks of I.V., and have them “actively patrolling” areas that contain “active parties,” such as Del Playa Drive and fraternity neighborhoods;</li>\n<li>encouraging CSOs to be “more proactive” by asking residents if they need help rather than waiting for calls;<br>\ninstalling additional lighting in I.V., particularly on the further blocks;</li>\n<li>limiting I.V. parking to I.V. residents;</li>\n<li>promoting housing affordability;</li>\n<li>improving the I.V.
