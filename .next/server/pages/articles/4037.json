The university, however, has yet to make an official decision about the status of fall quarter instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think it’s out of the question,” Ali Javanbakht, interim Student Health service executive director and medical director, said in an interview. He’s been participating in almost-daily phone calls led by Chancellor Henry T. Yang, in which leaders from UCSB groups give updates and discuss the future of in-person instruction at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the general consensus is it’s not gonna be 100% in-person again. I don’t think anybody thinks that would be wise,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I don’t think that anybody thinks that having a completely remote fall quarter would be reasonable either. Most people are feeling like it would have to be some kind of in-between,” he added. “Some kind of hybrid.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind a hybrid-instruction quarter is to disrupt the transmission of coronavirus by reducing the opportunity for it to spread from person-to-person in close-contact environments like classrooms. Campbell Hall’s 900-person lectures and sections with students sitting desk-to-desk could be a thing of the past, at least for now, Javanbahkt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group, which includes leaders from all corners of the campus from Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises to the Academic Senate, is discussing ideas for new course structures and campus practices such as having in-person classes with smaller groups, face mask distribution to all students and faculty and single rooms for students living on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps need to be in place to limit how many times [and] how often different students congregate,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For hybrid classes, this could mean placing students in alternating groups for each course that switch between in-person instruction one day and remote instruction the next day, so that if a person in one class group gets sick, the virus would have less opportunity to spread to more people, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of face masks could also become a widespread practice on campus, as the working group is considering making them available to everyone who uses campus facilities. Implementing widespread use of face masks entails creating “the culture and the awareness” to encourage young people and students to use them, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For housing, UCSB is considering allowing only singles or doubles in its campus dorms and residence halls. However, there’s concern among the working group that there aren’t enough rooms available for this change, a problem that could potentially “push more people into Isla Vista, a place that we don’t have control over,” and where the spread of the virus could go unchecked, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said I.V.’s unique population of UCSB students, Santa Barbara City College students, working adults and families means the path to testing must be pursued collaboratively by both the university and the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The university] can certainly offer services and testing and give them to UCSB students in Isla Vista but that’s about half the Isla Vista population,” Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most scientists agree that the path to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">normal life starts with widespread community testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Santa Barbara County’s testing capacity has not extended beyond those who display symptoms or are at a high risk. Three new community </span><a href=\"https://publichealthsbc.org/testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testing sites opened up in the county on May 5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Santa Maria, Lompoc and Santa Barbara. Everyone is eligible for testing, but essential workers, members of the high-risk population and those exhibiting symptoms are being prioritized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county confirmed Isla Vista’s first case of coronavirus on March 30. Five weeks later, it remains I.V.’s only confirmed case. While other communities in the county have seen a rising  number of cases, I.V.’s count has been stagnant for over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of May 7, UCSB Student Health has administered 103 coronavirus tests; 102 tested negative and one was still pending at the time, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCSB Student Health has had to be “judicious” with its testing, Javanbakht said, since coronavirus tests are expensive — $60 per person — and in high demand and low supply. But testing needs to be expanded in order to get a sense of what the coronavirus spread looks like in the community, and as of now, Student Health services “is not set up to do that,” Javanbakht added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about broad big scale testing … to pave a path forward to resuming operations, that’s a very different scale,” Javanbakht said. “[We] don’t have the resources to do that. That’s more of a campus-wide level of operation that would need to happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic has administered 14 coronavirus tests in I.V. as of May 7, but none have come back positive, according to Charles Fenzi, the chief executive officer and chief medical officer at the clinic. The clinic normally serves around 5,000 people, a number that usually goes down in the summer when students flock back to their hometowns, Fenzi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that I.V. is not seeing dramatic increases in coronavirus cases due to students returning home amid the move to online instruction, according to Fenzi. When students return, however, he said that the campus will likely need to look much different than normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s gonna be a real push if we allow people back on campus to [return] in a way that is safe for everybody so the social distancing thing is going to be a fact of life for a long time,” Fenzi said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said overcrowding of residents in I.V. is a complicating factor in slowing the spread of coronavirus and one that will make the university’s decision on housing more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt is working with I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud and the county on a reopening planning group to draft guidelines and practices for the reopening of the economy and the education sectors in I.V., including Isla Vista Elementary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the county’s goal is to increase testing, Brandt said “it’s a slow process.” </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/05/01/santa-barbara-county-begins-community-testing-for-covid-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three new testing sites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have brought the county up to about 200 tests per day since they opened, Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he believes “many people in Isla Vista have been infected with COVID-19 but we either did not have the test at the time or they were just not prioritized for the testing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While communities across </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-08/these-are-the-california-businesses-that-can-reopen-and-these-are-the-rules\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California begin tiptoeing into the reopening process</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the picture of the coronavirus spread in I.V. remains murky. Javanbakht said the single case of coronavirus confirmed in I.V. since March 30 could mean “we just don’t have that many [cases] on campus or in Isla Vista” or “that we just haven’t tested the right people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reality of the coronavirus spread in I.V. could have huge implications in the future for Isla Vistans and UCSB students, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you take a community and you test them and the positive rates are really low, is it because COVID hasn’t come there at all? Or is it because it came and spread and it went,” Javanbakht said, “and those are very different dynamics.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation</span>. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local food-based services, such as Food Not Bombs, the I.V. Food Co-op, the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank and Manos de Mapaches, are contributing to the flurry of local support that has come out of the coronavirus pandemic with new and improved services, such as daily meal distributions and grocery pick-up programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs, a long-standing organization in I.V., has grown to meet the community’s demand for food access. The organization usually produces two meals per week but now produces five, which volunteers hand out in various parks in I.V. for those facing food insecurity, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under normal circumstances, Food Not Bombs serves free vegan meals twice a week, in which most of its food comes free from local growers and markets, such as the Goleta Farmers Market and the I.V. Food Co-op, according to Jonathan Dickstein, a religious studies graduate student who has been volunteering at Food Not Bombs for over a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of Food Not Bombs’ normal operations involves group cooking, but volunteers have now shifted operations to cooking separately while in isolation, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fnbiv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Not Bombs recently partnered with I.V. Food Co-op on April 28, purchasing the store’s packaged sandwiches, fruits, snacks and drinks to be distributed by Food Not Bombs’ volunteers at a lower cost, according to Melissa Cohen, the store’s general manager. In distributing food to community members, Dickstein said Food Not Bombs operates under the framework that “food is a right, not a privilege.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op is one of a handful of grocery stores in I.V. and has been relied on by many, especially now that access to larger grocery stores outside of I.V. may be a hurdle for community members in isolation, according to Cohen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Food Co-op has made efforts to ensure that customers who are practicing social distancing have access to groceries, such as making its inventory accessible through an online platform known as </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/?fbclid=IwAR2onQTi2MT53jva0gL07GzPez42-r5g-V6C_XIoADg9s-kLXc0czx_pAiQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-op Curbside</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Customers can purchase their groceries online and have them bagged and brought to the curb for pickup at a time of their choosing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new program also provides services to those who are homebound and unable to pick up groceries at the store. Through contacting the I.V. Food Co-op, customers from  high-risk demographics can arrange a home delivery to minimize contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There aren’t formulas for this; these are people developing all of these programs in [real] time. It is all very people-powered,” Cohen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the I.V. Food Co-op has not been immune to the new pressures that the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing orders place on grocery stores and other essential services, Cohen said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have run the Co-op for 10 years, through shootings and riots and wildfires, and this has been as hard as everything combined together,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from Food Not Bombs and the I.V. Food Co-op, other local programs have stepped up to the challenge of combating food insecurity during this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches, an organization based in I.V. that was created on April 15 by UC Santa Barbara students, is also delivering groceries and supplies to those most vulnerable in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is working to address the needs of the elderly, disabled and immunocompromised by pairing each community member with a volunteer who will coordinate the grocery delivery. Volunteers are typically tasked solely with the pickup and delivery of groceries that have been paid for in advance by the person ordering the service, according to Alec Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy and law major and the founder of Manos de Mapaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the program, still in its infancy, has remained flexible in order to adapt to different needs, according to Valdez. Volunteers are encouraged to coordinate with the person in need of service to find the most accessible system for ordering groceries, depending on the circumstances. Anyone under the age of 40 who is in good health and meets other criteria including practicing social distancing  can volunteer with Manos de Mapaches, according to its </span><a href=\"https://manosdemapaches.wixsite.com/sbhands/volunteer-with-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is also developing a project called “Community Connections,” a social exchange program in which volunteers are digitally connected to people from high-risk demographics — such as the elderly —  to relieve the loneliness that has accompanied the shelter-in-place orders, according to Valdez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manos de Mapaches is an effort that stemmed from the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) at UCSB, according to Valdez, who is also the co-coordinator of C.A.B. Alternative Breaks. Because Alternative Breaks’ planned volunteer operations for the quarter had been canceled, Valdez said he created Manos de Mapaches to help serve others in this new reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for Manos de Mapaches was inspired by a group of volunteers in New York called Invisible Hands, Valdez said. Like Manos de Mapaches, Invisible Hands also provides grocery shopping and deliveries for those who are most at risk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar light, the A.S. Food Bank has teamed up with the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County and recently shifted its services to the distribution of brown bags, containing items such as pasta, beans and sauces, according to its Facebook </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbasfoodbank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Food Bank now distributes these groceries outside the front of its location at the University Center on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The A.S. Food Bank is also giving out meal tickets through an online </span><a href=\"https://foodbank.as.ucsb.edu/swipes-for-us-application/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process, which can be used for pick-up meals at the Portola Dining Commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has put a strain on the community, Cohen maintains that the importance of food — now more than ever — is integral in keeping spirits high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“More than food, these meals foster a moment of connection and seeing and being seen, and a reminder that everyone matters,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta City Council chose the unorthodox suite of library resources from four options proposed by staff from the Goleta Valley Library, which were based on an outreach project funded by </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a nonprofit organization which aims to develop relationships and social progress in communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outreach project has been the driving force in helping library staff determine what the community wants to see in a library for I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Harwood Institute] trained us in holding conversations with people to assess what their aspirations were for library services from Goleta Library,” Goleta Valley Library Director Allison Gray said at the meeting. “Altogether, we had 14 outreaches and we spoke with about 720 people — over 600 of whom were from the Isla Vista area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the hybrid option, the library also proposed a bookmobile, a fully serviced branch and a reading room as options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chosen option for a hybrid-style library includes multiple pop-up services, such as book vending machines, book drops, pop-up libraries — where people can download e-books — and a cargo van, which will bring books into I.V. and deliver them to people who have placed books on hold. The van, which is planned to operate for 40 hours each week, could also hold programming and host events either outside or at available spaces throughout I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a great option because it’s actually offering personal library service. It’s like catered library service [for] people so they’d be getting the best individual service of anyone in our community,” Gray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another benefit of the hybrid option is its affordability, according to Gray. Assemblymember Monique Limón, who represents the 37th district that includes parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, secured $200,000 for library services in I.V. through state funding, which would more than cover the $154,196 needed for the hybrid option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) offered space for a Reading Room — a quiet space to read or study —  through the I.V. Community Room and the I.V. Community Center, in addition to the hybrid library option in a letter sent to the Goleta City Council on April 6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the timeline to implement the program has stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said he’s hopeful that the program will be ready to kick off when California’s stay-at-home order is lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a huge step forward. Isla Vista has never had its own library, however, we pay $200,000 worth of taxes for a local library every year,” Brandt said.“I’m really glad that we are set to have a physical location.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
