These two guards make plays and take shots, pushing along the speed of play.</p>\n<p>Childress played hard all 34 minutes that he was on the court, coming away with four defensive rebounds as well as four assists. Despite Santa Barbara accounting for 18 total turnovers in their opener, Childress was a bright spot only turning the ball over twice.</p>\n<p>An up-and-coming power player for the Gauchos is redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju. Having only made it into 15 games last season, he scored 12 points in his 16 minutes of playing time on Saturday. In addition to an offensive rebound, he managed to grab five defensive boards as well.</p>\n<p>Lakoju first gave the UCSB fans a glimpse of his abilities in an exhibition game against Fresno Pacific where he made three baskets in under one minute. His speed and power this year has been balanced nicely by counterpart junior transfer forward Jalen Canty, who shot 2-4 with five points against the Mavericks.</p>\n<p>His speed and power this year has been balanced nicely by counterpart junior transfer forward Jalen Canty, who shot 2-4 with five points against the Mavericks. In their exhibiton, Canty went off for 17 points, a performance the Gauchos hope they can get in this match-up.</p>\n<p>Canty, a distinguished player from the City College of San Francisco, has maintained his position as a starter and managed to rebound four balls, block two and grab five points in his 22 minutes against the Mavs. His size and energy on the court have already made a difference for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite losing key players Devin Watson and Tim Derksen — two Dons that played really well against UCSB — USF is coming in hot after having closely won their first game against Illinois-Chicago 82-80.</p>\n<p>One returning player, sophomore guard Mladen Djordjevic, scored eight against the Gauchos last year. Having worked his way to a starting position this season, the former Serbian U-20 Men’s National Team player scored nine against the Flames along with four assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Two returning starters, forwards Nate Renfro and Chase Foster, stand to step up into bigger leadership roles this year. Last season they only scored a combined three points against the Gauchos. Now that their top dogs are gone, it is their chance to show the team just what kind of players they are.</p>\n<p>As a freshman last year, Renfro shot 51.2 percent and had 19 blocks on the year, proving his capability as a starter. Against Illinois-Chicago, he scored 12 points over 27 minutes along with three assists.</p>\n<p>Foster came away with eight points, shooting 4-9 against the Flames. During the 2015-16 season, the Colorado native made 27 three-pointers and played in all 30 games.</p>\n<p>Senior Ronnie Boyce shone brightly as a leader against the Illinois-Chicago, scoring 28 points in 26 minutes of playing time, 13 points more than any other player on the court. Boyce, a guard originally from Oklahoma, will definitely be a player to watch.</p>\n<p>Transferring to USF as a junior in 2015, he earned his position as third-leading scorer on the team, including a career-high 25 point performance away with a career high of 25 points, a personal record he has already beat in just the first game of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>In last year’s UCSB-USF game, Boyce played only two minutes. Judging by his performance last week, the Gauchos will most likely be seeing plenty of him.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced-off, UCSB may have won, but the Dons fought it to the end, scoring six points in the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>Having just lost at home, the Gauchos will be looking to turn around that 0-1 record at the Thunderdome on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

I thought he was good, especially second half, very aggressive, trying to score, he rebounded well both halves,” Head Coach Bob Williams said.</p>\n<p>The California native led all scorers with 17 points and ran all over the court grabbing seven boards and registering two blocks.</p>\n<p>The home team started a bit slow but managed to take an 8-5 lead into the first official timeout. After a made three-pointer by FPU’s junior point guard Jordan Belasco that tied the game, the Gauchos scored seven unanswered and saw most of its starting five head to the bench.</p>\n<p>After two made baskets by the Sunbirds, sophomore forward Ami Lakoju scored six points in a row over the course of 52 seconds to extend the UCSB lead to nine at 21-12.</p>\n<p>Last year, Lakoju scored a career-high four points at Cal, a statistic he crushed today scoring six baskets for a total of 12 points while snagging four boards.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first half, the Gauchos took an impressive 36-22 lead. Three of Santa Barbara’s newest additions, Canty, and freshman guards Christian Terrell and Clifton Powell Jr. combined for 11 points.</p>\n<p>Without any single player emerging as a beast for Fresno Pacific in the first half, the Sunbirds worked together to earn their 22 points with three-pointers scored by senior point guard T.J. Viney, Belasco and junior guard Sam Holmes.</p>\n<p>As the second half began, it was clear that the home team was starting to pull away. The Gauchos started the second half strong with back-to-back layups from Canty.</p>\n<p>Later in the final frame, UCSB successfully made three long balls in a row, one from junior guard Gabe Vincent and two from senior point guard Eric Childress, to take a 51-29 lead.</p>\n<p>After that, at the 8:29 mark, freshman guard Terrell made a fantastic steal, quickly passing down the court to a wide-open Childress.</p>\n<p>The senior caught the pass mid-stride, scoring effortlessly, raising Gaucho supporters to their feet as the home team took a game high 26-point lead at 69-43.</p>\n<p>Having only scored over 80 points on five occasions last season, the Gauchos finished the game with a whopping 82 while holding their opponents to 62. Fifty of those points were earned by four players — Canty, Childress, Vincent, and Lakoju — with each scoring in the double-digits.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall loss, Kavika Jimenez led FPU with 13 points, six rebounds, and three assists.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara saw many good things from its young team, but primarily from the big three that will be leading the team this year: Childress, Vincent, and Canty.</p>\n<p>Childress played great finishing with 10 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Vincent, on the other hand, was only 3-10 from the field but all three shots made were from long distance, plus two free throws from the line saw him scoring 11 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“I was pleased with the leadership from Eric [Childress] and Gabe [Vincent],” Williams said. “They played well but more importantly were so poised and had good leadership with the young kids as they got rattled.”</p>\n<p>There are a number of seasoned players on this team, but the Gauchos gained new talent this year and though they appeared to be comfortable and fluid on the court, there is room for improvement as the season progresses.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball season will officially start with a non-conference game against Nebraska-Omaha on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 2:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73940\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73940\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/gauchos-dominate-sunbirds-in-home-exhibition/","id":307,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[306,305,304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Open Season on the Road, Face Iowa St. Cyclones","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-6-16_4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Bonnie Henrickson era is ready to begin its second season as UCSB faces Iowa St. on the road for its season opener.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>College basketball will officially make its return this week as men’s and women’s programs across the nation begin their seasons.</p>\n<p>As for the UCSB women’s basketball team, it will play its season opener on the road at Iowa State this Friday.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In 2015-16, Iowa St. ranked second in the Big 12 in total three-point field goals made, knocking down 208 to go along with its average of 6.93 three-point makes per game. Nothing restricted the program’s willingness to shoot the deep ball throughout the season as they ended with a total of 678 three-pointers attempted.</p>\n<p>Despite making 208 shots from beyond the arc, the Cyclones three-point percentage remained low at 30.7 percent, ranking ninth in their conference.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key to defeating Iowa State is to disrupt the Cyclones from beyond the arc. Inevitably, that is the goal for the Gauchos, who allowed an opponent three-point percentage of 30.9 last season.</p>\n<p>“Iowa State is a program, historically, that shoots a lot of threes,” UCSB Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “The thing is, we’ve got to limit the number of threes they get. We’re not trying to get in a ‘who can make more threes contest,’ because that’s not going to be in our advantage.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos don’t stand much of a chance if they try to outgun the Cyclones, but it’s a very different story if they manage to force Iowa State inside.</p>\n<p>Doing so not only evens the playing field between the two sides, but it would also go a long way toward keeping what’s sure to be a massive crowd quiet.</p>\n<p>“The best way to keep [the crowd] quiet is to not let [Iowa State] hit a bunch of threes,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s many perimeter players will be instrumental in carrying out Henrickson’s defensive strategy. In practice, Henrickson placed a heavy emphasis on perimeter rotations, shifting from one player to another in an attempt to deny the Cyclones any open threes.</p>\n<p>For what it’s worth, the Gauchos were very successful at keeping Cal State L.A. quiet from three-point range in their exhibition game on Sunday, holding the Golden Eagles to 25 percent from long range on 5-20 three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>However, doing the same against a program like Iowa State — projected to finish fourth in the Big 12 — will be a much more challenging task.</p>\n<p>While the Cyclones’ first look on offense is to the outside, the Gauchos plan to look inside when they have the ball. The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, playing her first year for the Gauchos after transferring from USC, has given UCSB a veritable post presence.</p>\n<p>“We’re always going to go inside,” Henrickson said. “If we’ve got a good post player, we’re always going to go inside.</p>\n<p>You have to, because if you’re not good right there it’s just too easy to guard everything else.”</p>\n<p>Edelman demonstrated the strength of that offensive ideology on Sunday, posting 10 points and 10 rebounds in 20 minutes of play. Standing at 6’4”, the center enjoys her role as the focal point of the offense.</p>\n<p>“It definitely feels good [to be the first look],” Edelman said. “I can help get some easy buckets, especially early in the game because they’ll collapse and at that point I can look out to the three.”</p>\n<p>Standing out at the three-point line will be an array of solid shooters, a new strength for the Gauchos. Junior guard Makala Roper and sophomore guard Coco Miller played that part admirably last year. Roper led the team with 63 made three-pointers and Miller followed with 53. Ole Miss transfer sophomore guard Sarah Porter is another component within the Gauchos’ array of shooters.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s perimeter depth extends to the point guard position as well, where veteran senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe is joined by Drea Toler, a redshirt junior point guard who transferred from the University of Oregon.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, both Jemerigbe and Toler displayed an affinity for the drive-and-kick, finishing with six and seven assists, respectively.</p>\n<p>Roper, Miller and Porter were the overwhelming beneficiaries of those drives, receiving open looks from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>It’s unlikely that Toler and Jemerigbe will be able to have such success against the Cyclones, but the inside-out game could still pay dividends.

They have one girl who’s taken 19 threes in two games and they’ve taken only eight free throws, which is really indicative of a lot of catch-and-shoot from three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of Seattle’s offensive production, including its production from three-point land, comes from just two players: senior wing Kaylee Best and senior wing Alexis Montgomery. Best, a 5’8” senior wing, is shooting over 47 percent from long range and is averaging a Western Athletic Conference-high 21.5 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just need to limit (Best’s) touches,” Hendrickson said. “We need to execute ball-side deny, we need to know their personnel and where she is on the floor, and we need to keep our hands up on defense. The main thing is just going to be keeping the ball out of her hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow Montgomery has started off on fire, shooting 50 percent from three and scoring 14.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopping Best and Montgomery, or at least keeping them relatively quiet, is UCSB’s best chance at forcing the Redhawk offense to a halt. Only one other Seattle player — senior guard Claire Metoyer — is averaging over five points per game. If the Gauchos can get the ball out of Best or Montgomery’s hands, they’ll have succeeded in getting the Redhawks out of their offensive comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their two regular-season games, plus their exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, the Gauchos have shown a definite affinity for the three, but Hendrickson isn’t planning on making that a focus on Friday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our advantage is inside, so we’ll focus on getting high percentage touches there,” Hendrickson said. “If we can do that consistently, the defense will collapse and we can kick it outside. If we can score a number of different ways it really puts pressure on the defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Redshirt junior Drew Edelman will be the key to success of Hendrickson’s game plan. The 6’4” center put up 16 points, all in the second half, to push the Gauchos past Pepperdine on Tuesday and will be the player point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and junior Drea Toler will look to funnel the ball down low to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Hendrickson’s vision come true, and the Gauchos succeed in forcing the Redhawk defense to collapse, there will be several beneficiaries among the UCSB offense. Sophomore wing Coco Miller went off for 24 points, including five threes, against Pepperdine, and, along with guards junior Makala Roper and sophomore Sarah Porter, will be eager for kick-outs from Edelman and the other Gaucho bigs.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Seattle University at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 18 at KeyArena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74355\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74355\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/gauchos-travel-to-seattle-in-search-of-a-second-straight-win/","id":309,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[308,307,306],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
