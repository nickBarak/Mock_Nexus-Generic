Yes, it’s very reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, except that it’s not entirely. James proclaims himself as a sociopath within the first 40 seconds of the show, taking pleasure in killing small animals and self-inflicting pain (showing off an entire burnt hand to prove it). He later explains that he engages in these behaviors in order to make himself feel something after witnessing his mother’s suicide. Except now, he’s ready to move on to bigger targets. This is where Alyssa comes in, a brazen girl with a strong IDGAF attitude battling her own issues at home.</p>\n<p>The pilot wastes no time in jumping to the “boy meets girl” trope and executes it in a brilliantly humorous and blunt way; it may be one of my favorite introductions in television history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen you skating,” Alyssa says to James in the school cafeteria. “You’re pretty shit.”</p>\n<p>James response?</p>\n<p>“Fuck off.”</p>\n<p>As the pilot progresses, we discover that while James is fantasizing about Alyssa becoming his first human murder, she begins to grow comfortable with him, even saying he’s someone she could fall in love with. If that’s not depressing, then I don’t know what is. Evidently enough, Alyssa easily sways James into ditching town with her and he goes along for the ride, as he finds it the perfect opportunity to murder her. By the end of the episode, the two hop in James’s dad’s car and embark on a road trip that promptly becomes more of an impulsive crime spree (the “armed” robbery is hands down one of my favorite scenes) as they search for Alyssa’s father.</p>\n<p>The show moves back and forth between perspectives, providing deeper insight in getting to know our antiheroine and antihero. Through the characters’ inner monologues, done wonderfully through voiceovers, we gain a deeper understanding of their personalities. James’s thoughts convey a monotone indifference to match his perpetually disturbed yet aloof façade; Alyssa, on the hand, is quite multifaceted.</p>\n<p>Despite her aggressively upfront, careless approach (throwing curses shamelessly at the world, rolling her eyes at anything and everything), thoughts expose her as vulnerable and wounded. It’s comical as viewers to watch how vastly different these two characters are; Alyssa is all nihilistic spunk and spontaneity while James is merely a bystander to all her wayward antics.</p>\n<p>At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore. They’re brimming with a bleak resentment to an awful society, taking out their frustrations and fragilities in a manner that’s both droll and gloomy.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this story so oddly beautiful is the human connection that is made between two people who seem so, well, inhuman. It’s when Alyssa somehow finds her way back to James and when James somehow can’t bring himself to leave Alyssa in spite of her mad father — it’s these moments that display how much they’ve come to care for each other. The sinister events that follow their escape and mutual feeling of adolescent confusion tie them together, a bond that can’t be broken. No matter how deranged the story is, it’s a story of love.</p>\n<p>Overall, “The End of the F***ing World” provides all the essentials for an indie teen flick: a road trip, a banging soundtrack, running from the authorities, two underdogs we <em>really shouldn’t be rooting for</em>, but do anyway … and an honorary mention to the wardrobe change mid-season (a Hawaiian shirt makes for a perfect disguise, right?).</p>\n<p>However, all this would not be so easy to binge in an entire day if it weren’t for the compelling acting of the two leads. Barden pins the tail right on the donkey with her character; while playing a bratty teenage girl with issues sounds derivative and cliché, it’s done with a complexity one simply can’t help but love. I fear her, but I also just want to be her mom friend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lawther’s performance is phenomenal, capturing all the subtle intricacies that make James so disconcerting and intriguing to watch (I expected nothing less after seeing him on “Black Mirror”). As each episode briskly passes by, it becomes hard to not fall for the charms of the duo.</p>\n<p>Writer Charlie Covell and director Jonathan Entwistle remarkably capture the genuine connection that evolves between Alyssa and James. It’s a fast-paced story, jumping from one mishap to another, with side narratives that thankfully do not detract from the main plot — everything is well interwoven until the very end of the series. Right when you become engrossed into this explicitly dark, dark world, it all comes to an end, and eight episodes suddenly feels far too short.</p>\n<p>It’s unlike any show I’ve seen on television; it’s the perfect storm of teenage rebellion to a heightened ending. Despite the ambiguous finale that leaves the viewer in a stupor, desperately itching for more, it’s hard to envision continuing this world after the helter-skelter chaos of one season. Bravo Alyssa and James, for making a love story truly feel like the end of the fucking world.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/","id":5809,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[5808,5807,5806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul","biography":"Not available","articles":[5809,6611,6739,6791,6819,6955],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"‘Loving Vincent’ Captures Van Gogh in Motion","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":" Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Loving Vincent,” by directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, functions oddly as a work of art. It is by no means a bad film; in fact, by many measures, it is a masterpiece. Inspired by the life and work of Vincent van Gogh, “Loving Vincent” is the first fully painted feature film. Every single frame in the movie is the work of a team of artists; each minute is comprised of the efforts of hundreds of people working for hundreds of hours. Their work and talent is manifested in the film, which is never anything less than visually stunning. That is the ‘how’ of the movie, and it is beyond reproach. As a work of visual art, “Loving Vincent” deserves to be seen by everyone with even a passing interest in Vincent van Gogh.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, “Loving Vincent” is not a painting. It is a movie, and as a movie, it is rarely more than, well, fine. The movie is never atrociously bad. “Loving Vincent” follows Armand, the son of Vincent van Gogh’s postman, as he attempts to deliver Van Gogh’s last letter, a year after van Gogh’s death.  In the process of finding the rightful owner of the letter, Armand learns more about the man and is drawn into the mystery of van Gogh’s apparent suicide. What follows is a meandering and low-stakes murder mystery that feels utterly inconsequential — even in the basic description of the movie’s plot, it begins to feel like a little bit of a stretch. The protagonist has too little to do with the subject. The story is not enticing, and it has little narrative drive. Great effort is made to incorporate the subjects of van Gogh’s actual paintings into the narrative. The thought of that is nice, but it only slows the plot even further. In this movie, every frame is a memorial of the great artist, and every time it is to the expense of the elements of a film that typically differentiate film from the other visual mediums.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"190192479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79341\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79342\" data-attachment-id=\"79342\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/vg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vg…\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79342\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vg....jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The movie is about a murder mystery a year removed from all of the action, which is already centuries removed from us. It begs the question: “Why am I watching this? This is not interesting.” Van Gogh is only present in the occasional black and white flashback, so for a movie dedicated as a monument to the painter, we see frustratingly little of him. We mostly hear about him, through the mouths of all the characters he knew and painted. Thus the movie finds itself making the critical mistake of showing nearly nothing and telling almost everything. The mistake is especially confounding when the basic premise of the movie is its visual potency. It is a gorgeous film, but it is mostly a film of talking heads. What I would give for a more kinetic film in this style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The performances in the film are fine. They’re an odd mix of live action and animation, as actors performed the scenes on soundstages for the animators to paint over. The actors fill their painted world with little charms, but can do little to elevate their material to any sense of urgency or importance. It’s hard for the actors to get over the fact that all of their lines are biographical exposition.</p>\n<p>I’m left with an odd feeling after watching the film. There are many things that stuck out to me as mistakes. There are many things about it that I will gleefully criticize because, in many ways, it is a bad movie.</p>\n<p>But I loved it.</p>\n<p>In spite of all of its flaws as a film, it was an entrancing experience. The amount of love that went into it over a period of years is palpable. The love can be felt in the soft, ever-so-slightly changing brush strokes and in the credits as I watched the names of hundreds of artists fly by. The movie is, warts and all, an impressive testament to the lasting powers of art and the impression it has made on so many people through so many years. From van Gogh to the directors, the directors to their team of tireless painters and the painters to us.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, there is a scene where two drunks get into a fight. It’s a relatively complicated shot, with the camera weaving between the two figures. Here is when the illusion of the film is at its strongest, where the two art forms meet. As it stands, “Loving Vincent” is only a masterpiece of painting and a mediocre film. The movie shies away from motion most of the time, leaving it static like a painting. If it committed to its hybrid nature more often and strived to be a movie worth engaging with as well as art worth watching, it would be truly sublime.</p>\n<p>As it is, it is only beautiful.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/loving-vincent-captures-van-gogh-in-motion/","id":5806,"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen"},"related":[5805,5804,5803],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beloved Cartoon ‘Samurai Jack’ Comes and Goes","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samurai_Jack.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The show made its long-awaited return in March.

Although it had been 14 years for us, for Jack himself, it had been 50. During that time, the wandering samurai went through several traumatic events that left him without his sword, his optimism and his humanity. This change of tone allowed creator Genndy Tartakovsky to forego the original show’s episodic format in favor of a serialized journey.</p>\n<p>As a result, we got an emotionally harrowing tale of a worn-down Jack, who has by now gone full Mad Max, riding a motorcycle and shooting guns. He fights his suicidal guilt over not only failing to return to the past to save his family, but also failing to save those who have fallen victim to the rule of Aku (now voiced by Greg Baldwin). Meanwhile, Jack must confront and face newcomer Ashi (Tara Strong, a.k.a. Timmy Turner), a woman with a traumatic past who is more than capable of kicking Jack’s ass. Together, they endure many misadventures that allow us to ease back into the wonderfully weird world of our favorite time-displaced samurai.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notably, the switch from plain old Cartoon Network to the Adult Swim time slot allowed the show to be grittier, bloodier, more emotionally wrenching and gave us the line, “Woah, what a freak. Looked like a talking penis,” from Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob Squarepants).</p>\n<p>This change in tone is welcome, as everyone who watched “Jack” as a child (myself included) have all grown up. While I wouldn’t say we were hungry for guts and gore (which this season has used sparingly), we certainly came to expect something more engrossing that would justify the series’s 13-year absence. We got it.</p>\n<p>Holy shit did we. But the show’s return is also indicative of a current trend in the television landscape: the appeal to nostalgia.</p>\n<p>No-brainer, right? If it was popular once, why not bring it back (cough someone renew “Firefly” dammit cough)?  We’re seeing the likes of “Twin Peaks,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Voltron,” “24,” “Arrested Development,” “Ben 10,” “Dragon Ball Super,” “Young Justice,” et cetera, et cetera, coming back from the grave (or at least from the line at the morgue). All of these shows are either revivals or sequels of a once-popular franchise that has been kept alive via an intravenous stream of fan demand. The market for nostalgia is exploding.</p>\n<p>You can see this pretty clear within season five of “Jack” itself.  Although technology has marched on (everything is animated digitally), the show’s visual style has stayed almost exactly the same, despite Taratovsky having experimented with other styles and formats. There’s an episode where Ashi runs into a whole plethora of characters from the original run of “Samurai Jack.” The re-animated flashback scenes are staged almost exactly like the original versions, setting up the viewer for an emotional reminiscence before eventually getting back to the action at hand.</p>\n<p>Basically, TV shows have discovered that the best way to rein us in is tossing a barbed lasso around our hearts and memories. As cheesy and stupid a metaphor as that sounds (you can see why I am not a poet), it sure as hell works. The last two “Star Wars” movies made more than a billion dollars at the box office. So did “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s even a “live-action” “The Lion King” coming up and I will bet my firstborn — whenever they come into existence — that it will make just as much money as the aforementioned films.</p>\n<p>Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. We get to see the stories of stuff we love re-imagined and the people who took the effort of others and gave it a new coat of paint get a shitload of money … hm.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s look at it another way. These continuations of our childhoods allow us, I believe, to stop and reflect for a moment on how we’ve grown. We can see how culture has aged with us; we get to reflect on why we fell in love with these shows in the first place. Or maybe we’re just children in the bodies of college students. If so, I’d like to propose a resolution to A.S. that we place a giant ball pit in front of Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, where was I? Ah, right. This Saturday, “Samurai Jack” will end. How? Who knows? But after so many years, many of us will gain closure. We will get to see a journey we’ve been watching since 2001 finally come to an end, along with a chapter of our childhoods. There better be gallons of blood all over the screen.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung clearly has no idea what the hell he is talking about and it’s a wonder we haven’t fired him yet.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/","id":5807,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5806,5805,5804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Pride: Standing Strong in the Face of Adversity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Ali Gerrard explains why Isla Vista is still our beautiful home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I have desperately tried to avoid social media and the media in general over the past few days. Sad, confused and angry, I have found the opinions and views of those living outside of the Isla Vista community critical and unproductive. Facebook posts speculating why such a tragedy “was bound to occur” because Isla Vista is “only a place for partying” are sickening and unnecessary (#unfriend).</p>\n<p>This is our home. Our unique, diverse, twisted home, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. To watch it be ridiculed and critiqued while we are all in a place of mourning makes this incident all the more difficult.</p>\n<p>This is why I would like to remind my fellow Gauchos to hold your heads high. We are strong and resilient and we should not be defined by the tragedies that have occurred, but instead by our strength and power to pull together in a time of grieving.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I am reminded, even after such monumental devastation, that I.V. is a beautiful place of diversity and can never be narrowly described as “a place to party.” This is where we have met lifelong friends and had irreplaceable memories.</p>\n<p>I will choose to see this as my home, and not let one man’s malicious intentions, a newscast team’s cameras or a Facebook friend’s ridiculous post define Isla Vista for me.
