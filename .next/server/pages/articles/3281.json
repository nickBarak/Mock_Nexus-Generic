While it was strictly business for some athletes in a tight race for first, none could hold back the smiles after taking that final pedestal bow in front of thousands of fans.</p>\n<p>A tradition that started in 1968, the Special Olympics has been a tool for hope and inspired many all over who suffer from special needs. This iconic ceremony let the world know that being a great athlete isn’t decided by one’s physical appearance or abilities, but rather by strength within.</p>\n<p>Take Scott Rohrer as a prime example. An individual that suffers from autism, Rohrer did not let his medical condition be a setback.</p>\n<p>The Special Olympics Team USA golfer earned himself a new record on Sunday posting a career low 276, or 12 under par. The golfer’s success has been a common occurrence during the Special Olympics winning three gold medals in 2007, 2009, and 2011.</p>\n<p>Rohrer told ESPN that in all of his golf moments, winning Special Olympics gold ranks “at the top.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never felt anything like this before and it’s a true honor,” he said.</p>\n<p>The four-time champ was not the only athlete that made his mark on Sunday. After 38 battles with liver malfunctions, kidney defects, and strokes, the 5-foot, 2-inch Chevi Peters proved doubters wrong putting on that Team USA uniform.</p>\n<p>With a little lift from his trainer John Lair, Peters accomplished one of his biggest dreams on Sunday – taking first place in the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>The Kansas native qualified for the combination event, a series of three lifts starting with squats, bench-press, and deadlifts. After pressing a combined 408 pounds in the squat and bench only one more lift stood in the way of Peter’s gold medal.</p>\n<p>Deadlifting a total of 325 pounds and finishing the event with a total of 733 pounds, the “Manimal” lived up to his nickname and embraced his coach in an emotional victory.</p>\n<p>“If you put your mind to it with hard work and dedication anything is possible,” Peters said in an interview with ESPN.</p>\n<p>The lifter went home to Parsons, Kansas with 4 medals in total, one silver and three gold.</p>\n<p>His will to never give up is a testament to younger ones everywhere. Peters proved that dreams can come true and that you can inspire those around you. These are the true ingredients to being a hero.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/","id":3281,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3280,3279,3278],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Universities Get Schooled by Rising Dropout Rates","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In response to the rising high dropout rate plaguing many California high schools, the California Dropout Research Project, founded at UCSB's Gevirtz Graduate School in December 2006, will investigate...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In response to the rising high dropout rate plaguing many California high schools, the California Dropout Research Project, founded at UCSB’s Gevirtz Graduate School in December 2006, will investigate the “dropout crisis” in California.

Gordon said one of the fundamental problems in evaluating the dropout problem is the lack of conclusive data and inconsistency of the results.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the biggest problems is that we don’t have a system for tracking students,” Gordon said. “We really don’t know the graduation rate. All we have is estimates. They’ve been working on it for years and years and years.”</p>\n<p>Professor Russell W. Rumberger, a prominent high school dropout researcher and CDRP director, said educators are interested in early indicators signaling potential dropouts. He said middle schools and junior high schools usually fail to report poor academic performance of students to high schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>“One of the best predictors [of dropouts] is if they’re failing in middle school,” Rumberger said. “We could do a better job preventing dropouts by looking at kids early on and seeing if we can do something about it before they get to high school.”</p>\n<p>Gordon said that students require more guidance through their educational years.</p>\n<p>“Good programs are ones that provide support,” he said. “It could be a teacher or it could be a counselor. Kids need connections with caring adults.”</p>\n<p>One program, UCSB’s Upward Bound, aims to encourage middle school and high school students in Santa Barbara County to attend college. It also provides services to UCSB students coming from disadvantaged families. On May 15, Congresswoman Lois Capps promised $400,000 in federal aid to support the program, which is currently stationed in a small trailer near South Hall.</p>\n<p><b>Encouraging Diversity</b></p>\n<p>In spite of these attempts to alleviate the situation, some professors have resorted to creating their own intervention programs to resolve the dropout crisis, which many feel has a direct effect on campus diversity. In response to the lack of minorities on campus, College of Creative Studies professor Caroline Allen launched a program to get local kids involved in summer art classes on campus.</p>\n<p>Allen said the CCS Summer Arts Institute offers writing, painting and photography classes to local students who may be the first in their family to attend college.</p>\n<p>In addition, Allen said the No Child Left Behind Act has had a detrimental effect on high school arts programs, as teachers are given less discretion as to the curriculum they choose to teach, and some instructors elect to only teach the material presented on standardized tests, which affects the amount of funding each school receives.</p>\n<p>“They have the five-paragraph essay shoved down their throats,” Allen said. “[Here, they] learn to have fun with their writing and be more expressive.”</p>\n<p>Alli Miarkiani, a former student of the summer institute, said the freedom of the CCS course pushed him to improve his own writing.  He said instructors used unique methods to motivate students.</p>\n<p>“They said, ‘here is a famous piece of writing, see if you can use this as an inspiration for your own writing,'” Miarkiani said. “My writing improved dramatically. It was amazing.”</p>\n<p>Allen said she hopes this program will encourage her mostly Latino students to consider college, especially UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said courses such as Allen’s a step in the right direction in trying to attract more minority students to UCSB. According to the CDRP website, Latinos are twice as likely as whites to drop out of school. Rumberger said schools must begin to cater toward the needs of Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Developing English language proficiency is critical to their success,” he said. “I don’t think there is a single best model, but clearly we need to do a better job at educating our Latino students.”</p>\n<p>Allen said universities and high schools need to inspire students to continue their education.</p>\n<p>“Bringing students on campus is an important step,” Allen said. “They need to know that good things happen here and they can be a part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, some instructors say other factors may explain why minorities do not come to UCSB. According to Black studies professor Dr. Gaye Theresa Johnson, UCSB is not considered a friendly environment for black students. Johnson also said that although more minorities are being accepted into UCSB, fewer students are enrolling, in part due to recent fee hikes.</p>\n<p>“The reason that they’re not coming is because fees are going up,” Johnson said. “[It’s] not just fee increases, but cutbacks in financial aid and increases in loans, but not in grants… Fee increases are an example of higher education becoming more elitist.”</p>\n<p>Just last week, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed a 7-10 percent increase in fees for the UC campuses as part of his 2007-08 California State Budget revisions.</p>\n<p>Johnson said the rise in previous black student acceptance rates is misleading.</p>\n<p>“Even though more black students are eligible for college, black economic disparity compared to white privilege makes black communities more embattled,” Johnson said. “It looks like [black students] have more access, but disparity in wealth is greater than it has ever been.”</p>\n<p><b>Socioeconomic Impact</b></p>\n<p>In addition to pinpointing the real dropout rate, CDRP aims to examine the economic and social costs that high school students who fail to obtain a diploma impose upon society. The new studies being produced will highlight common characteristics of potential dropouts and predict high school graduation statistics.</p>\n<p>Currently, the effects of dropping out have been shown to affect earnings, crime rates and even life expectancy, according to one study. In Fall 2005, Teachers College, Columbia University found the following: A high school dropouts earn about $260,000 less over their lifetime than their counterparts who earn diplomas. High school dropouts also live 9.2 years less on average than people who graduated high school. In addition, increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for all men ages 20-60 would save the U.S. up to $1.4 billion per year in reduced costs from crime.</p>\n<p>According to the California Dropout Research Project website, dropouts are incredibly costly to California, and are more likely to seek welfare support, commit crimes and become incarcerated. In fact, more than 80 percent of California’s prisoners, in 2005, did not graduate from high school, costing California taxpayers $35,000 for each inmate per year. The CDRP also asserts that dropouts suffer from poor health and are more likely to require public health support.</p>\n<p>The Public Policy Institute of California deemed that with the ongoing trends, twice as many high school students may drop out by the year 2025.</p>\n<p><b>Outreach and Preparation Programs</b></p>\n<p>In regards to programs that attempt to ensure graduation and further education, Gordon ok said Advancement Via Individual Determination, an in-school academic support program for grades 4-12 that prepares students for college, is extremely effective.</p>\n<p>“[A.V.I.D. is] a teaching plus a counseling program,” Gordon said. “Their success rate is phenomenal. The figure is 84 percent who get admitted into college and 100 percent who graduate the High School Exit Exam.”</p>\n<p>While Gordon said college outreach programs are often misdirected. He said the programs advertised the benefits of a college education instead of assisting parents and student throughout the application process.</p>\n<p>“I think the outreach stuff is misplaced,” he said. “We do not need to convince [students] that it’s important go to college. Until you help families navigate the bureaucracy, they don’t have a chance. Filling out forms is completely foreign to them. The families had no more idea about how to get a college application or financial aid than to be an astronaut.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s own Student Initiated Outreach Program, which prepares K-12 students to succeed in college, strives to increase underrepresented student populations on college campuses by encouraging a “college-going atmosphere.” Among other programs, their services include group visits to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Third-year Asian American studies major and current SIOP chair Tuyen Nguyen said the committee gives funding to student groups who work with high schools to encourage student success.</p>\n<p>“[The student groups] describe a project proposal and the student organization,” Nguyen said. “They bring hundreds and hundreds of students on a outreach day to give the students an idea that education in college is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Over 15 student organizations are represented on campus including Hermanos Unidos, Black Student Union and El Congreso. They bring students on campus to attend cultural and historical workshops as well as to classes that discuss the required curriculum they will need to complete in order to secure admission.</p>\n<p><b>Barriers</b></p>\n<p>However, some high schools don’t even offer the classes UC schools require.</p>\n<p>Sheilagh Polk, media relations manager for Community Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works to help south L.A. residents, said the Fighting for the Future program is working to ensure local schools provide the necessary classes.</p>\n<p>“A number of students weren’t eligible to attend a Cal State or a UC university because they were missing a math or science requirement,” Polk said. “It wasn’t because students didn’t want to take these classes, but they weren’t offered.”</p>\n<p>One such school is L.A.’s John C. Fremont Senior High. In addition to missing requirements, Polk said its students score significantly lower on their S.A.T.s.</p>\n<p>At Fremont, between 2004 and 2005, the average score was 352 for Verbal and 368 for Math, totaling 720 out of a possible 1600. That puts its participants in the bottom 10 percent of all test takers.</p>\n<p>The newest version of the S.A.T., implemented in 2006, now includes a writing portion on the exam worth 800 points, which brings the perfect score total to 2400 as opposed to the previous 1600.</p>\n<p>According to Collegeboard.com, the 2006 mean S.A.T. scores for college-bound seniors were 503 for Critical Reading, 518 for Math and 497 for Writing totaling 1518 out of a possible 2400.</p>\n<p>The averages for UCSB’s incoming class of 2007 are 616 for Critical Reading, 636 for Math, and 614 for Writing, totaling 1866.</p>\n<p><b>Exit Exams</b></p>\n<p>Being eligible to attend college is one issue; being eligible to graduate from high school is another. 2007 marks the second year that the state will require students to obtain a passing grade on the California High School Exit Exam in order to graduate.</p>\n<p>Polk said students should graduate from high school if they pass their classes.</p>\n<p>“I am against the CAHSEE exam because I feel it is unfair to punish them for 12 years of inadequate education,” Polk said. “They can’t pass a test they weren’t prepared for.”</p>\n<p>However, Gordon said most of the students who do not pass also lack the required credits, and would not have graduated anyway. He said in Sacramento, only 3 to 4 percent of students were denied a diploma solely because they did not pass the CAHSEE.</p>\n<p>Rumberger said that while the intentions behind the CAHSEE are good, poor implementation hinders the program’s success. Instead, he suggested the state offer differentiated diplomas – degrees based on varying high school and testing performance, so that all students who take required classes and pass would receive a degree. He said schools could then identify exceptional students by issuing higher-ranking diplomas.</p>\n<p>“I think the idea [of the CAHSEE] is good but the way it is being done is not so good,” Rumberger said. “The idea of assessing how much kids know by two subjects, math and English [is flawed]. If a kid scores one point less than another kid, should they not get a diploma? It seems so arbitrary.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concert, performed by UCSB’s official University Carillonist and lecturer Wesley Arai, was composed of an eclectic mix of music including contemporary songs composed specifically for the carillon, classical songs by composers such as Mozart and pop hits like “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen as well as the songs “Blackbird” and “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” by the Beatles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dozens of students and families gathered on the lawn under Storke Tower for the concert, sitting on folding chairs and towels while others walked or cycled by, captivated by the sight and sound of Storke Tower bellowing for miles around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon – the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai – sits high in the tower, at 175 feet in the air. The piano-like instrument is played with fists and feet, rather than fingers. The stronger the batons are pushed, the harder the clapper strikes the bell and thus the greater the volume produced, Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most important thing I want is for people to realize that it’s a musical instrument … [the hour chime] that part is automated but the music you hear is played by a real person,”  he said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89703\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89703\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89703\" data-attachment-id=\"89703\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Storke Bells_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89703\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon is the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai has been playing the instrument since his time at UC Berkeley, where he received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics and later obtained his master’s degree in mathematics at UC Los Angeles.

Currently, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the next candidate in line for a major payday. While some may disagree, Wilson seems to be the ideal frontrunner for young quarterbacks on the brink of sealing the coveted “elite” label.</p>\n<p>Constant speculation of the contract negotiations between Wilson and the Seahawks have generated the possibility of him becoming the highest-paid player in the NFL. Despite being drafted as the 75<sup>th</sup> pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft in which five different quarterbacks were drafted before him, Wilson has proved that he belongs and can survive in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Of that 2012 draft class, Wilson, Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill are the only names of quarterbacks that are still prevalent within NFL storylines. While Luck was the No. 1 overall draft pick and first quarterback off the board, Wilson has had the most success out of the 2012 draftees.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Entering the final year of his rookie contract with a set salary of $1.5 million, the Seahawks’ field general is well deserving of a multi-year contract that could make him the NFL’s richest man. With quarterbacks like Cam Newton, Tannehill, RG3 earning contract extensions, and Luck with plans of receiving a surplus of money, the legendary slogan of “numbers never lie” is the one thing that separates Wilson from the rest.</p>\n<p>Since entering the league in 2012, Wilson’s 36 regular-season wins are the most by any quarterback in his first three seasons, he has an NFL-high 15 fourth quarter/comeback victories, and helped lead Seattle to its first Super Bowl win in franchise history out of two consecutive championship trips.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversial play call that resulted with a game-winning interception by Malcolm Butler to secure the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory, it is inevitable that Wilson has completely transformed the Seahawks from being a below average team into a consistent postseason contender. Prior to Wilson’s arrival, Seattle had not won a playoff game since its upset victory versus the New Orleans Saints in 2010.</p>\n<p>Besides proving himself as a quarterback capable of competing and winning at the NFL level, Wilson’s dual-threat skillset is another viable attribute that must be valued during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>His combination of being an efficient pocket passer and his playmaking abilities when on the run are what have allowed him to become one of the NFL’s current best quarterbacks. While injuries have plagued the former 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year in RG3 and Newton possessing these same dual-threat talents, Wilson has perfected the balance between passing and rushing the ball. While the numbers may not show significant changes, Wilson has gradually improved each season in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>However, while Wilson’s performance has been the primary drive behind the Seahawks’ resurgence, the supporting cast of having the NFL’s best defense and arguably best running back in Marshawn Lynch are factors that lead to Seattle’s caution when negotiating the quarterback’s long-term contract.</p>\n<p>Whenever Wilson has been unable to produce for Seattle offensively, it has been the Seahawks defense that has carried the load. Primarily led by original “Legion of Boom” members such as Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas III, the Seahawks defense has consistently ranked amongst the top in points, passing, rushing, and total yards allowed.</p>\n<p>Commonly known for his “Beastmode” moniker, Lynch’s downhill, gritty running style has definitely made Wilson’s quarterbacking job a lot easier. Despite a slow start to his first year as a Seahawk in 2010, Lynch has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.  He tied for an NFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns and finished fifth in total rushing yards with 1,306 this past season.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wilson has yet to throw 30-plus touchdown passes or break the 4,000 yard mark for passing in his career may be alarming for some, but it doesn’t mean the man doesn’t deserve his money. With the addition of tight-end Jimmy Graham, Wilson has another weapon in his arsenal that can help elevate his stature on the field.</p>\n<p>While some may not even consider him to be a top-five NFL quarterback, Wilson has undoubtedly helped turn Seattle into a winning organization. At the end of the day, the Seahawks must realize how valuable of a steal Wilson has been since his arrival in Seattle and can show their appreciation for him with a new contract this offseason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/","id":3280,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3279,3278,3277],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
