Following a prolonged standoff that divided the Senate nearly in half, the meeting abruptly ended just after 5:00 a.m., when Internal Vice President (IVP) Jasmine Sandhu announced that there were no longer enough senators to vote on the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our constituents were still here when people decided to leave,” Senator Grecia Martinez told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the meeting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83178\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83178\" data-attachment-id=\"83178\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/divestment3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"672,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"divestment3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?fit=672%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-83178 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=672%2C480\" alt=\"\" width=\"672\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?w=672&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/divestment3.png?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some of the senators sent proxies, or substitutes, to attend Wednesday’s meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls on UC Santa Barbara, the A.S. Investment Advisory Committee, the UC Treasury and the UC Regents to withdraw investments from companies “that provide military support to the occupation of Palestinian territories.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in companies like General Electric, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which sell military equipment to Israel, shows “implicit support” for the killing of Palestinian civilians, the resolution states.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eighty-nine speakers took the podium at public forum on Wednesday, the vast majority of them speaking about the issue of divestment and the Israel-Palestine conflict at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Senate never got to an actual discussion about the conflict. Instead, the senators fell into a disagreement after Ali Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, told the Senate at public forum that the resolution would be a “positional” and not “directional” piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional resolution “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events,” according to A.S. Legal Code. Typically, the Senate uses these resolutions to adopt an official stance on an issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional resolution, meanwhile, “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committees, and/or the Senate to specific duties” and usually moves to create an actual effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert pointed to individual parts of the resolution’s language, including a phrase about companies “profiting from human rights violations,” to justify her judgment that the resolution called for adopting a position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key difference between the two comes down to voting thresholds. While a positional resolution needs a two-thirds majority to pass, a directional resolution needs only a 50 percent plus one vote majority to be approved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That margin mattered to the divestment vote. Throughout the night, various votes to move the meeting forward stalled at 13-12. As a result, the Senate wound up discussing only the nature of the resolution itself and not its contents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, 13 senators did not want to approve the agenda, which would have codified the resolution as positional. Seeing that they wouldn’t budge, the other 12 senators did not come back from a recess, which forced an early end to the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Brandon Mora and Vanessa Maldonado co-authored the resolution, and students Naia Al-Anbar and Edan Tessema co-sponsored it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was intended to be directional, Maldonado said at the meeting. She emphasized she and Mora did not want the Senate to assume a position on the political or moral issue at the core of divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copies of the resolution provided by A.S. at the meeting stated that the resolution was directional. Sandhu, who chairs the Senate and has the authority to adjust resolutions, later changed it to be positional. Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, deemed it both directional and positional when she spoke at public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution will now be pushed either to next week’s meeting, an emergency meeting or an email vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Alexandra Gessesse and third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao, who substituted for Sophia Uemura, cited language used in past directional resolutions, such as a resolution to support last week’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/afscme-strike-comes-to-an-end-a-s-passes-resolution-in-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as having set a precedent for how directional resolutions should be written. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, you see the senators that came back to the table willing to have the conversation that was necessary to make sure the authors got due diligence, that the communities got due diligence and both sides on UCSB’s campus and all students involved got due diligence,” Gessesse told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse added that she felt the walkout disrespected Sandhu as the Senate chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was disappointing to see people who I would think are committed to this campus, especially in terms of their commitments next year, to not be committed to working through student issues when I’m obviously committed to working on these student issues,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators who were approached for comment after walking out of the meeting asked to be contacted later in the day on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Mineiro, Sanya Kamidi and Maura Fox contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of the graphic in this story listed Adnan Mansur as Sami Kaayal’s proxy.

I remember it very clearly. It was all about how a family was all massacred where the husband survives and has more children,” Miranda said. “This is rather amusing now, but we need to keep in mind that this is all coming from childhood trauma that deals with familial matters.”</p>\n<p>According to Miranda, humor is important to her teaching style because she believes that “Washington is paying her to make other people’s lives miserable,” and it allows her students to be successful in the future.</p>\n<p>“Humor is important from the start. I bring guest professionals in my class that students will not expect, and I feel like I must make people feel intimidated and bring different perspectives by making other people miserable,” Miranda said. “Washington pays me to make people feel miserable.

(Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Principal Researcher of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City Alicia Civera Cerecedo presented a lecture in HSSB on Monday night about the 2014 mass kidnapping of Ayotzinapa students in Iguala, Mexico, and giving a historical account of government corruption surrounding the incident.</p>\n<p>Titled “The Ayotzinapa Student Massacre and the Rural Teacher Training Schools in Mexico: A Historical Perspective,” the event drew around 100 attendees and covered the history of Mexico’s teacher training schools and the September disappearances of 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher’s College of Ayotzinapa. Cerecedo discussed the social movement that arose in Mexico after the kidnappings, the history of teacher training schools in Mexico and baseless narratives that are being forced onto teachers’ reputations by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of the population in Mexico over the age of 15 are in a situation of “lack of education or of not being fully educated,” and people who reside in rural areas have an average education of 6.4 years, according to Cerecedo. She also said Mexican youth are forced to enter cities or migrate to the U.S. because of acute poverty in rural Mexico, and many face challenging economic circumstances and must resort to the drug trade to survive.</p>\n<p>“The civil society is in a state of disbelief and the judicial process day-to-day becomes more apparent that it has been impeded,” said Cerecedo.</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, drug traffickers provide health services and security when the state fails to do so; however the line between government protection and drug cartel protection is becoming increasingly blurred. Cerecedo said drug trafficking is clearly becoming more integrated into the government entity.</p>\n<p>“In the case of Iguala, it became patently clear that drug trafficking is at all levels and in all types of government,” Cerecedo said. “Municipal, state, federal — in the executive, judicial and legislative. In the army as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the Mexican government is using corrupt forms of control and abusing their power by projecting societal problems of illiteracy and poverty onto the teachers. Cerecedo said the Mexican media, which is strictly controlled by the PRI regime, also blames teachers for the failures of the education system.</p>\n<p>Chaos surrounding the education system makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the Ayotzinapa Student Massacre, Cerecedo said.</p>\n<p>“The disappearance of the students happens at a time when you have social conflict and increasing social violence and an economic crisis all coming together,” Cerecedo said. “And it’s at a time when teachers are putting face against PRI authority or challenging the PRI.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the PRI came into power two years ago and has since targeted all opposing political parties or ideologies with hostility.</p>\n<p>“[The PRI] identifies all political parties as a political class without ideas,” Cerecedo said, “[They] are distributing power among themselves which results in a lot of corruption.”</p>\n<p>Cerecedo ended the lecture by saying that Mexico’s political system is essentially based on a “Constitution of a political system that no longer guards the people.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor in the history department and event translator Gabriela Soto Laveaga said she hopes the story of the missing students was thought-provoking for students on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s powerful because … the students who disappeared are your age,” Laveaga said. “I think that’s really poignant. Forty-three people disappeared and were tortured because they were studying.”</p>\n<p>Laveaga said the lecture highlighted to her the vital role student activists play in implementing social change.</p>\n<p>“I think we tend to be really disconnected out here. Sometimes we forget that in most countries its students are the activists,” Laveaga said. “It’s students who are really involved with social change. And maybe Mexico is not that far — it’s our neighbor to our south. And we could be a little more aware of the power of university students in other parts of the world.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Karla Estrada said she attended the event to get a different perspective on the events that unfolded during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to the event because I was aware of the massacre in Iguala and I wanted to get a first-hand account from the professor who is directly from Mexico City,” Estrada said. “She obviously has a really different perspective from professors here in the UC. A lot of my professors talk about what happened, but I felt like I just wanted to get her input.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Kreg Zaragoza said listening to Cerecedo’s lecture first-hand perspective was akin to receiving “insider information.”<br>\n“It’s good to hear from someone who is actually from Mexico,” Zaragoza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/","id":2883,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2882,2881,2880],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
