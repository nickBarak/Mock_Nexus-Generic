Instead, Cal Poly concludes its season 28-28 overall and 17-7 in Big West play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite it being senior day for the Gauchos, it was the young freshman on the mound who really solidified this win for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left-handed pitcher Rodney Boone pitched an amazing game Saturday. In possibly the biggest game of his career, the freshman tossed 8.1 innings, striking out a career-high 12 batters and allowing just five hits and three walks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the plate, UCSB tallied a solid 10 hits to score seven runs. In the previous two games of the series, Santa Barbara had just eight hits and three runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The run support for Boone came early; in the bottom of the first inning, the Gauchos were able to get two across the plate, thanks to an RBI single from sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez and an RBI groundout from junior right fielder Armani Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third, two more were runs scored for UCSB due to RBI singles from Smith and junior center fielder Tommy Jew. Jew was one of the six Santa Barbara athletes to be celebrated on Senior Day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were hoping to chill today and relax with our families but we had to come in ready and locked in. To be able to celebrate with everyone is special,” Jew said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other honorees include right-handed pitchers Alex Patterson, Liam Steigerwald, Kevin Chandler, left fielder Michael McAdoo and left fielder Tevin Mitchell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Jew, the junior went two for four on the day to finish the regular season batting .282 with 39 RBI’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two more runs came across in the fourth, following a triple from shortstop McClain O’Connor which brought in both a run and a sacrifice fly from Martinez to bring in O’Connor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in the seventh, Mitchell blasted his fifth home run of the year to left field, giving his team a commanding 7-0 lead. Mitchell was a standout player for UCSB all year hitting his career-high five home runs and tying the team lead in stolen bases at 20.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As dominant as Boone was, it appeared that Checketts would let him finish the outing off. Instead, the plan was to let him get one final out before bringing in closer Chris Lincoln to finish off the score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After striking out the leadoff batter, Boone got the call and left the field to a standing ovation for his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an awesome moment and an amazing feeling,” Boone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincoln came in needing just two outs to finish off the Mustangs. He struck out the first batter then got the final one to ground to third. Third baseman Jason Willow picked up the ball, spun around and launched it to Kyle Johnson at first who secured the catch for the final out of the ball game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team was all smiles after the ball game, with many players hugging each other and the championship trophy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t explain it. This is probably the happiest I have been in years. I love each and every one of these guys and I just could not be happier,” senior Thomas Rowan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowan was honored last year on Senior day which is why he did not participate in the activities today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past eight seasons, Checketts has accomplished a considerable amount since becoming the head coach of the program. He led the program to many bests including most wins in a single season at the Division 1 level with 45 wins this year and even its first-ever College World Series in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting the program’s first Big West title in 30-plus years is very special and a testament to how far this team has come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSB moves onto bigger things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We struggled with our identities the past few years but this year we found it. If you’re going to come at us, you better give us your best because we are a resilient team and we don’t care who we play in the regionals. We just want to show what we got,” Jew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will find out whether or not they host a regional on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. The team will then find out its bracket at 9 a.m. Monday morning. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

grades</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB teaching assistants started their strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), a monthly stipend of $1,807.51 that would be given to all graduate students to alleviate rising housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students were the last of any UC campus to continue withholding grades, with UCSC submitting earlier this week and other campuses like UC San Diego and UC Davis having been forced to submit grades in early April by campus administration under threat of disciplinary action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email stated that the COLA movement at UCSB “has been ignored, disrespected, or patronized by an administration hoping this movement will wither and die” and explained that the Dean of Graduate Division wouldn’t negotiate with them and instead suggested they seek support at Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 teaching assistants at UCSB were withholding grades prior to Thursday’s announcement, according to various COLA organizers. Graduate students initially expected this number to be higher, but the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meant that teaching assistants who had second and third jobs outside the university were vulnerable to unemployment and were compelled to submit grades to secure their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without foreclosing the withholding of Spring grades, we have made the difficult decision to end our Winter grade strike, and marshal our full strength behind building a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">union-sanctioned unfair labor practice (ULP) strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of February, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), a charge filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act. The Regents alleged that United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW) — the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors — supported wildcat strikes and failed to take action to end the strike, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs against the Regents, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, such as failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union and instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of collecting signatures for a ULP strike, which would be similar in nature to the wildcat strikes — teaching assistants would stop instruction and would withhold grades — but because it would be sanctioned by the union, strikers under UAW are guaranteed protections, according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power to call a strike vote rests with UAW’s bargaining team, and UAW’s Joint Council told the bargaining team that it will recommend a strike vote once its <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ULP_Strike_Pledge\">strike pledge</a> reaches 5,000 signatures.

Yang and UCSB administration to address, which includes changing working conditions for graduate students under the coronavirus pandemic and greater transparency on how the $25 million in stimulus money allotted to UCSB by the federal government will be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are “insisting” that some of this money go towards waiving or alleviating rent in UCSB-owned student and family housing, as well as rent assistance for graduate students living off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also call for a walk-back of all strike-related discipline and a commitment to non-retaliation against all UC wildcats, along with the “reinstatement of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fired UCSC graduate student workers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for current and future appointments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In adapting to these circumstances</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our refocus on alleviating rent and healthcare burden carries on the philosophical core of the COLA demand: that people deserve access to healthcare, housing, and living wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the COLA movement — both at UCSB and UC-wide —  has ceased grade withholding for the time being, organizers are still moving forward with other actions. On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.

After multiple attempts, UCSC was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students launched the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement in the fall, asking for a proposed monthly stipend of $1,412 to supplement teaching assistants’ (TA) salaries in the face of rising housing prices. Although the movement comes after years of organizing around the issue, UCSC graduate students officially went on a wildcat strike, meaning action without union support, on Dec. 9, 2019. Until now, they have refused to upload grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC Graduate Student Association President </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yulia Gilichinskaya criticized UCSC’s decision to change all missing grades to pass grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The administration has shifted the burden of missing grades from themselves and onto the undergraduates it purports to care for and educate. We cannot allow this,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that some of the students work really hard and really care about getting an A or getting a B. And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system. UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went on full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 27,  meaning TAs ceased teaching and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 55 UCSB graduate students are currently withholding winter quarter grades, according to Sheila Kulkarni, a chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D. student and the Recording Secretary for the UCSB unit of United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW), the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students are beginning to shift from withholding grades to pushing for UAW’s support in striking against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleging that UAW supported wildcat strike efforts and failed to take action to end the strike, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ULP against UAW. Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Buckley was 260-231-1 during his tenure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his firing, however, LBSU has managed to turn things around a bit. After starting the season 5-26, Long Beach State has won six of its last 15 games, including a sweep of UC Riverside — the only team to take two of three from the Gauchos this season — and nearly knocking off No. 1 UCLA this past Tuesday, losing in 12 innings 2-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That may not seem like much, but it does highlight about how far this program has come in just the past month of play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, even in those 15 contests, LBSU has tallied 130 hits which is about eight hits per game, a solid number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s .259 batting average as a whole might not seem great over the past 15, but it is up more than 48 points than where it was before. Overall, the team sports a .234 batting average which is dead last in the conference but, again, higher than it was before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LBSU’s pitching staff has also been revived during conference play. The Dirtbags have allowed the second-least hits (121) in conference play. The staff also holds the second-best ERA (4.67).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, despite LBSU’s record, the team does put up a fight in each contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve of Long Beach State’s last 15 games have been decided by two runs or fewer, with seven of those meetings being decided by just one run. The Dirtbags have gone just 1-6 in those seven one-run games and are 3-2 in matches decided by two runs over that span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a few more things go right for them in some of these games, LBSU might be contending for a title as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UCSB should still roll through the Dirtbags. The Gauchos’ pitching staff has combined to strike out 399 batters this season, topping the Big West. LBSU strikes out a good amount with 323 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Santa Barbara’s offensive firepower might be too much for the Dirtbags to even think of overcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right fielder Armani Smith has been on a tear lately as he currently owns a nine-game hitting streak. During that stretch, Smith has had five multiple hit games and gone an impressive 14 for 34 (.411) while also scoring seven runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recent stretch has also seen his batting average jump 24 points as he now sports a .319 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Martinez, Calif. native has accumulated one fourth of his total RBIs this season in just the last nine games for a total of 10. Smith also has 10 homers on the season, second best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Gauchos have been especially tough to beat at home, owning an impressive 22-1 record in home games this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has won 15 consecutive games in Santa Barbara with the team’s last home loss coming on Mar. 17 against Cal Baptist. If the team can sweep, UCSB will have set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos last set that record in 2016 when they won 17 consecutive games. That was the same year UCSB went to its first ever College World Series. Coincidence? I guess we’ll find out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First pitch between LBSU and UCSB will begin at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
