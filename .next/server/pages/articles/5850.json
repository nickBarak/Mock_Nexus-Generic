The event delivered, with an arsenal of buttery complimentary popcorn at the entrance, a plethora of film posters and a swiss army knife, ready to be given away to lucky prize winners. Upon stepping into the screening area, the first sight was that of the night’s special guest, who looked nearly indistinguishable from the college students who surrounded him, chatting to a large group of curious and attentive viewers.</p>\n<p>“Swiss Army Man,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the story of Hank, played by Paul Dano (“Little Miss Sunshine” and “Love and Mercy”), who is stranded on a desert island. He discovers a corpse named Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame), whose body has special powers. Hank manipulates Manny’s powers, which consist of a number of odd bodily functions, to navigate their way back home. Throughout their hilarious and heartfelt journey, Hank teaches Manny what it is like to be alive and Manny reminds Hank of what it is like to not be alone.</p>\n<p>The movie thrived off of its disarming and offbeat humor, in a series of uncomfortably funny moments in which Manny attempts to understand and adapt to the conventions of the world. Yet, it displays a vulnerable, raw human connection between Dano’s lonely and undeniably relatable Hank and Radcliffe’s compassionate corpse.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film was written and directed by Scheinert and his creative partner Daniel Kwan, who, together, call themselves The Daniels. This is Scheinert and Kwan’s first feature film. However, the two previously garnered internet fame through their innovative music videos for artists such as Foster The People and The Shins. One of their more terrifically absurd videos, created for Lil Jon’s song “Turn Down for What,” was even played before the screening of the film. Second-year Erin Sim remarked, “It was so interesting to see how their style translated from the music videos to the big screen. It was obvious some of their previous work influenced the movie, especially in terms of the special effects.”</p>\n<p>Following the screening, Scheinert climbed onstage as T. Rex’s “I Love to Boogie” blasted through the speakers of the auditorium. He explained that he “drove down from L.A. with a bunch of [his] friends with that song on repeat throughout the whole trip,” and expressed his newfound distaste for it. During a Q&amp;A session, he mentioned that the film contained many musical inside jokes much like that one, including a ballad rendition of “Cotton Eye Joe” performed by the directors’ friends, Manchester Orchestra, and the frequently hummed tune of Jurassic Park. “I always hum that or ‘Kiss from a Rose,’ by Seal, [while working with Kwan],” Scheinert joked.</p>\n<p>The audience was graced with tidbits of trivia, including how the appearance of a fictional creature in the film came to be. “Daniel Radcliffe’s bodyguard dressed up as Bigfoot one day and just ran in the back of shots,” Scheinert revealed. And when asked where the multitude of fart sounds littered throughout the movie were obtained, he chuckled, replying, “I guess it’s kind of illegal, but we actually took tracks from this video online called ‘101 Real Farts’ … We wanted the farts to be unique, because every one was supposed to be a character development moment.” As the audience roared with laughter, he expressed his hopes that “someone will recognize their own fart in [the] movie.”</p>\n<p>One audience member commended Scheinert on the impact of the film, explaining that they had gotten up to go to the bathroom during the middle of the movie, but upon seeing “everyone in pure awe, laughing and smiling” they rethought their decision. Scheinert alluded that the film’s creation process was similar: hard to abandon. He advised aspiring filmmakers to “make sure your movie is fun to make,” and to treat it like “a therapy project.”</p>\n<p>“This was one of the best audiences I think we’ve seen,” said Stephanie Lynch, Scheinert’s girlfriend. “It was a really great group of people. Everyone was so into it; it was really cute.”</p>\n<p>The turnout seemed to impress a fair few people. “This was one of the best [screening experiences] we’ve ever had,” said Magic Lantern producer DJ Palladino. “There were these guys from Ventura who made [‘Bellflower’], which The New Yorker called ‘the future of cinema’ and these guys came and they were amazing, and there were only twenty-five people in the audience. ”</p>\n<p>The evening ended in a way left up to individual interpretation, much like the film did, when Scheinert was asked what the point of “Swiss Army Man” was. Implying it was a reflection of his and Kwan’s journey as filmmakers, he added, “It’s sort of about how we all make up movies in our head.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/director-of-sundance-fave-chats-with-magic-lantern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/director-of-sundance-fave-chats-with-magic-lantern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/director-of-sundance-fave-chats-with-magic-lantern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/director-of-sundance-fave-chats-with-magic-lantern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/director-of-sundance-fave-chats-with-magic-lantern/","id":5850,"author":{"id":709,"name":"Tamara Luechinger"},"related":[5849,5848,5847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":709,"name":"Tamara Luechinger","biography":"Not available","articles":[5850,6720],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Artsweek Summer Movie Preview","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wehrung.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wehrung.jpg?resize=597%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Resident snarky/sassy/savvy film critic Alex Wehrung offers up his summer recommendations to moviegoers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Summer is upon us, and that means that blockbuster season is about to come in full swing.

Dory, the amnesiac regal blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres (aka mediocre Oscar host number 39) suddenly recalls her childhood memories. Knowing she has to head to California, she sets her sights for Morro Bay and goes on a journey, with Nemo and his father, Marlin, following right behind. With almost the entire cast and crew of the original back for a second outing, it looks likely that Pixar will craft another great sequel. (Cars 2?

And now, his first sequel is invading cinemas.</p>\n<p>Taking place after the original big-budget B-movie, “Resurgence” sees humanity, armed with enhanced alien weaponry hacked from the last one, going on the defense once again as they return to destroy our famous landmarks. But with the help of Will Smi…wait, what? He’s not in this one? Then who did they get? Liam Hemsworth? Oh. Eh.</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, expect to turn off your brain when this comes around.

As to be expected in a Trek film, there are badass aliens, a lotta lasers shooting all over the place and some banter thrown in for good measure.</p>\n<p>With Justin Lin in the director’s chair instead of J.J. Abrams, it remains to be seen if he can keep up the storytelling energy of the last two. At the very least, Lin can drink the tears of all the Trekkies clamoring for less action and more politics. Sorry guys; it ain’t happening.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters July 22.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The BFG</strong></p>\n<p>Are you feeling the ‘Berg? Yeah, that’s all I got.</p>\n<p>The newest entry in Steven Spielberg’s long filmography, “BFG” is an adaptation of the classic children’s novel written by Road Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film involves a little girl named Sophie encountering a gigantic man (Mark Rylance) whom she calls BFG, or Big Friendly Giant.</p>\n<p>After “Bridge of Spies,” it should be fun to see Spielberg regress back into more sentimental fare. And having never read the book, I am personally looking forward to watching this adaptation. Plus, hearing another John Williams score never hurts.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters July 1.</em><br>\n<strong>Suicide Squad</strong></p>\n<p>If anything, this movie will either be the Lazarus pit or the crowbar to the head for the DC movie universe. Props if you get the references.</p>\n<p>Bringing together a huge ensemble cast, “Suicide Squad” follows a squad of super-baddies who have been recruited by government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Their mission: Go kill other bad guys.</p>\n<p>The biggest draw of this film is, of course, finally getting to see the likes of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Waller, etc. on the big screen, as well as Jared Leto’s take on the Joker. Thus far, the film’s marketing has been killer, showcasing the quirky charms of the squad, using some pretty fun music and keeping plot details under some impressively taut wraps.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Aug. 5.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snowden</strong></p>\n<p>Well, this isn’t exactly high-octane popcorn fare or the like, but it ought to be fascinating.</p>\n<p>Now that I have turned you off the film, let’s get down to the details. If the title didn’t tip you off already, “Snowden” is an account of the life of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). After getting a job at the NSA, he realizes the extent of its surveillance powers, and decides to take action.</p>\n<p>Even though all of us AP Gov. survivors know how this ends, the experience should hopefully be worth it; director Oliver Stone is most famous for his political thrillers, and Gordon-Levitt has Snowden’s appearance and voice down to a tee.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Sept. 16.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</strong></p>\n<p>I started off writing about “The Magnificent Seven,” a remake of a remake. Then I saw three seconds of footage from this movie and changed my mind.</p>\n<p>Essentially X-Men with a healthy dose of Tim Burton, “Miss Peregrine’s” is about Jacob, a boy who arrives at an orphanage run by the titular Miss Peregrine (played by ex-Bond girl Eva Green). At this orphanage, every child has a particular, peculiar trait, like a little girl with a mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth in the back of her head.</p>\n<p>Burton is the master of the weird, although his adaptations have been wavering in quality in recent years. Will this redeem him for “Alice in Wonderland?” Perhaps if we say the title three times, it will make it so.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Sept. 30.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/","id":5847,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5846,5845,5844],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘All the Way’ Captures Election Anxiety","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14494757_1089209467830009_5130324900963372213_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14494757_1089209467830009_5130324900963372213_n.jpg?resize=720%2C270&ssl=1","description":"Johnson became president in the worst way he could have imagined — in the wake of John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the swirling buzz around Election Day, last Wednesday night seemed an appropriate time for UCSB’s Pollock Theatre’s screening of the HBO film “All The Way,” a biopic of Lyndon B. Johnson’s tumultuous 1964 campaign for presidency. The event also featured a Q&amp;A with the film’s director, Jay Roach, (of “Meet the Parents” and “Austin Powers” fame) which treated students and moviegoers to a night of lively discussion about the film and its portrayal of the complex presidential candidate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson became president in the worst way he could have imagined — in the wake of John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. A Texan Democrat brought to power by the support of Southern Democrats, Johnson faced enormous political pressure from a party divided between conservative “Dixiecrats” and Northern liberals. Caught between loyalty to his fellow Southerners and the moral imperative of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Johnson was forced to make tough decisions concerning Civil Rights. “I will drag the South out of the past kicking and screaming if I have to,” Johnson, played by Brian Cranston, says, decisively staking his presidency on the controversial Civil Rights Act. The film focuses on the generational divide between young radicals and older conservatives, portraying Johnson as moderate, yet innovative. “The South won’t like it, but this is how new things are born,” he argues. This innovation becomes the driving force of his campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film depicts several important events of the Civil Rights Movements that occurred during Johnson’s campaign, such as the murder of three Mississippi Freedom Summer Project volunteers, who went missing after registering blacks in Mississippi to vote, and the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, during which Mississippi’s all-white delegates walked out to protest the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party’s attendance. Johnson’s frustration with the South is a source of constant anxiety, but director Jay Roach portrays him as a man who sticks to his guns. “I believe in the power of the government to do good,” Roach explained during the Q&amp;A after the film. “I really wanted to emphasize that Johnson tried to do the right thing.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were more than a few nuances to Cranston’s character. Roach portrayed Johnson as a bully to his wife and to numerous people who crossed him. He is also depicted several times in moments of deep self-pity, moaning from his bed that “everyone is against [him].” However, every moment of weakness is contrasted by a moment of power — Johnson declaring that “politics is war” and telling senators that he “will crush them” if they stand in his way of passing the Civil Rights Act, to name a few. The film’s nuanced portrayal of Johnson called to mind today’s presidential candidates and asked the viewer what kind of qualities they want to see in a president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ryan, director of Pollock Theatre, commented that the movie seems to be relevant to the current election season, noting that voter intimidation in the film is much like the voter intimidation on the news today. From the recent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vandalization</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a church in Mississippi, which was spray-painted with the tag “Vote Trump,” to Trump’s support of restrictive voter ID laws, the 1964 campaign is more relevant than ever. In one of the film’s most powerful scenes, Johnson asks a Georgia senator threatening to walk out of the Democratic National Convention “what side of history he wants to be on.” Present day voters might ask themselves the same question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All The Way” could also inspire students and members of the community to vote and appreciate the effectiveness of grassroots campaigning. The political pressure groups such as SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) put on Johnson made a difference in his decision-making. Dr. King, played by Anthony Mackie, tells SNCC in the film that “Johnson isn’t going to give anything to us. We have to take it.” The movie demonstrates that voting is not a right to take for granted, and the effectiveness of grassroots campaigning is motivation to participate in the election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening ended with a small reception with food in the lobby. Movie goers were left with lots to think about. Perhaps the most striking realization about Johnson is that he was able to shed the legacy of the “accidental” president following Kennedy’s assassination. His campaign proved that he was capable of leading a divided Democratic party and earning the nomination in his own right.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The series delves into the complicated history of the parks’ development from the 1850s on and elucidates the case for conservation of the nation’s treasured resources and landscapes. As a supplement, series writer and producer Dayton Duncan comes to Campbell Hall on Nov. 15 to speak on how the National Park idea and project has developed; Duncan is just one of many speakers visiting this season in the National Parks series.</p>\n<p>Other programs on the lineup celebrating the wonders of natural spaces include a flight of short films by Telluride Mountainfilm on Oct. 20, and a pair of National Geographic Live events, where wildlife filmmaker Bob Poole will demonstrate his conservationist work in Mozambique (Oct. 30) and photojournalist Brian Skerry his own in the world’s oceans (Nov. 20). All take place right here in Campbell Hall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Samples from A&amp;L’s impressive slate of musical acts include performances by soul saxophonist Maceo Parker, known for his work with legends like James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic and Prince, on Oct. 27 at Campbell. Sonically flexible songsmith Neko Case will also bring her stuff to Campbell, on Nov. 18.</p>\n<p>On the folkier side, renowned singer, songwriter and social activist Joan Baez will grace the Arlington on Nov. 3. Aside from her impressive body of work, Baez’s message warrants attendance; her activism has made her friend of the likes of Martin Luther King Jr. For those who like their folk more contemporary, Iron &amp; Wine will be plucking away solo this Sunday the 25 at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The Word of Mouth series highlights a spread of distinguished speakers covering a range of poignant and consequential topics for an informed citizenry. Lauded political advisor and analyst Fareed Zakaria will apply national and global perspectives on this year’s inflatedly consequential presidential election on Sept. 27 at the Granada. On Nov. 14, Captain Scott Kelly, a NASA Astronaut and the first American to spend an entire year in space, will bring his unique perspective to his speaking event at the same theater.</p>\n<p>A&amp;L this season features dance performances for both bunheads and sneakerheads. On Oct. 8, the Alonzo King LINES Ballet company pushes the envelope of the intricate genre and brings it spinning into the skies of the Granada with aerial techniques. On the 25, Lil Buck, a Memphis disciple of the city’s interdisciplinary jookin’ dance style, brings his footwork to the same stage. Having worked with titans like Yo-Yo Ma and Madonna, Buck promises to impress with his genre-melting flurry of hip-hop, jazz, ballet and modern.</p>\n<p>Comedy fans, i.e., people, will be glad to chuckle at “Whose Live Anyway?,” the live and on-the-road version of beloved improv show “Whose Line.” Show-goers can count on shouting suggestions at series regulars Greg Proops and Ryan Stiles on Nov. 9, and might even get to join them on the Granada stage. Comedy podcast king Marc Maron of “WTF” fame will bring his darkly honest humor to a stand-up set at Campbell Hall on Oct. 21.</p>\n<p>Virtually all of these events are ticketed at a discounted price of $10-$15 for students, but for many of us that indulgence can be denting. A&amp;L’s free events this season include the aforementioned screenings of the National Parks docuseries, and a presentation at Campbell from photographer Q.T. Luong showcasing his stunning work capturing these protected lands on Nov. 2. Free screenings include “Sonita,” the story of a Tehran teen with aspirations to be the next Rihanna (Nov. 30 at Campbell), and “Screenagers,” a doc exploring the psychology of excessive tech time on the developing brain (Oct. 16, Arlington). A&amp;L will also host speakers like author Larissa MacFarquhar (Oct. 5), artists Françoise Mouly and Anita Kunz (Oct. 17), and Father Gregory Boyle (Oct. 18), all at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Beyond fall quarter, the year’s lineup include the likes of outspoken leader in feminist thought and action Gloria Steinem, cello virtuoso Yo-Yo Ma, and Alton Brown speaking about food science. Find tickets to all these events and more on their website, artsandlectures.sa.ucsb.edu, and learn yourself a thing or two.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/coming-soon-to-a-campus-near-you/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/coming-soon-to-a-campus-near-you/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/coming-soon-to-a-campus-near-you/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/coming-soon-to-a-campus-near-you/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/coming-soon-to-a-campus-near-you/","id":5849,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[5848,5847,5846],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
