There were no known witnesses to the crime and no arrests have been made.</p>\n<p>Congregation leaders at St. Michael’s University Church said in a statement they believe the vandalism to be connected to the church’s recent decision to display signs in favor of LGBTQ rights and “Black Lives Matter” signs.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed about this incident of vandalism on our church campus,” the statement reads. “[We] are especially concerned that it has occurred following the decision to display a rainbow flag and several ‘Black Lives Matter’ placards around the property.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, there is little for the department to say at this point in the investigation because of a lack of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>“[The officers] searched the area but were not able to locate anyone connected to the crime and no arrests have been made in the case,” Hoover said in an email. “There were no known witnesses in the crime.”</p>\n<p>Church leaders said they also believe the unknown criminal may be struggling emotionally.</p>\n<p>“We suspect the person who did this is hurting and angry,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Luke Bucklew said he believes the vandals were “not in their right mind” while causing the damage.</p>\n<p>“Maybe the people who did it were drunk or not in their right mind when they committed this act of hate and chaos,” Bucklew said. “I think it’s tragic that people in the city feel the need to vandalize property in whatever state of mind they’re in — inebriated or not.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

activists, known as the Feminasty Guardians, marched through Isla Vista Friday to  reach the scene of the altercation that inspired their protest against rape culture at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Katherine Kepski, the leader of the protest, encountered a woman outside her home on Sept. 16 who was being verbally abused by her boyfriend. The woman had allegedly been sexually assaulted by the man’s best friend while unconscious, and Kepski attempted to assist her.</p>\n<p>The event featured a representative of the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, members of the Student Activist Network and various members of UCSB fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>Numbering over a hundred strong at the beginning of the event, the protest began at the Pardall Center with a speech by a Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center advocate. She asked, “What can we do to make our streets feel safer?” and called on students to intervene, remain vocal and share their stories.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Students are marching through Isla Vista to 67 Sabado Tarde Road in protest of rape culture at UC Santa Barbara. <a href=\"https://t.co/baB1lX2HYa\">https://t.co/baB1lX2HYa</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LL5gSpD6Yv\">pic.twitter.com/LL5gSpD6Yv</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/787149677334441984\">October 15, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The congregation marched through the streets of I.V. starting on Pardall Road, rounding the loop past 7-Eleven and continuing through Del Playa Road.</p>\n<p>Partygoers on Del Playa issued a mixed response to the protesters, as some fervently joined in from their backyard chanting “2, 4, 6, 8, stop the violence, stop the rape” or “hey hey, ho ho, the patriarchy has got to go,” while others tepidly mocked the display, adding unrelated quips about party culture.</p>\n<p>Regardless, all eyes on Del Playa were locked on the protest, with phones up documenting a crowd which grew to over 150 protesters of mixed gender, identity and race.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73219\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2134225290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73214\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73219\" data-attachment-id=\"73219\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/feminasty-guardians-protest-against-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73219\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=350%2C525\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73219\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Orchid Divine, third year UCSB student, hoists a sign in support of survivors of sexual assault.

A woman with the Feminasty Guardians spoke about her enlightening experience in coming out about her sexuality and the aggression she found fighting against it. Kepski brought up Eric Daniel Villalobos, a representative from the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p>Villalobos explained that the Student Activist Network is a new group on campus dedicated to promoting activism and that they helped organize speakers for this event, plan its route and inform possible participants and onlookers.</p>\n<p>The Rapid Response Network, he added, is a service that will notify students about events regarding “struggles of racial justice, environmental degradation, discrimination against the LGBTQ community and issues of immigration.”</p>\n<p>The march ended with a final statement from Kepski.</p>\n<p>“We have to continue this conversation. This is just the beginning”.</p>\n<p>Though the march had ended, a group of at least 20 students continued chanting back through Del Playa Drive to Pardall Road, continuing to spread their message.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_73217\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1204770414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73214\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73217\" data-attachment-id=\"73217\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/feminasty-guardians-protest-against-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/fem-rally-by-oliver-zuniga-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Student Activist Network\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73217 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fem-Rally-by-Oliver-Zuniga-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Student Activist Network is a new group on campus created to organize activists. <em>Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff Department’s investigation report concluded that Rodger engaged in two separate gunfire incidents with officers before he fatally shot himself. The report states Santa Barbara Sheriff Sergeant Brad Welch, Detective Brian Flick and deputies Adrian Marquez and Jorden Walker acted “in defense of others” and “in an attempt to arrest a dangerous felon.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the DA’s report found the police took proper action given the circumstances.</p>\n<p>“The report validates our agency’s belief that the deputies acted lawfully and properly,” Hoover said in an email. “We are grateful for the swift and resolute actions taken by our deputies which we believe saved the lives of many others.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said the deputies fired their guns at the suspect to prevent him from hurting more people.</p>\n<p>“The deputies were fired upon by a suspect who had already killed several people,” Hoover said in an email. “Their aim was to stop him, and by firing upon him, they accomplished that.”</p>\n<p>The report states the first officer-involved gunfire battle occurred at 9:32 p.m. at 6550 Del Playa Drive when Marquez returned one round after Rodger shot multiple rounds at Marquez from Rodger’s black BMW.</p>\n<p>“As the BMW quickly sped by westbound, Deputy Marquez fired one shot at the vehicle,” the report reads. “He was not able to determine if he hit the suspect. The forensic investigation later determined that his round hit the right side of the suspect vehicle.”</p>\n<p>According to the report, the second gun battle involved officers Welch, Flick, Walker and Johnson at Little Acorn Park. The officers fired numerous shots at Rodger and grazed his hip.</p>\n<p>“Fearing for their lives and the lives of their fellow deputies, and in an attempt to apprehend the suspect who had just killed at least three people and wounded dozens of others, Sgt. Welch, Detective Flick, and Deputy Walker fired at the vehicle,” the report reads. “Rounds hit the vehicle several times on the left side and rear, with only one confirmed round entering the vehicle.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said he was riding his bike by the 7-Eleven when Rodger shot two of the bikers in front of him.</p>\n<p>“The whole time I kind of thought it was a gang shooting,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>Zohoori said one of the law enforcement officers fulfilled his duty by immediately running into the 7-Eleven where Zohoori was hiding after the bikers nearby him were shot by Rodger.</p>\n<p>“That was the most comforting and best thing in the world,” Zohoori said. “I think their actions that night served their purpose as officers to serve and protect. I’m really happy to say that they served and acted lawfully.”</p>\n<p>The report states the officers found Rodger in his BMW on Del Playa Drive with a through-and-through self-inflicted gunshot wound to his right temple.</p>\n<p>“Approximately one minute after the shooting in Little Acorn Park, the suspect vehicle crashed and the suspect shot himself in the head,” the report reads.</p>\n<p>The DA report states had it not been for the officers’ actions the night of May 23 last year many more lives would have been lost and the file on the investigation of the officer-involved shootings is now closed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64656\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64656\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/","id":4651,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4650,4649,4648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB County Planning Commission Finds an Increase in I.V.

Students and long-term residents attended the meeting to give input during public comment, all of whom rebutted the survey results. The event ended with the Commission promising to hold another meeting addressing the issue of parking in I.V. to better incorporate the community and for staff to develop a new survey.</p>\n<p>Planning and Development staff member David Lackey said the survey found 34 new parking spots due to elimination of designated red curb areas, new measurements, car share programs and overall reduced total vehicles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination of factors that concluded that the overall parking spaces that were available were actually increasing as the capacity has remained the same,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Second District SB County Planning Commissioner Cecilia Brown said there has been an increase in student population at UCSB and in I.V. since 2004.</p>\n<p>“But from what I understand, there has been a decrease in vehicles in that community,” Brown said. “Is that a fair statement?”</p>\n<p>Lackey said in terms of a “general trend,” certain demographics such as younger populations are not bringing single personal vehicles in the community.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the many factors that were identified in the parking survey in 2013,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associated Students (A.S.) representative Ethan Bertrand said overcrowding I.V. is unsafe and the community’s interests need to be taken into account when looking at I.V.’s future regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“There has been various outreach to the community, but I would say those have been ineffective and I would say we [the community] haven’t been provided with a chance to provide input and consideration to this,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Chair Pegeen Soutar said IVRPD requests the I.V. Master Plan process be postponed and sent back to the community for review. Soutar also asked that IVRPD to be the lead agency to gather input from the community on all matters related to recreation and parks.</p>\n<p>“Since the Master Plan was first created, we find it to be inconsistent with the active community plan for our parks,” Soutar said. “It is very hard to find parking in Isla Vista at all. As far as your study, we cannot find parking at all. I’m not sure where that 15 percent paring is at folks, but we’re not finding it.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, it is very difficult to find coastal access parking in I.V., especially when people come from out of town for recreational activities.</p>\n<p>“We have excellent surf spots out there,” Soutar said. “And trust me, there are hundreds of people that when the surf is going, they want to come into town and that is a huge problem.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Sue Dickson said she wants amendments for the Master Plan to be postponed because the plan no longer accurately reflects community needs and does not address the density, parking and development issues in the current drought.</p>\n<p>“The Master Plan itself is flawed and out of date,” Dickson said. “A lot of change has taken place in Isla Vista since it has been originally written. Much of the report is no longer relevant. I did not receive any outreach.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Susan Wickham said she was not notified regarding meetings about the I.V. Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“You need to bring the community back into the conversation and let us have an opportunity to acknowledge the changes and the whole plan as it goes through the process,” Wickham said. “I believe the survey needs to be redone.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Maia said I.V. residents are double parking, parking nose to tail with no space in between, parking on dirt lots and in other people’s lots and that land owners are charging for parking.</p>\n<p>“Now it is summer and students are gone mostly. I’ve seen the fewest parking spaces in any of the summers,” Maia said. “There’s no places for visitors to go. This is our personal experience and surveys don’t necessarily reflect that. Why would landlords be charging for parking when there’s lot of spaces?”</p>\n<p>I.V. Project Committee Chair Teddy Warfield said it is not beneficial for those who are not residents of I.V. to create plans for the community.</p>\n<p>“I have to mention the arrogant and high-handed services your county staff has provided for the Isla Vista Master Plan Project and this process,” Warfield said. “I never received any notice that this process was going on. Your staff has served us poorly in this process.”</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs Paola DeLa Cruz said the survey is incorrect; there is no parking in I.V. and apartment complexes charge up to $300 for parking spaces, a fee many students cannot afford.</p>\n<p>“The information that you have in front of you is inaccurate and definitely does not address safety in Isla Vista,” DeLa Cruz said.</p>\n<p>First District SB County Commissioner C. Michael Cooney said community expectations are not being met, particularly concerns of the student body and long-term residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“As an overall observation, I didn’t hear any support for our actions today,” Cooney said. “We have to emphasize to the Board of Supervisors that we need to look at the overall Master Plan through the eyes of the current Isla Vista, concerned Isla Vista population.”</p>\n<p>Third District SB County Commissioner Joan Hartmann said there needs to be more outreach in I.V. and increased community input to make a “reasonable” decision regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“I think we must ensure that people know what is happening and we need to do a better job. I’d like some assurances,” Hartmann said. “In terms of the parking, what we see here in the survey results is that there is enough parking but according to the community, that is not the case.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-07/sb-county-planning-commission-finds-an-increase-in-i-v-parking-community-disagrees/","id":4652,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4651,4650,4649],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
