policies include a 72-hour evacuation timeline, an interactive county map and new storm evacuation definitions. Residents can type their address into the map to determine whether they are in a high-risk area.</p>\n<p>At the time of the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides, the UC Santa Barbara Emergency Flip Chart did not outline specific procedures. The section of the chart titled “severe weather” says to monitor media reports, campus emails and ensure that roads are safe before leaving.</p>\n<p>For those experiencing severe weather at home, it says not to take risks to reach campus.</p>\n<p>“We have to continue to get better and learn more from every disaster,” said Santa Barbara County First District Supervisor Das Williams at a press conference. “We want to prepare this community for the next event and for the continued clean-up.”</p>\n<p>Montecito Fire Protection District Division Chief Kevin Taylor said that the goal of these policies is to outline clearly the risks of impending storms, with a focus on the areas affected by the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p>The county is urging citizens to sign up for alerts to ensure that they are aware of any weather changes.</p>\n<p>During the Thomas Fire, two alerts were sent out through UCSB Alerts to correct the erroneous evacuation order issued by county officials and to alert students about the health risks at local beaches.</p>\n<p>Associate Vice Chancellor John Longbrake said in an email that “unfortunately” only about 4,000 students subscribe to text alerts for UCSB Alerts. He encouraged students to sign up to receive these alerts at <em>alert.ucsb.edu.</em></p>\n<p>The county’s new policies outline a timeline for the 72 hours before a storm arrives. There will first be a pre-evacuation advisory, then a recommended evacuation warning and then a mandatory evacuation order.</p>\n<p>The Storm Evacuation Definitions says that with a mandatory evacuation order, “extreme risk for loss of property and life exists,” and that “personal discretion is not an option.”</p>\n<p>In a press conference last week, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown spoke about the possibility of future strong weather.</p>\n<p>“A strong possibility exists that we will need to call for future evacuations,” he said. “While evacuations are inconvenient and troublesome, they are also temporary and incredibly important. Most importantly, they can be life-saving.”</p>\n<p>In the case of an evacuation, university policies are also vague. According to the Flip Chart, the UCSB Emergency Operation Center Executive Policy Group has the power to implement an evacuation in the case of a “major emergency.”</p>\n<p>During the Thomas Fire, many students were frustrated about the poor air quality and the quality of the masks given out by the university.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Student Health Services (SHS) typically keeps about 5,000 N95 masks on hand and ordered an additional 18,000 during the fire, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>Estrada said that surgical masks were distributed as a temporary measure.</p>\n<p>After the initial supply of 5,000 masks was distributed and SHS was waiting for delivery of additional N95 masks, surgical masks were distributed as a temporary measure.</p>\n<p>“But students were advised to return to Student Health to pick up the recommended N95 masks,” she said in email.</p>\n<p>The fire impacted patient care at SHS as well.</p>\n<p>Estrada said that while SHS stayed open, its employees were unable to access electronic medical records during the blackouts and used “emergency procedures” for paper communication.</p>\n<p>SHS has a backup generator that it used during these periods for essential services, such as keeping vaccines at proper temperatures and lighting.</p>\n<p>According to Estrada, generators on campus are tested on a monthly basis, with an annual test where building emergency systems are transferred to the generator to simulate an actual event.</p>\n<p>Estrada also said that the campus implemented several policies to respond to the fire, including a mutual aid provision among UC campuses, an Emergency Leave from Work provision and a memorandum of understanding between UCSB and the Red Cross that enabled the Red Cross to host a shelter on UCSB property.</p>\n<p>The campus communicated to students through email, a page on the UCSB Current, social media channels, a special Call Center that was created to field calls related to the fire and a banner on the website.</p>\n<p>Longbrake also recommended that students and other community members sign up for alerts from the county’s emergency alert system, Aware &amp; Prepare at <em>awareandprepare.org.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss a resolution regarding bicycles stopping at stop signs and a bill on increasing transparency within A.S.</p>\n<p>The resolution, titled “A Resolution Calling upon UCPD, and Santa Barbara Sheriff Department, and the California Highway Patrol to Allow Bicycles to Treat Stop Signs and Red Lights as Yield Signs,” called for adoption of Idaho Stop, which allows bicyclists to legally treat stop signs as yield signs. This has been Idaho state law since 1982, but has yet to be implemented anywhere else. The Senate item, “A Bill to Increase Transparency and Oversight of Student Fees,” would make the use of student fees and the funding of campus entities clearer to the public.</p>\n<p>In open forum, second-year math major Andrew Pragin said the Idaho Stop would be impractical off-campus.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve been out in the community of Isla Vista, been to the meetings on bike safety, you’d know that the Idaho Stop resolution is not feasible at all,” Pragin said. “UCPD can have the Idaho Stop on campus. [That’s] totally fine until people leave campus to go to I.V. [because] laws change.”</p>\n<p>Pragin also said there could be problems with enforcement, as it would most likely be a county ordinance and not a state law.</p>\n<p>“People can start yielding at stop signs in I.V. because that’s county land. If you want the county to write an ordinance, all right, but then similar problem, Idaho is a state,” Pragin said. “People would come into the county and have to obey a different law than other places in the state, and it’s kind of weird, and it gives liability to the county.”</p>\n<p>Pragin also said the “real problem” is bicyclists’ reluctance to follow traffic laws.</p>\n<p>“What problem are you trying to solve with this resolution, the fact that people are getting tickets?” Pragin said, “They’re getting tickets because they’re not following the law. They’re not stopping at the stop signs, and it’s dangerous. People don’t care; they seem to want to kill themselves.”</p>\n<p>Pragin said I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) should better enforce stop sign laws in I.V.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68409\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68409\" data-attachment-id=\"68409\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/senate_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68409\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“They approach the stop signs as if they don’t exist. The problem is, we’re not enforcing [the law]. That’s why people are complaining when they get tickets,” Pragin said, “because they don’t get tickets. I’d rather you pass a resolution that said to follow laws.”</p>\n<p>Jerel Constantino, off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he will remove Idaho Stop language from the current resolution, but he plans to bring it up again later this year.</p>\n<p>“I’m pulling the language regarding the Idaho Stop from the resolution, not because I don’t believe in the Idaho Stop, but because it is not a good time politically as this issue is already contentious in itself. I’ll be back,” Constantino said. “The resolution will just be to give bike committee further funding, support their efforts along with IVFP and university affiliates regarding bike safety education.”</p>\n<p>“A Resolution Calling upon UCPD, and Santa Barbara Sheriff Department, and the California Highway Patrol to Allow Bicycles to Treat Stop Signs and Red Lights as Yield Signs” was changed to “A Resolution in Support of Bicycle Safety” and passed in a 17-0-2 vote.</p>\n<p>During the Consent Calendar portion of the meeting, Constantino discussed and modified “A Bill to Increase Transparency and Oversight of Student Fees.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said he plans to add a portion to the bill saying failure to submit an annual fee report would result in disqualification.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should do that to have a bite in this policy. So with that, I would like to add in,” Constantino said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano, said he would like another week to review the details of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I’m not comfortable passing this today. I would want this tabled so I can do research,” Mariano said. “This is why, in Campus Affairs, I brought up the constitutionality of it.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year Asian American studies and political science double major said she agreed with Constantino.</p>\n<p>“I’m in support of this, but, just wondering, did you approach Judicial Council or the Attorney General about this?” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Constantino said he has not heard from Judicial Council or the Attorney General, which he believes indicates they have no issues with it.</p>\n<p>“I assume that they have no problems with it, because this is the most transparent bill I have ever seen this body put out,” Constantino said. “Jimmy [Villarreal, A.S. President] is the only person to reach out to me regarding this bill. I’ve made a website about it; there’s a comment page about it, and no one has made any comments about it.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said he thinks A.S. has the power to deny reaffirmation, but he is not positive.</p>\n<p>“The only issue seems to be whether or not we can stop groups from reaffirming their fee referendum, and that doesn’t seem to be an issue with Elections committee on the basis that they have turned down reaffirmations in the past,” Constantino said.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Increase Transparency and Oversight of Student Fees” was passed in a 14-5-0 vote.</p>\n<p>Also during the meeting, “A Resolution to Promote Feedback on the Association,” “A Resolution Endorsing the Educational Awareness of AB 1007” and “A Resolution Endorsing the Educational Awareness of Senate Bill 656”  were sent to External Affairs, “A Resolution to Create a Temporary Committee for University Lobby Day” was sent to Campus Affairs while “A Resolution To Promote a More Inclusive UCSB Campus” and “A Resolution to Create a Group Project to Create a Petition Service For AS” were tabled for a week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/a-s-senate-talks-bike-traffic-laws-political-transparency/","id":3962,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3961,3960,3959],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
