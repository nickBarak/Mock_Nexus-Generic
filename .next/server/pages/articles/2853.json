Positions to be filled include President, Internal Vice President (IVP), External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), Student Advocate General (SAG) and off-campus and on-campus senators.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major running for A.S. President with OPP Jimmy Villareal said one major project he was involved with last year was a general poll that allowed students to give input to A.S.</p>\n<p>“An effort that I was kind of a part of was the Associated Students strategic plan, and that was basically something I did last year,” Villareal said. “We took surveys from over 1,800 students, kind of asked them what they wanted to see from us, what does A.S. do well, what does A.S. not do well, how can we improve and what do they want to see from us in the future.”</p>\n<p>According to Villareal, his main goal is to anticipate and cater to the wants and needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what I want to focus on, is what kind of services we’re providing for the students, how can we take the services that we had already and make them better,” Villareal said. “How can we be more efficient with those, and how can we identify things that students really want, that we aren’t providing already, and find a way to do that and make it feasible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for A.S. President with FTP Jason Garshfield said he is running in order to provide students with an option to choose a candidate that is “a little closer to the average students and their wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>“I want the students to have a choice this year. I think it’s disappointing that there’s only one political party and I thought that to remedy that situation I would run,” Garshfield said. “I haven’t been building up my resume for three years and I think that makes me a unique candidate, as opposed to people who have been devoting themselves to A.S. and don’t really have any other interests.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, he would place greater importance on protecting students’ rights as opposed to forcing his agenda on them.</p>\n<p>“I think the changes that I implement would be a subtraction rather than addition because I think that ultimately my job as A.S. president is not to force my agenda on the students. My agenda is to protect the fundamental rights of the students and to treat everyone as an individual,” Garshfield said. “If that involves subtracting some things from the office and subtracting the power of the president, then I will definitely do whatever’s in my power to do so.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major running for IVP with OPP Kimia Hashemian said she wants to bring back a system called Gaucho Rewards in order to increase student participation at university and Isla Vista events.</p>\n<p>“It’s a program to increase attendance to the different events we have on campus,” Hashemian said. “Go to a sports game and get 50 points, if you go to town hall you get 100 points, and these points can be redeemed for cost-free things, such as going up Storke tower, or having lunch with the A.S. president, something like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major running for EVPLA with OPP Paola De La Cruz said her main focus would be to address issues concerning housing, sexual assault and community building on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am running because I want to improve the quality of life of students in Isla Vista, and really voice concerns and experiences that I went through,” De La Cruz said. “I really want to work towards creating some temporary housing on campus; then for sexual assault I want to develop and execute a campaign to battle sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for EVPLA with FTP Brandon Morse said medical marijuana dispensaries in I.V. could be beneficial in generating revenue for self-governance and other community-based purposes.</p>\n<p>“I think the one thing we’re missing out on is revenue streams as far as the cannabis industry,” Morse said. “I think that there are a substantial number of medical cannabis patients in the Isla Vista area, and the fact that we don’t have immediate safe access for patients is a travesty, and it is also something that we’re lacking as far as a potential revenue source to be able to support things like self-governance.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major running independently for EVPSA Mohsin Mirza said he hopes to address the issue that “the cost of school is going up while the quality is going down.”</p>\n<p>“I am running because we’re at a crossroads right now in higher education. The cost of school is going up but our quality is going down,” Mirza said. “As part of my platform I’ve got several things. The first is mobilize students against the tuition hike through educational actions leading to actions to put pressure on the governor to fund the UC’s more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major running as EVPSA with OPP Carlos Lopez said he wants to better inform students about student debt and budgeting to better involve students in discussions involving tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I did in my second year was I put on a weeklong event called the week of revenue. It talked about student debt, how student debt has risen in the last years, and a couple of things that we can try to fight the rising and tuition,” Lopez said. “So I’m hoping to have something every single quarter to try to engage students more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running independently for SAG Jorge Escobar said few people know about the SAG office, and publicizing their service would be one of his priorities.</p>\n<p>“The office of the Student Advocate General is relatively new, people don’t know us, but we’re a great resource on campus,” Escobar said. “One thing we want to work on is solidifying the office, making sure that we progress. We’re still learning, we want to be able to utilize our resources better.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major running independently for SAG Anais Zavala said the office gives advice and helps students with “anything that has to do with campus policies.”</p>\n<p>“If you get written up in the dorms, plagiarize, break a student code of conduct, we know what to refer you to or we can just give you advice on what to do,” Zavala said. “That’s something that I’m really familiar with, and I’d just like to let people know more about our office.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/","id":2853,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2852,2851,2850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun","biography":"Not available","articles":[2342,2590,2757,2768,2776,2777,2834,2853,2878,3455,4655,4700,4749,4785],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Academic Senate Lifts 2014 Freeze on CCS Lit Admissions","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Academic Senate has lifted a 2014 admissions freeze placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2015.

This article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate has lifted a <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/academic-senate-approves-suspension-of-admissions-to-ccs-literature-major/\">2014 admissions freeze</a> placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Admission to the program was suspended on a temporary basis last year by the Undergraduate Council over concerns regarding program leadership, lack of adequate involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty and an underdeveloped relationship with other campus departments.  The Senate approved the decision to lift the freeze by the Undergraduate Council at a meeting last week on Feb. 12.  The suspension of admissions did not affect the degree trajectories of students already enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>According to Undergraduate Council Executive Director Deborah Karoff, admission to the program was reinstated after the concerns leading to its suspension were addressed and resolved with efforts by multiple campus departments and faculty members.</p>\n<p>“The College of Creative Studies and several other departments on campus worked together to strengthen the involvement of Senate faculty in the program,” Karoff said.</p>\n<p>According to Karoff, it is a norm at the university that Senate-affiliated faculty participate in major programs of all the departments on campus. Karoff also said a number of individual Senate faculty and campus departments have made commitments to support the program in the future in a way sufficient enough to convince the Undergraduate Council to lift the freeze.</p>\n<p>Dean of CCS and professor of paleobiology Bruce Tiffney said the program suffered from lack of a “coherent curriculum” in place to develop foundational skills for literature students.</p>\n<p>“The program did not have a coherent curriculum put together that was allowing students to both clearly develop in their skills as both students of literature and of writing,” Tiffney said. “[The program] was not set up in a manner that would ensure that they would get out and be taking a range of courses outside and encountering these really wonderful faculty the campus has.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney said the decline of Senate-affiliated faculty over the years took place as part of a historical process of faculty engagement issues. He also mentioned that all other programs in CCS except literature have at least one Senate lecturer in their roster, which are faculty members in CCS and its equivalent academic department in the College of Letters and Science. According to Tiffney, a search is underway for a candidate to hold that dual position.</p>\n<p>“That individual will then be a core leader in the program … who has feet in both Letters and Science and CCS,” Tiffney said. “Now that this has been lifted, the is primary focus is to go and … can run a search.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney also said the CCS literature program historically has had a strong creative writing background in its instruction, but that other aspects of literary study were less prominent in the program. According to Tiffney, the program’s name may be changed to CCS Writing and Literature to reflect the greater breadth that comes with more faculty engagement as well as curricular changes. The curricular changes will reflect the increase of involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty as well as structural changes associated with the program’s foundational material.</p>\n<p>“In the past we did not have a set of courses that in essence built from the bottom up and developed a sense of knowledge from the campus of resources of expected areas of expertise,” Tiffney said. “What we are doing here — we did not have this before — would be a sequence of courses that would develop a background in literature … creative writing and then writing studies.”</p>\n<p>CCS literature instructor Angela Holzmeister said she is pleased the program will accept admissions for the coming academic year.</p>\n<p>“My experience teaching literature courses in CCS has been a tremendously gratifying one, due, not in the least, to the impressively intelligent students I’ve had the pleasure of working with this year,” Holzmeister said in an email. “These students are not only testimony to the quality of students admitted into CCS, but they are also the product of the education they receive at CCS.”</p>\n<p>The program will still undergo certain changes as it reopens for admissions, including unapproved curricular and name changes that will be considered at a March 12 meeting of the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>CCS literature alumnus and current Community Manager of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Tony Pierce said he was pleased with the change in fortune for the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m super relieved that the university has realized that they have a hidden flower patch in CCS Lit that should just be left alone to bloom,” Pierce said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in a statement that he is thankful to the various faculty and administrative officials who helped oversee the program’s return.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that … Dean Bruce Tiffney and his administrative colleagues have overseen a successful proposal to revitalize CCS’s literature program,” Yang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61388\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61388\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/academic-senate-lifts-2014-freeze-on-ccs-lit-admissions/","id":2850,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2849,2848,2847],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Talks i>Clicker Rental Updates, GE Modifications","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night at the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss resolutions regarding the support of curricular changes in general education, senators’ workload, devel...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61363\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61363\" data-attachment-id=\"61363\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/senate-talks-iclicker-rental-updates-ge-modifications/senate_lorenzo-basilio-1-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424890220\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate 2/25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61363\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"A.S.

Lopez said the <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/\">recent issuance of a letter of concern</a> from the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a setback in the progression of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“We passed our resolution last Wednesday and then the next day myself and a number of other senators went to the LAFCO meeting. We spoke with a lot of other students and a lot of homeowners, which is big because a lot of homeowners were not down with AB 3 at the beginning,” Lopez said. “We felt that they should not pass a letter of concern, but as it LAFCO’s way, they passed a letter of concern anyway.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the stakeholders group compiled a list of things they would like to see in the bill language for the CSD and voted to send it to the legislature for potential amendments to keep the bill in action.</p>\n<p>“We had our discussion to find out what is palatable for everyone, sent it in, and then that will be coming back to us hopefully after we have the financial sustainability report,” Lopez said. “Then we can put together the actual bill that will be discussed on the floor.”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini told the Senate about recent developments in her nascent student lobbying group. According to Mancini, the group plans to advocate on behalf of students politically and will be soliciting input from student groups.</p>\n<p>“We filled out a sheet with all the orgs we’re going to reach out to, and there’s quite a few of them, hopefully about 30,” Mancini said. “At our next meeting we’re going to identify our lobby targets so that’s going to be an important meeting.”</p>\n<p>Senators debated the Resolution Supporting the Establishment of a Gender and Sexuality GE Requirement, a resolution that would support additional graduation requirements regarding gender and sexuality courses.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he supports the resolution because it brings wider attention to less recognized courses.“There are classes that already cover these subject matters,” Lopez said. “[We should] just give them more recognition and … get majors that don’t usually deal with these sort of courses the opportunity to. The UC is something that should have more of a holistic education.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he supported the resolution but doubted the level of student support for the idea of advocacy for extra GE courses.</p>\n<p>“I like this resolution. I do want to point that not every student is cool with extra duties,” Villarreal said. “Since they come to school and want to get out of here and get a job and [are] not necessarily going to support extra GEs.”</p>\n<p>Senator and third-year political science and global studies major Kevin Koo said he supported the resolution and that the university’s progressive academic policies is part of his reason for doing so.</p>\n<p>“Universities are meant to grow and that’s the whole point of this,” Koo said. “It stands as a very good example of the generation that we’re in and that this is more and more a growing issue and that’s why I’m personally in favor of it.”</p>\n<p>Koo responded to Villarreal’s concerns about the lack of student support saying students would agree to the take the GE courses if they are presented as simply a regular part of the GE curriculum.</p>\n<p>“If they come in from the start knowing this is a GE, then everyone will just think that’s normal and it’s not like ‘Oh I have to do more work,’” Koo said. “It’s just gonna be ‘Oh yeah this is just part of the GE package.’”</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year student Haywood Hunter said he personally supports the resolution, but voted against it citing that his position is to be representative of all students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea, I would vote for it, but I represent a lot of students who would look at this as an attempt to increase units,” Hunter said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau gave a brief summary of an average senator’s workload to address her perception that the student public is not aware of how much work senators do.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned that people don’t know what you all do. So I had [Government Affairs advisor] Cory [Graves] help me put together a spreadsheet detailing out how many hours an average senator actually spends doing senate work,” Lau said. “This does not include any time you spent meeting with administrators, any time you spent going to local meetings, or group projects that you all have done.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, senators also spend a lot of time reading emails, preparing for meetings and reviewing previous meetings’ minutes.</p>\n<p>“I know you all get at least 20 emails a day because I get at least 120 emails a day, but I’m sure you each get at least 20 that are relatively important that you have to read,” Lau said. “You all have to read through bills and resolutions as well as all the minutes that are sent out from all the boards and commissions in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>Lau said it is important for senators to perform their duties on top of their schoolwork.</p>\n<p>“In total, at the very minimum, the average senator spends about 14.8 hours doing senate work,” Lau said. “So I just hope that everyone is aware of that and is aware that we are also students here.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli updated the senate on difficulties regarding the introduction of his <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/\">office’s i&gt;clicker rental program</a>. According to Khazaieli, technical issues with the website have prevented the online sign up process from being launched.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;clicker program ran into a little bit of a hiccup getting the website up because we were kind of busy with the whole server side of things,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said that if the issues continue, the office will need a backup plan to finish its program implementation efforts.</p>\n<p>“So if we’re not able to do an online rental kind of reservation thing, we’re going to have to either come up with some plan B or maybe ask for permission to allow us to do the website,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal updated the senate on the funding the Finance and Business Committee has provided to student groups this past academic year. According to Villarreal, A.S. has granted $419,497 to 253 campus groups as of week seven of Winter quarter.</p>\n<p>“Whenever we’re questioned about how effective Associated Students is or how we help the students out, that’s how,” Villarreal said. “We provide over $400,000 worth of funding to groups so that they can put on their events, whether big or small, here or on the other side of the country, and they’re representing UCSB and making UCSB a better school.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

id=\"caption-attachment-61714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Davidson Library hosted a panel discussion on prisoner re-entry into society on Wednesday as part of the UCSB Reads 2015 program, bringing together university affiliates and Santa Barbara residents to discuss Piper Kerman’s best-selling memoir <em>Orange is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison</em>.</p>\n<p>The three panelists<strong>, </strong>Sister Terry Dodge from Crossroads Inc., Billi Jo Starr from Freedom4Youth and Kristianne Clifford from the Freedom to Choose Foundation, explained the importance of helping prisoners, particularly women and children, re-enter civilian life after release from prison. The panelists shared stories from their years working for non-profits, emphasizing the methods their organizations use to help prisoners through the re-entry process.</p>\n<p>Dodge founded Crossroads Inc., a non-profit organization providing support to incarcerated women, and said female prisoners should not be defined by crimes they commit.</p>\n<p>“We are more than our worse mistake,” Dodge said. “There’s much more to us. People need the opportunity to make change within their life and I think as a community we need to be willing to accept them, [and] allow that change to happen to welcome them back into the community.”</p>\n<p>Starr co-founded Freedom4Youth, a non-profit organization working with incarcerated youth, and said organizations like hers provide necessary skills and support to empower incarcerated youth and help them overcome their traumatic upbringings.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is hurt people, hurt people,” Starr said. “There hasn’t been one boy or girl that’s come in and said ‘Life is so great, I’ve had it easy and I just decided I was going to steal a car one day.’ It’s always something traumatic in the youths’ lives and that trauma has impacted them in a variety of ways … that has fractured their soul. It’s really about taking that fracture and helping and empowering them to repair it on their own.”</p>\n<p>Starr said the most important thing Freedom4Youth does is work with troubled youth through direct consultation without judgment or expectation.</p>\n<p>“We just see them for who they are and we see the best in them and we listen to them,” Starr said. “Overall that’s one of the greatest gifts that you could give to someone, because by listening to them, then they’ll come to their own conclusions. They’ll realize their own dreams. And we just provide that vehicle for them and support them.”</p>\n<p>Clifford works with Freedom to Choose Foundation, a non-profit organization offering education workshops to California inmates on personal responsibility, and said she hopes her adolescent stint in prison will help her reach out to people in similar situations.</p>\n<p>“It’s about instilling hope and meeting people where they are at,” Clifford said. “I was in prison when my father died, when I was twelve … I’m grateful for my experience because I have a purpose in life and hopefully I can educate people and make myself vulnerable to others to ask me questions.”</p>\n<p>Clifford said the Freedom to Choose Foundation changed her life by helping her deal with personal issues involving self-judgment.</p>\n<p>“A lot of my change came when I stopped judging my feelings and myself as good or bad,” Clifford said. “Not being good enough or not measuring up or fitting in. When I stopped judging those feelings and I started just being present, it changed everything and I stopped judging others. And I put aside the expectations that I had on others.”</p>\n<p>Starr said she also relates to the “at risk” youth she works with in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I was that at-risk youth … we grew up in a trailer park … my mom was a teenage mom. I never thought of college or a future, and so I have an understanding of where the youth that I work with come from,” Starr said.</p>\n<p>According to Starr, strong supportive mentors in her life helped her realize her worth amidst adversity.</p>\n<p>“[They] helped me realize, ‘Hey I have a choice. I don’t have to go down the same road that my parents went down and I can make different choices and I’m worth it,’” Starr said.</p>\n<p>Dodge said more people need to get involved in helping recently released prisoners re-enter society.</p>\n<p>“People think the work that I do is extraordinary. I don’t,” Dodge said. “It seems extraordinary to people because there’s not enough people doing it.”</p>\n<p>Assistant University Librarian for Outreach and Academic Collaboration Rebecca Metzger said events like the prisoner re-entry panel are vital to present to students because it brings new perspectives on life outside university.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes at a university it can be kind of a closed environment where you don’t hear a lot about the experiences of the people outside the walls of the university,” Metzger said. “So with this program we were trying to bring those voices in and create a space to have conversations.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Rachel Dahan said she found the panel discussion to be “empowering” because of its wide relatability.</p>\n<p>“It is relatable for everyone,” Dahan. “We can’t just say ‘They are other people’ or that ‘It doesn’t matter because it’s not my fault they should be punished’ because they are people and this is a very important issue.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61707\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/ucsb-reads-talk-focuses-on-re-entry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61707\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/ucsb-reads-talk-focuses-on-re-entry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/ucsb-reads-talk-focuses-on-re-entry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/ucsb-reads-talk-focuses-on-re-entry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/ucsb-reads-talk-focuses-on-re-entry/","id":2852,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2851,2850,2849],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
