A defense official told CNN the test would involve firing an improved Standard Missile, which has reportedly only been tested once. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The modifications include an upgraded booster and warhead for longer firing ranges, supposedly farther from the coastline of North Korea, and a greater chance of shooting down an incoming projectile. The program, aimed at intercepting North Korean intermediate-range missiles targeting Japan, is being </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">developed in conjunction with the Pacific ally, according to CNN.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another test, to be conducted toward the end of May in the Pacific region, will use long-range, ground-based interceptor missiles in Alaska and California to check the the U.S.’s ability to shoot down an intercontinental ballistic missile from North Korea, CNN reported. The Department of Defense told CNN approximately half the tests from the program have succeeded within its over decade-long existence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a recent report by the Department of Defense, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system “has demonstrated a limited capability to defend the U.S. Homeland from small numbers of simple intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea or Iran.” The report added it couldn’t quantitatively evaluate GMD efficiency, citing a lack of accredited ground tests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A defense official told CNN the Pentagon has been reviewing its military options for over a month in the event that the White House decides to take military action against North Korea. The U.S. is not presently considering preemptive military action, according to the official. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN reported the review is part of a broader National Security Council survey of options to approach North Korea, which include diplomatic and economic considerations. The options also include updating current analysis on North Korea’s potential response to hypothetical U.S. military action and ensuring military assets are in place if the occasion calls for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The official told CNN the ongoing activity doesn’t change the administration’s and the Pentagon’s desire for a diplomatic solution, with military and civilian Pentagon officials “thinking through every course of action.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-25/pentagon-to-launch-missile-from-nearby-air-force-base-in-may/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-25/pentagon-to-launch-missile-from-nearby-air-force-base-in-may/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-25/pentagon-to-launch-missile-from-nearby-air-force-base-in-may/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-25/pentagon-to-launch-missile-from-nearby-air-force-base-in-may/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-25/pentagon-to-launch-missile-from-nearby-air-force-base-in-may/","id":3921,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[3920,3919,3918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"From Environment to Education, Calif.

county residents, now holds 82,011 acre-feet of water — a significant increase from the 34,576 acre-feet it held last Wednesday. This still accounts for less than half of the lake’s maximum storage: 193,305 acre-feet.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Flood Control District reported that the lake was at 17.9 percent capacity last week and at 7.3 percent capacity on Oct. 1 of last year.</p>\n<p>In light of the six-year statewide drought, the United States Bureau of Reclamation said in October 2015 that the Goleta Water District should “expect no new water from the lake.”</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District declared mandatory water use restrictions in May 2015 when it declared a Stage III Water Shortage Emergency with plans to reduce water usage by 35 percent across the district.</p>\n<p>This type of emergency is declared when the district’s water supply is 65 to 75 percent what it should normally be at that time of the year.</p>\n<p>Drought conditions may improve with recent rainfall, as Santa Barbara County is among the regions most affected by the recent drought period.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are the only areas still in an extreme drought stage, referred to as D3. The rest of the state is mostly in abnormally dry conditions, D0, with a large portion of Northern California no longer in drought.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Santa Barbara County could be lifted out of D3 range after last week’s rain spells.</p>\n<p>While the rain could offset the county’s drought, it also may cause potential infrastructure problems, as last week’s storm resulted in sinkholes, mudslides and severe flooding.</p>\n<p>Tom Fayram, deputy director of Water Resources at the Public Works Department in the county, said he is not concerned about the infrastructure at Cachuma Dam but recognized that last week’s intense rain could cause problems for roadways and flood control systems.</p>\n<p>“I have no concern over Cachuma Dam,” Fayram said. “If we get future rainfall of the magnitude of the rain we got just before last weekend, then we do have serious infrastructure concerns in terms of our transportation system, our roadways, our flood control system, [and] in terms of our channels and basins that do tend to be stressed in storms like that.”</p>\n<p>Fayram, whose department works in contracting the water from Lake Cachuma, said last week’s rains greatly contributed to the reservoir’s water supply, which will provide water to the entire south coast including Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We still don’t know yet how much water actually will be available out of this,” Fayram said.  “There [are] a number of factors that go into it, but clearly this was a welcome shot in the arm, so to speak, of water that we just haven’t seen for the last five years.”</p>\n<p>As for how this rainfall will affect water restrictions in Goleta, KK Holland from the Goleta Water District said she is “cautiously optimistic” given the recent storm activity.</p>\n<p>“The Board is not currently considering additional restrictions,” Holland said in an email.<br>\nFayram said he welcomes the rain and capacity increase, but long-term solutions are necessary to solve the drought problem.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lake that’s at 50 percent capacity and can go back down to the same conditions we were in before,” Fayram said. “I don’t think that even filling the lake completely would solve our water supply issues because we started off with a lake in 2011 completely full, and five years of drought put us into a very dire situation.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75953\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75953\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/","id":3920,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3919,3918,3917],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
