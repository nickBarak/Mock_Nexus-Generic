For a team with nine underclassmen, that’s a big deal.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have a chance to showcase its continued development and maybe pick up a couple wins this weekend. Santa Barbara will play host to UC Irvine on Friday and then UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night during its final home matches of the season.</p>\n<p>The two consecutive losses have knocked the Gauchos (6-17, 5-6) down to fifth in the Big West standings, directly behind the two teams they’ll play this weekend. Just two wins in the Thunderdome, and UCSB will likely find itself back in the top half of the conference.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine (21-4, 9-3) sits in third place in the Big West, three and a half games ahead of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Five Anteaters have triple-digit kills so far this season, but no attacker has more than 300. It’s a balanced attack, coordinated primarily by junior setter Ali Koumelis and her 883 assists.</p>\n<p>“I expect to see a diverse and balanced offense,” Lantagne Welch said. “They have been getting solid production across the board with their experienced outside, their lefty right-side, and they have a really quick attacking middle.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has won its last two games, both 3-0 decisions, against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. Three games back from Cal Poly, the Anteaters have an outside chance of grabbing a conference championship but must first find a way to overcome the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following Friday, UC Davis comes to town for UCSB’s Senior Night. The Aggies are 15-11 overall and 7-6 in the Big West, directly above the Gauchos.<br>\nUCSB took down the Aggies while on the road back on Oct. 17, but that was a different UC Davis team. UCD has won its last four matches and will look to give Cal Poly its first conference loss the night before it visits Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We can take the things we did well [in the first match against UCD], the confidence that we prevailed and, of course, the things that were a little off to improve this time around,” Lantagne Welch said. “Davis is a better team this time around, but definitely we are better now, too.”</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s match will be preceded by a Senior Night ceremony for UCSB’s two seniors, defensive specialist Sydney Bast and outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Bast and Hoffman have served as the Gauchos’ veterans throughout this up-and-down season and earned high praise from their head coach.</p>\n<p>“Chanel and Syd are first, and most importantly, great people,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are people you just want to be around. They are my first two recruits ever here at UCSB and have embraced their roles as leaders on this team. They speak up and share experiences and bring extra to the team every day. They truly put the team before themselves, and it has helped the team all year long.”</p>\n<p>Playing in their last-ever home matches as Gauchos, Bast and Hoffman will be motivated to finish strong. Their teammates will be similarly motivated to send their seniors out on top, which could prove to be key on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The team will want to give everything they have for Chanel and Syd,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are a huge part of this program and you just want to put everything out on the floor for them.”<br>\nThe underclassmen have been the focus of this season, but it is those preparing to end their time as Gauchos who will have the spotlight this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UCI Friday, Nov. 10, and UC Davis Saturday, Nov. 11. Both matches will take place at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/","id":4962,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4961,4960,4959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault","biography":"Not available","articles":[11,39,40,146,167,173,205,236,306,308,309,317,765,767,825,947,951,973,1000,1187,1188,1189,1190,1192,1194,1224,1226,1364,1897,1906,3349,3358,3418,3419,3421,3422,4835,4838,4839,4851,4859,4863,4865,4867,4871,4886,4935,4953,4955,4956,4957,4958,4959,4960,4961,4962,4966,4967,4972,4973,4974,4975,4976,4977,4979,4980,4983,4985,4986,4990,4992,5004,5005,5006,5008,5009,5560,5565,5569,5572,5573,5577,5578],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Three-Game Win Streak Ended by Rainbow Wahine in Four-Set Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-prev.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-prev.jpg?resize=682%2C546&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to an even 5-5 record in conference play following its second loss of the season to Hawaii in four sets.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There’s little room for error against good teams and the UCSB women’s volleyball team learned that lesson the hard way Saturday evening in Rob Gym, as they fell to Hawaii in four sets (25-20, 25-22, 19-25, 25-17) thanks to some slow starts and defensive breakdowns.</p>\n<p>The loss killed the Gauchos three-game winning streak it carried into the match and dropped them to 6-16 overall, 5-5 in the Big West.

Annie Hasselmann and Charlie Robinson had two aces apiece, and the team as a whole never let the Rainbow Wahine make things interesting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79359\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wvball-vshawaii-171028-dustinharris-05-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79359\" data-attachment-id=\"79359\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/wvball-vshawaii-171028-dustinharris-05-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1366%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1366,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79359\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=278%2C417\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79359\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Charlie Robinson swipes the ball across the opponents block. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I thought the second and third sets we played really well,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said after the game. “We hit over 20 percent in both those sets and we put ourselves in a position to win. That’s when we started rolling.”</p>\n<p>In the next set, however, Hawaii returned the favor. The visitors came flying out of the gates and took the first seven points of the set, pushing the Gauchos onto their heels from the outset.</p>\n<p>The onslaught continued mostly unabated for a while, as the Rainbow Wahine ran out to a 16-3 lead thanks to a barrage of kills. UCSB managed to stem the flow of blood at that point, and mus red two separate five-point runs to close the gap a little bit, but the deficit was ultimately too large to overcome.</p>\n<p>“Volleyball is a funny game, it comes in waves,” Nicole Welch said. “We were just a little rough early and we had to steady out. You’d think you’d be ready and fired up, but it was just a bit off to start the match.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii managed to hit above 20 percent in all four matches, a major contributing factor to their win on Saturday. Sophomore McKenna Granato led the Rainbow Wahine attack with 21 kills, a typical result for the standout outside hitter, and added 17 digs for a solid double-double.</p>\n<p>“Probably our biggest disappointment (Saturday) was our defensive effort,” Welch said. “That’s been really strong the last week or so and we really didn’t do a good job. We weren’t following our scouting report like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense might not have been clicking the way Welch wished, but the team’s service game was almost impeccable. UCSB had a season-high 14 kills, with Hasselmann’s six leading the way.</p>\n<p>“(Hawaii) has a really good middle, so part of our strategy was if we get them out of system, we don’t have to deal with her,” Welch said. “Obviously we wanted to serve aggressively and we were going to be okay with a few errors if we went at them really hard.”</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins led all players Saturday with 23 kills, and the redshirt sophomore chipped in 16 blocks as well for a double-double of her own. It was an excellent performance by any measure for the outside hitter, but one that the reigning National and Big West Player of the Week has managed to make almost ho-hum, a testament to her season-long run of dominance.</p>\n<p>Outside hitter Chloe Allen, who missed eight matches with an injury in the middle of the season, seemed back to full form Saturday evening. The sophomore posted 16 kills, her second-highest total of the season, and provided the Gauchos with a formidable second weapon.</p>\n<p>“Chloe struggled the last week and she really came to life (Saturday),” Welch said. “That’s important for our team, and for our team moving forward, so that was a great plus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next match is versus Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, November 3 in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/","id":4959,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4958,4957,4956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Drop Four-Set Match Against Rival No. 24 Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Saturday’s loss was the Gauchos’ fourth in a row, all in Big West play, dropping the team to 3-15 overall and 2-4 in conference play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Saturday evening’s match against No. 24 Cal Poly started well enough for the UCSB women’s volleyball team.</p>\n<p>“We passed well enough to win this match, we served aggressively, and our blocks started out strong.

Cal Poly won the first point on a Savannah Niemen kill after an extended rally featuring several saves for both sides.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs charged out to an early lead thanks to a couple UCSB errors but returned the favor with three of their own in short order. Lindsey Ruddins put the Gauchos ahead 15-14 with a powerful kill off an assist from setter Emilia Petrachi, but Cal Poly didn’t go quietly.</p>\n<p>The two teams traded kills back and forth for the next few minutes, although UCSB was able to build a 22-19 lead, putting themselves at the doorstep of a surprise first-set victory.</p>\n<p>Two kills from Torrey Van Winden and another from Raeann Greisen evened things back up, however, putting the heat back on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Neither team was able to build the requisite two-point advantage, instead of exchanging kills as they pushed past the 25-point mark. Star outside hitter Ruddins contributed a handful of kills, while setter Annie Hasselmann caught the Mustangs off guard with a surprise spike to give UCSB a 26-25 lead.</p>\n<p>Torrey Van Winden once again tied the set up after Hasselmann’s kill with one of her own, but the ensuing Ruddins kill pushed the Gauchos out ahead once again. Van Winden responded with an attack error, securing a 28-26 set victory for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Hyped up on their strong start against likely the best team they’ll play all season, the Gauchos jumped out to a 7-5 lead in the second set. That’s when the Mustangs woke up. Cal Poly won the next 13 points, and eventually pulled out a 25-15 set victory.</p>\n<p>The third set looked remarkably similar to the second. UCSB led 4-3 early, but then watched the Mustangs run off the next nine points. The rest of the set was fairly back and forth, but that was all Cal Poly needed to coast to a 25-16 victory.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final set didn’t have a similar Cal Poly run, but the result was largely the same as the prior two sets. Rather than ride a sudden explosion to victory, the Mustangs simply wore the Gauchos down on their way to a 25-15 clinching win.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, as has been the case throughout the season, led UCSB in kills with 21, the only Gaucho in double digits. Hasselmann set up the bulk of those kills, finishing with 31 assists.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s sibling duo of Torrey and Adlee Van Winden proved to be too much Van Winden for UCSB to handle. The sisters combined for 39 kills, 21 for Torrey and 18 for Adlee, who had seven blocks as well.</p>\n<p>No other Mustang cracked 10 kills, although setter Taylor Nelson did post a double-double of 47 assists and 10 digs.

We are putting the effort in and now we just want to execute.”</p>\n<p>UCSB must now turn its attention to UC Davis, as the Gauchos travel to Davis to take on the 11-9, 3-4 Aggies for the first time this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-15/chos-drop-four-set-match-against-rival-no-24-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-15/chos-drop-four-set-match-against-rival-no-24-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-15/chos-drop-four-set-match-against-rival-no-24-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-15/chos-drop-four-set-match-against-rival-no-24-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-15/chos-drop-four-set-match-against-rival-no-24-cal-poly/","id":4960,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4959,4958,4957],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Fall Short in Mustang Territory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This season's second installment of the Blue-Green rivalry ended with UCSB experiencing some inconsistencies while on the road.

UCSB led 19-15 late in the first set, but the Mustangs (22-2, 12-0) snatched what would have been a crucial victory away with a 12-6 run, winning the set 27-25 in extra points.</p>\n<p>Stung by the painful first-set defeat, the Gauchos flew out of the gate again in the second set with an 8-1 run. Cal Poly once again battled back, closing the gap at 17-17 and later took a 24-21 lead with a chance to win the set and likely control the match.</p>\n<p>Three straight Gaucho points staved off a potential second set loss, however, and another three-point run a little later was capped off with a Lindsey Ruddins kill that allowed UCSB to knot the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, as usual, was the Gauchos’ leading attacker. The sophomore outside hitter posted 26 kills, and added nine digs and four blocks to balance out her statline.</p>\n<p>The final two sets of the matchup were about as tight as the first two. They just didn’t happen to work in UCSB’s favor either time.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a late 19-18 lead after seesawing back and forth with the Mustangs for most of the third set, but that was as good as it got for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly took the next five points in a row, mostly on attack errors by UCSB, and finally won the set 25-21 to crack open a 2-1 lead in the match.</p>\n<p>That third set was the Gauchos’ worst offensively. They hit a match-low .189 for 14 kills. Their late errors were what allowed Cal Poly to surge late, a disappointing result for UCSB after leading for most of the set.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the fourth set looked remarkably similar to the first and third sets. Just as in those earlier periods, the Mustangs won on the strength of a scoring stretch after the Gauchos started hot.</p>\n<p>This time around, UCSB didn’t trail until a Raeann Greisen kill gave Cal Poly a 15-14 lead. Once the Mustangs had the lead, they didn’t give it back up.</p>\n<p>A five-point run pushed the hosts out to a 23-16 lead, large enough to sweat out the Gauchos’ 7-2 run to close out the set and take the match.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best on the attack, as they hit .289 and posted 16 kills. Cal Poly just happened to be better, with a hitting percentage of .366 and 19 kills.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson was second on UCSB with 12 kills, her best attacking effort since the team’s Sept. 29 match against CSUN. Robinson’s five total blocks was a team-best, just ahead of freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe and Annie Hasselmann.</p>\n<p>Hasselmann, as UCSB’s setter, had one of her best games of the season. The junior had 54 assists and nine digs to go with her four total blocks.</p>\n<p>Four different Mustangs finished with more than ten kills, a balanced attack that UCSB was simply unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>Torrey Van Winden was the leader with 20 kills, but her sister Adlee was close behind with 13 of her own, giving the family a very strong night on the attack.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home this coming weekend with two games in the Thunderdome at 7 pm, the first against UC Irvine on Friday and the second against UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-06/womens-volleyball-fall-short-in-mustang-territory/","id":4961,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4960,4959,4958],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
