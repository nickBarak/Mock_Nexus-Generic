The marquee announced it in big red letters. The band, led by singer and guitarist Isaac Brock, had their heyday in the mid-2000s, but their pull was still strong enough to draw a pretty jazzed crowd that night. There are a lot of people in their thirties trying to look like people in their twenties; the phrase I’ve decided on is Uncle Hipster. This means trimmed beards and flannel for the fellas, t-shirts and jeans for the ladies. Some leather, not much. Tattoos, if extant, are concealed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the marquee, people are clumped in twos and threes, taking pictures. I head over to the merch table, intent on spending money. T-shirts and hoodies are up on the wall. The designs are pretty weird, especially the one I end up getting: a deep blue t-shirt with a buck staring out of the center, neck and body mirrored left and right. MODEST MOUSE glows in green, blue and pink lettering which, combined with the neo-’80s typeface and mirrored deer, results in a sort of confetti psychedelia. That same shirt is everywhere inside, stretched over chests and peeking under hoodies. At what frequency does a faux-pas cease to be a faux-pas? I stash my shirt under-arm and head to my seat, where I sit until the openers come on around eight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re called Mimicking Birds, a soothing, toothless indie-folk group. They play an hour of decently groovy stuff over blue and sea-green light. The singer thanks us and thanks us again for being there. Everyone claps indulgently. Mimicking Birds leave, and the shapes of the stage crew materialize on stage, testing wires and mics. The stage is dark for 20 minutes. Then the maintenance shapes leave and other, better-dressed shapes emerge, picking up guitars, twirling drumsticks. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd cheers and claps. The stage lights up. Modest Mouse opens with “Ocean Breathes Salty,” a hit from their 2004 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good News For People Who Love Bad News.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Brock’s ironic, tongue-in-cheek presence surfaces in his banter and inter-song musings. A recurring concern is the hot sauce that he swears stings his eyes. “I had a taco earlier,” he explains, “with the hot sauce, and then I rubbed my eyes.” Someone brings him a towel several songs in, and he stands on stage dabbing his eyes with it. We cheer encouragingly. He goes on to perform a spirited, idiosyncratic show, though the towel makes several more appearances before the night is out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They played a mix of earlier cuts and later hits, including “Dashboard,” “Missed the Boat,” “Fire It Up,” and “The World at Large.” A lot of Modest Mouse’s stuff is nautical-sounding (especially their 2007 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), possibly inspired by Brock’s house flooding three times in his teens. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983586179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83338\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83341\" data-attachment-id=\"83341\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/dfx_3060/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DFX_3060\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83341\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their sound is a bit punk: catchy, shouty, angry, fun. Brock’s delivery defines their sound — his voice is somewhere between a yelp and a howl, conversational one second and guttural the next. Johnny Marr brought jangly guitar arrangements to their ’04 and ’07 albums, and the effect is propulsive and buoyant. The lights that night were cool, dynamic and synchronized snugly with the rhythm. A good mix of motion, color and strobe-y effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspicuously absent, however, was the band’s 2004 mega-hit, “Float On.” If you know one song by Modest Mouse, it’s that one. Brock’s decision not to play their biggest hit was disappointing at first, but, upon further thought, made more sense than the alternative, considering his abundantly weird stage presence and, judging by his interviews, presence in general. (One album promo features a mustached Brock interrogating a neck-braced Brock, who consults the lawyer beside him when asked questions like “Who are the members of your band?”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halfway through the show, Brock asks us how we’re doing tonight. We cheer, as audiences do. Brock looks disappointed. “Now,” he says, “when I ask you how you’re doing tonight, I want you to remain totally silent. It’ll be uncomfortable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hush develops as the crowd tries to figure out why he isn’t playing “Float On.” People look around. Some clap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are you doing tonight?!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scattered, defiant cheers. Brock, unfazed, repeats his question. “How are you doing tonight?” Most obey this time, not saying anything, except for some dudes a couple rows up. In their Aviators and OCBDs, they whoop-whoop into the silence of the theater. The moment’s over. Isaac Brock says, “This is turning into a different experiment than the one I’d envisioned.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

abundance of glimmering lights and filled by a majority of middle-aged fans, the Santa Barbara Bowl was blessed with an outrageously effervescent performance by LCD Soundsystem. Despite likely having outgrown the post-punk sound that influenced the early releases of LCD Soundsystem’s music, those in attendance did not fail to immerse themselves in the show.</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the legendary, genre-bending group made a stop at the SB Bowl to put on a life-altering performance. LCD Soundsystem proved to continue maintaining a legacy which has earned itself a victory lap once it comes to a gut-wrenching end.</p>\n<p>Prior to LCD Soundsystem gracing the stage, electronic duo Poolside kept the rhythm up for the few in attendance during the event’s beginning moments. A large disco ball hovered graciously above the stage, which suited the performance — Poolside labels their music as “Daytime Disco.” But as the sun began to set and the clock on the edge of the stage ticked, the audience became more and more anxious for LCD Soundsystem’s appearance. The groovy ballads could not contain the excitement lingering through everyone waiting.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lights dimmed and frontman James Murphy approached the mic, accompanied by his seven bandmates, and thus, the mayhem commenced. As he stood there intensely, clad in messy scruff, unkempt hair, suit jacket and all, bodies swarmed and Murphy prepared to make the stadium his playhouse.</p>\n<p>The band prepped the audience with an opening performance of “Yr City’s A Sucker,” a song which on the surface could pass as a track that is too downtempo to be an opener. LCD Soundsystem proved otherwise. And they continued to do so with each song, progressively captivating those in attendance more and more.</p>\n<p>“Get your drinks from the beer garden and get the hell over here!” Murphy yelled at the crowd testing them as if to see whether or not they were up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Throughout the show, each song was more enticing than the last. The grandeur of their discography is remarkable as is, yet they managed to elevate each song to completely new levels by putting on phenomenal live rhythms. With a career that has endured since 2002, the years can reflect in one of two ways: the time can take a toll or their experience makes their performance even more efficient. Luckily, the latter seems to be the case. Murphy is relentless in his delivery, and with the support of immaculate instrumentals, his voice is carried swiftly through crowds. The impact of his vocals vibrated the audience and the slick guitar riffs intertwined with jam-packed drums to induce a head-bobbing atmosphere which resonated throughout the venue.</p>\n<p>The presentation of LCD Soundsystem’s live display was mesmerizing. With each thump from the drums and each wave from the synth, a different colored light shot from the massive hovering disco ball out into the crowd and all over the trees. The backdrop was dreamlike, switching from a sheet of red to galactic patterns, both outlining Murphy’s silhouette perfectly. Coupled with ultra-danceable instrumentation, the beams of light created a fascinating atmosphere, overlaying the crowd’s lively, spirited fist pumps.</p>\n<p>Up until a brief pause between two of their songs, nothing interrupted their elegant transition from track to track. This break was only made in order for Murphy to inform the crowd that the band would stop for a bathroom break very soon. “Don’t worry we’ll come back,” he said. “No need for all the encore chants.”</p>\n<p>Aside from this, the only other time that their seamlessly pinpointed performance paused was for Murphy to announce the rest of the members’ names. He went through in an orderly fashion, naming off Tyler Pope, Pat Mahoney, Nancy Whang, Korey Richey, Matt Thornley, Gavin Rayna Russom and Al Doyle.</p>\n<p>Shiny lights glistened as Murphy’s powerful voice sorrowfully begged in deep cut “I Can Change” off of <em>This Is Happening.</em> The crowd burst as Murphy bellowed, “We won’t be your babies anymore / We won’t be your babies ’til you take us home” during “You Wanted A Hit,” and they welcomed electrifying guitar riffs. In these moments, I could not help but realize how overlooked Murphy’s vocals are.</p>\n<p>LCD Soundsystem played a number of songs, flipping through the plethora of hits which they have created. The band tapped into some of the new contemporary highlights from their catalog such as “I Used To” and “Tonite” from <em>American Dream</em>, in which Murphy’s voice continued to pierce through the bodies that stood in amazement. “Get Innocuous!” from <em>Sound Of Silver </em>was a standout moment. The live interpretation of this song was enthralling as Whang chanted, “You can normalize. Don’t it make you feel alive?” and lights flashed on and off. When the stadium turned black for almost a split second, one could feel the intensity of the crowd’s desire for more.</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, LCD Soundsystem had proven that my expectations paled in comparison to what was to come. A wonderful setting with incredible music was the perfect combination. At the SB Bowl, the stakes weren’t high for an audience filled with fans, but Murphy remained consistent and demonstrated the mastery which deems LCD Soundsystem as a legendary band — proving that they can probably do this forever.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83046\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83046\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/lcd-soundsystem-shines-at-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6644,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6643,6642,6641],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Pride Month Bangers","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-06-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rainbow-149485_640.png?resize=640%2C320&ssl=1","description":"Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, June. The beautiful summer month in which corporate logos begin their annual wardrobe change from monochrome mundaneness to rainbow realness. While in recent years corporations have welcomed Pride Month and inclusion with open arms, Pride marches and movements stem from a history of struggle, as queer people battled for representation and acceptance in all arenas of life. While many battles may appear to be definitively won, recent moves by the current presidential administration to stifle LGBTQ+ rights signal the ever-growing importance of Pride Month and LGBTQ+ representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how many rainbow scarves Tony the Tiger wears, the spirit of inclusion, self-acceptance and equality that Pride represents will remain important. Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams. In honor of the month of the Gays, below is a definitive list of new and old Pride Month Bangers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. “Bloom”- Troye Sivan</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troye Sivan, the sweet prince of pop, has been delivering danceable summer jams since his early days as a teen Youtuber. His 2015 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighbourhood </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gave us his first exploration of queer identity as a coming-to-age and coming out album, in which he explored the struggles of discovering and shaping one’s identity. However, “Bloom,” the title track off his upcoming album, finds a much more confident and self-assured Sivan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright pop song follows Sivan into a field of flower fueled metaphors, allusions and innuendos as he tackles the previously unexplored and unmentionable topic of gay sex. His sweet melodies and smooth voice take listeners on an intimate yet euphoric journey on a topic which has previously been ushered into the shadows. A music video, which matches the bright, colorful vibe of the track, explores both Sivan’s masculinity and femininity and questions the lines drawn between the two. The song and video shine the vibrant hues of Pride by turning a fun dance track into a vehicle for representation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41PTANtZFW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pynk (feat. Grimes)” – Janelle Monae</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monae, a multifaceted talent, has been nominated for Grammys, has appeared in Oscar-winning films and has been deemed a fashion icon. Her decision to come out as openly pansexual this year on her album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirty Computer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allows her to add “LGBTQ+ Icon” to that impressive list. Monae’s confident attitude and charismatic charm endows each track of the album with energy. However, “Pynk”’s artful celebration of the female existence seems especially important after Monae’s recent powerful statement of truth. Monae, a protégé of the purple man, Prince, finds her own color by imbuing pink as the color of feminine sexuality, power and desire. The romantic song manages to sound both upbeat and tender as Monae expresses desire and appreciation for women. Monae’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics create a playful dimension to this feminine, queer anthem. The song’s video, which features Monae and backup dancers dressed in what can only be described as “vagina pants,” perfectly accompanies the song’s sweet, funky vibes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaYvlVR_BEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Supermodel” – RuPaul</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before RuPaul had “Drag Race” glued to his last name and an entire empire, he was simply America’s most famous drag queen. Oh, yeah, and a bigtime recording artist. “Supermodel,” one of the most-fun songs ever to be recorded, imbues joy into the ears of anyone who hears its banging beat. As RuPaul commands his listeners to, “Work it, covergirl,” “Give us a twirl” and “Do your thing on the runway,” his listeners actually transform into runway models, equipped with fierce poses and sickening faces. After listening to this song maybe 500 times this month, the Hadids better watch out because this writer is ready for his Vogue debut. The song preaches the same self-acceptance and confidence which the ever popular reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” evokes in its viewers, allowing Supermodel to be a Pride Month dancefloor staple. This irresistible track captures the energy, confidence and love Pride pushes forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vw9LOrHU8JI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>4. “Chanel” – Frank Ocean</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2012, Frank Ocean became the first openly-gay major hip hop artist after he released his landmark album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channel Orange</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While Ocean’s dreamy, velvety vocals launched him into musical stardom, his idiosyncratic lyrics have pushed him among contemporary legends. On “Chanel,” a single from 2017, Ocean is in top form, delivering verse after verse that challenges and questions societal norms of gender, sexuality and success. Ocean’s lines flow and build upon each other, creating layers of meaning culminating in heart-wrenching croons. Ocean “sees both sides like Chanel,” and can “see on both sides like Chanel,” referencing both the fashion brand’s crossed “C” logo and his appreciation for his lover’s feminine and masculine sides. The quality of art delivered by Ocean makes him the queer icon we need and deserve. Chanel gives us an opportunity to appreciate all of Ocean’s talents, and that’s something we can all be proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnbsIl2BnWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>5. “I Don’t Want It at All” – Kim Petras</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Petras’ sugary-pop sound can only be described as a lollipop covered completely in Fun Dip. On her breakthrough single, “I Don’t Want It at All</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Petras is at maximum exuberance demanding — not asking — for all her wants and needs to be answered. If not delivered with Petras’ signature sweet and fun charisma, the song could sound flat and shallow. But with Petras in the driver’s seat, the song steers into the lane of colorful pop perfection. Petras first launched into international awareness as a young German teen fighting the German government for the right to receive sex reassignment surgery. After becoming the youngest person to ever undergo the surgery, Petras began writing songs and pursuing her dream of pop stardom. Petras’ mastery of pop signals that being trans and a popstar are not mutually exclusive.

Nevertheless, the two 19-year-olds have collaborated and delivered the five-track EP, <em>Crush. </em>On <em>Crush, </em>Lenae and Lacy, on the cusp of adulthood, come together to deliver an unorthodox yet soulful EP filled with a desire to remember past lovers and to feel wanted.</p>\n<p>Despite being young, the phenomenal duo have each had their fair share of experiences in the music industry. Lacy, a star from the band The Internet has ingrained his funky, tight beats into the ears of Kendrick Lamar listeners with his production on the inimitable track, “LUST” from Lamar’s <em>DAMN</em>. When he is not busy making beats on his iPhone, Lacy can also be heard accompanying artists such as Tyler, The Creator or Goldink, laying out some passionate vocals on songs like “911/Mr. Lonely” or “Some Girl.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lenae has released two EPs prior to <em>Crush</em>. On each she takes similar approaches to some funky instrumentals as she does on her project with Lacy. Her dreamy voice shines on her collaboration with Mick Jenkins, the bouncy, club-like banger “Communicate.” Lenae has also made appearances on albums like <em>blkswn</em> by Smino and <em>Telefone</em> by Noname in which she complements her peers to create passionate lyricism. But each of these seem to pale in comparison to the alliance which is Lenae and Lacy.</p>\n<p>Lenae’s voice is versatile as we receive what sounds like an attempt to escape the boundaries of her own vocal capacities. Her shrill singing on the EP single and opening track, “Sticky,” is reminiscent of the way Frank Ocean experiments with high pitched vocals on songs like “Ivy” or “Pretty Sweet” off of <em>Blonde</em>. Nonetheless, this is where Lenae finds power in testing the limitation of her vocal prowess. She gives Erykah Badu-esque vocals as she induces a dreamlike environment for her listeners when singing, “Slipping ‘til you let me drown; Hate me then you love me now.”</p>\n<p>Not a single moment does Lacy allow us to forget about his psychedelic guitar. On “Closer (Ode 2 U)” the groovy producer makes his presence known through consistently sexy instrumentation. Toward the back end of the track, the lush bass transcends Lenae into a falsetto over Lacy’s faint voice singing “Baby pull me closer, you should let me love you.” With “Computer Luv,” Lacy proves that he can provide a backdrop for Lenae with not only decorative guitar patterns but also through vocal elements as he accompanies her on the song’s hook.</p>\n<p>But really, where the two stand out is with their ability to make use of simplistic instrumentals. This is where Lacy finds success most: in his combination of seemingly effortless but unique guitar chords and synths. Like in his aforementioned standout production on Kendrick Lamar’s “LUST,” Lacy gives a repetitive, unconventional guitar riff on “4 Leaf Clover.” However, this is arguably the standout track of the five-song project. The R&amp;B singers bounce off of one another in synchronization to create a pretty, elegant blend. The duet combines to share their fear of commitment, uncertainty and taking the next step in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, <em>Crush</em> is a modern take on old school R&amp;B. Each song is perfect for laying back, plugging in your headphones and lighting a candle to embrace the sensuality that Lenae and Lacy provide. It is clear that the young duo rely heavily on their predecessors. In <em>Crush</em>, Lacy and Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians. When asked about his opinion on the collaboration, Lacy looked at it as his “Pharrell/Kelis” or “Timbaland/Aaliyah” moment. Although the two have not quite reached such a level, the young virtuosos have created a more than exceptional collection of sensational, romantic ballads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/","id":6646,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6645,6644,6643],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
