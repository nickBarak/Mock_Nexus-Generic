This is the same Irvine team that managed to take two of three against the then No. 1 team in the country TCU in early March.</p>\n<p>Despite having played pretty bad baseball over the last few week, the Anteaters still have three hitters currently batting over .300 including Keston Hiura. The junior currently leads the Big West in batting average with a .394 mark, and he has six home runs to tag along with that. In fact, UCI also holds the top spot in the conference in terms of batting average boasting a .275.</p>\n<p>“UCI is certainly well coached but they have had their struggles lately, kind of limping in like us,” Checketts said. “But I expect a chance to be able to be more aggressive offensively especially later in the weekend due to the pitching coming in.”</p>\n<p>As Checketts alluded to, the problem for the ‘Eaters is the play from the mound. Irvine has the worst team ERA in the conference (6.01), most hits allowed (311) and most earned runs allowed (170). Their three starters all combine to allow a 4.7 ERA.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76872\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76872\" data-attachment-id=\"76872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/ucsb-welcomes-uci-in-must-win-conference-series/jack-dashwood-throws-a-fastball-jorge-mercado-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Baseball_vsNevada-170411-JorgeMercado-01-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jack Dashwood throws a fastball.

UCSB’s pitching staff has also been better in Santa Barbara as they combine for a solid 3.31 ERA at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium and an inferior 6.97 ERA on the road.</p>\n<p>In terms of key players to watch out for, junior Colton Burns has been magnificent this season with a slash line of .355/.466/.464. His batting average ranks fifth best in the conference while his on-base percentage ranks him second. The utility has been solid over the last six ball games going 9 for 23 from the plate including three games with multiple hits.</p>\n<p>Coming off a big game against Nevada in a win on Tuesday, Corey will look to continue his great play in this series. Currently, he is third and fifth on the team in on-base percentage (.395) and batting average (.288), respectively. On Tuesday, the redshirt junior went 2 for 4 from the plate with three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos in the Thursday opener, sophomore Noah Davis will need to be the ace he once was earlier in the year if he wants his team to grab the early series lead.</p>\n<p>Against LBSU in the Big West opener, the right-hander was great going 7.1 innings allowing just six hits and two earned runs. Last week, however, at CSUN, Davis allowed 11 hits and seven earned runs in six innings punching out only three batters.</p>\n<p>“Noah has been hit or miss,” Checketts said. “He either shuts you out, or he gives up seven. I think we are due for the guy that shuts you out.”</p>\n<p>Friday starter Kyle Nelson has been improving steadily as the season has gone on. The junior currently has a 3.74 ERA, 16<sup>th</sup> best mark in the conference, and 41 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Both teams realize the importance of not only this weekend, but the rest of the conference season in general. UCSB and UCI, even with their struggles, are still comprised of teams that have great potential to go out and take the Big West crown, but it starts with this series.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UCI for the first of a three-game set at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 13 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The law will also increase protections for renters; now, landlords must have “just cause” for evicting a tenant who has lived in the property for more than a year, and no-fault evictions will require the landlord to reimburse their tenant for at least one month’s rent.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AB 1482 will fight rent gouging and unjust evictions to help protect millions of Californians who rent the place they call home,” Assemblymember Rob Bonta(D-Oakland), who helped author the bill, said in a press release.

According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates planned to raise rent 12%, on a unit where five tenants live. Due to AB 1482, the leasing company is considering not renewing the lease and instead looking for new tenants they can legally increase the rent on. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. George &amp; Associates did not immediately respond to request for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite I.V.’s low vacancy rates and consistent supply of tenants, however, it’s expensive for landlords to replace their tenants with new ones, according to Klinton Gibbons, property manager for The Hive IV, a leasing company based in Isla Vista.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If anything it’s going to benefit people who decide to move somewhere and decide to stay there the three or four years of their school. If they move around all four years, then they’re not going to be locked into any sort of rent control,” Gibbons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we were to lose income, we would just make it up from people who don’t renew and raise those rents in order to balance that out,” Gibbons added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gibbons added that it usually costs The Hive IV roughly $1,500 to prepare an apartment for a new tenant, which can be spent on cleaning, painting and replacing broken items in the unit.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many legislators and advocates support rent control, UCSB economist Peter Rupert noted that many economists do not have the same conclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much every economist believes that rent control typically works the opposite than what people hope for,” Rupert said, meaning it decreases the supply of housing rather than adding to it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupert added that California should increase the supply of housing, rather than enact rent control, in order to alleviate the housing crisis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other landlords operating in I.V., such as Sierra Property Management, are considering charging their tenants for utilities, which some currently do not have to pay, as a direct response to AB 1482, according to its President Michelle Roberson.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for evictions, most in I.V. happen due to tenants falling behind on rent, according to Undander, which could fall under the law’s “just cause” requirement in order for a landlord to send an eviction notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was written with the intention of alleviating California’s homelessness crisis, as evictions can send more people to the street with nowhere else to go, according to Chiu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our housing crisis is causing instability for renters across our state,” said Wicks in a press release. “AB 1482 provides some much-needed relief, with stronger protections to keep tenants in their homes — by protecting renters from the most egregious of rent increases and unjust evictions.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The junior utility had a game-high four hits in five at-bats and one RBI. He would later score his first of three runs on the day after a UCI error by the third baseman on a freshman utility Armani Smith at bat giving the ’Chos a 1-0 lead after the first inning.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UCI in the top of the fourth got a leadoff double from the Big West’s batting average leader junior utility Keston Hiura. Irvine parlayed the two-base knock into one run, trying the game.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the frame, the Gauchos responded in a big way as sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen homered to right field for a two-run shot, giving his team the 3-1 lead after four innings.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a momentum shifter after that one run Irvine put up,” Cohen said. “Our dugout needed some energy and something to get us going and a two-run homer does that.”</p>\n<p>After a quick inning from Davis, UCSB gave its starting pitcher a very comfortable 7-1 lead after scoring four runs in the bottom of the fifth, all coming from RBI singles by junior infielder Austin Bush, Corey, redshirt junior shortstop JJ Muno and Cohen.</p>\n<p>Irvine would cause trouble at the top of the next inning, scoring two runs, but the game never got any closer than that as the Gauchos kept swinging the bat well and scored one run in the bottom of the sixth and three in the seventh to make the game 11-3 after seven full.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, Davis looked as though he would go the full nine, but he fell just a bit short, pitching 8.1 innings and earning himself the win along with five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen Noah pitch like that, that’s kind of our expectation for him,” Checketts said. “Frankly we are a bit more shocked when it’s not like that.”</p>\n<p>His performance could go a long way in this series as the Gauchos were able to preserve a short-staffed bullpen. Freshman pitcher Conner Roberts stepped in and got the final two outs of the game to secure UCSB’s 11-3 series-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looks like a team that might be on the verge of really turning that corner if it hasn’t done so already. The hitting seems to be there, and as long as the starting pitchers can put together a lengthy, solid start, the Gauchos might be in store for another postseason run.</p>\n<p>That being said, tomorrow is just another game for a team that is under .500, and before UCSB starts thinking about any postseason fantasies, it has to continue its high level of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face the Anteaters for game two at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 14, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
