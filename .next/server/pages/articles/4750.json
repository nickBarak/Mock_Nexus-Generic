This week, stakeholders discussed the details of possible taxes, including a User Utility Tax (UUT) that taxes residents a percentage of their utility bills, and the borders of I.V., specifically regarding whether students living in university-owned housing should be integrated into self-governance plans and be taxed accordingly.</p>\n<p>Community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said after researching Santa Barbara’s use of UUT’s, she found cell phones would be an effective utility to tax in the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“I got the detailed numbers of how much they [Santa Barbara] get for each utility,” Elliott said. “By far their biggest one is cellphones, it’s over a million dollars [in tax revenue per year].”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said including cell phones in an I.V. UUT would prove ineffective because most students’ cell phones are not registered at their I.V. residence address.</p>\n<p>“The little bit of research that’s been done in Isla Vista shows most of the cell phones in Isla Vista are paid for at an addresses outside of Isla Vista,” Thurlow said. “You should look at cellular income with skepticism that it would be anywhere near that much. Most students have cell phones as part of their parents’ plan.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 358px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

CSD.</p>\n<p>“If there is a tax then it needs to be for a specific purpose and there’s no legal definition for specific purpose, for most CSD’s they have interpreted that as one service,” Abboud said. “I’ve been calling around different CSD’s around the state to see if anyone has a tax for more than one [service] but I haven’t found one yet.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she is uncomfortable giving freshmen the power to vote within the proposed CSD and would like to include the more permanent faculty housing community.</p>\n<p>“I have a concern about freshmen who are just coming in, having never had any experience with this community, voting on things,” Soutar said. “If there was any group on campus that I would want to include it would be the faculty housing because I feel like the faculty housing has more interaction [with Isla Vista] and they’ve been around a long time.”</p>\n<p>I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman also said he does not want residents on university property included in I.V. self-governance because it can be difficult to enforce local policies on a state-owned campus and the university has been reluctant to associate with I.V.</p>\n<p>“Even if we claim it’s in the boundaries, it isn’t really in the boundaries because we don’t have the same power over it as all the rest of the land,” Freeman said. “UCSB even treats themselves separately, they try to solve problems in I.V. by putting on events on campus and separating them.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he would like to see on-campus students included in I.V. self-governance to encourage future participation in I.V. government.</p>\n<p>“If we’re talking about transiency and people not getting involved early enough and not wanting to get involved, barring their ability to vote or make any decisions is probably going to guarantee that they never get involved,” Schunk said. “I would only agree to this on the condition that UCSB agrees to pay taxes for those residences.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the decision to include on-campus resident students’ voices in I.V. government should depend on whether or not the university is willing to pay residency taxes at the same rate as I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“I think what it really comes down to for me, is if they’re paying taxes at the same rate everyone else is, then I’m ok with them having a vote,” Gould said. “But I don’t see that happening; I don’t see the university allowing us to tax the on-campus dorms with the utility user’s tax or a bedroom tax, whatever it is at the same rate as Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Williams will be hosting a town hall meeting on Saturday at St. Michael’s University Church to discuss with Isla Vista residents how set up a governing board for an I.V.

UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa began the event by taking questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the creation of a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. would have no direct effect on law enforcement in the area.</p>\n<p>“The county is still responsible for law enforcement in this area. What [it would do] though is give the community a voice as far as communicating with the Sheriff’s department, the university police department [and] the university as a whole [as well as] the county as a whole,” Signa said. “It [would give] them more of a voice to say, ‘Hey, this is what we’re looking for. This is the problem we’re having.’”</p>\n<p>Signa also discussed the university’s $70,000 grant to put up fencing along the cliffs. According to Signa, the project received unanimous support because of its promise to improve the safety of residents.</p>\n<p>“The only people that don’t want it are the people say ‘It blocks my view’ or something like that. But everybody else is very much in favor of it,” Signa said. “You got people dying over something like that and it could be easily remedied by a fence.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61442\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1385995212\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61442\" data-attachment-id=\"61442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/pizza-with-a-cop_john-clow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424974568\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pizza With a Cop_John Clow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61442\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pizza-With-a-Cop_John-Clow-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Students listen on as Sargent Sigma answers student questions.

John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When asked about prominent crime issues this year, Signa said similar to previous years, almost all arrests and violations can be credited to drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the stats, 95 percent of the people that are arrested are arrested for things involving alcohol,” Signa said. “It’s unfortunate it’s such a party atmosphere out here the amount of alcohol really affects the safety of people.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said in recent years the violence he has seen in I.V. has become “intense.”</p>\n<p>“This shouldn’t be a town where you have stabbings; you shouldn’t have fights where people are going to hospitals, and it’s frustrating to see that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, the decreasing crime rates in I.V. are partially a result of the increased presence of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Now, like I mentioned before, the presence … it’s helped. It’s a Band-Aid. It helps fix some of the problems, but it’s not the solution,” Signa said. “We still need to come up with a solution for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Signa said students and residents should not be paranoid about falling victim to a crime, but should also be cautious that I.V. does have a very high crime rate.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing for me — what I want to tell the students and residents, everybody that lives out here — is just watch out for each other,” Signa said. “We’re a community, and community is about taking care of each other.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year physics major Zoltan Urge, the event was well organized and gave I.V. residents an opportunity to connect to local law enforcement in a personal manner.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good outreach to students because recently there’s been a bunch of backlash against the police and this is a good way to reconnect with the community,” Urge said.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Oliver Fahrner approves of the job local law enforcement is doing and said he wishes there were a better way to deal with out-of-town visitors.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any complaints about the officers or law enforcement,” Fahrner said. “My main complaint about Isla Vista is that I wish there was an actual, solid way to combat out-of-towners. I wish there was a way to keep out-of-towners out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/police-share-i-v-status-over-pizza/","id":4747,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4746,4745,4744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia Calmer Than Last Year’s","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This past weekend’s Deltopia street party did not repeat last year’s violent riots and drew only half the crowd, with approximately 10,000 people on the streets of Isla Vista by midday and only ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62043\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1661429318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62040\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62043\" data-attachment-id=\"62043\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/deltopia-participants-walking-on-dp/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428154403\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia_Alex Gonzalez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62043\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.

The Sheriff’s Office partially attributed smaller crowds to the efforts of I.V. residents to defer out-of-towners from coming into their homes and parties. Other factors contributing to the decrease in attendees, according to the Sheriff’s Office, include the university’s efforts, student-only activities, over 100 police officers from across UC campuses and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the surrounding counties. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the county festival ordinance prohibiting music after 6 p.m. and restricting parking on certain streets in I.V. and Goleta was “instrumental” in reducing the crowd size.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated. – Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the 50 percent decrease in attendance from last year, the Sheriff’s Office stated the number of arrests and citations remained high because of increased presence of law enforcement. Preliminary numbers provided by the Sheriff’s Office count 140 citations and 102 arrests issued, compared to 190 citations and 130 arrests during last year’s Deltopia. Medical incidents this year also decreased significantly with only nine medical transports reported compared to 50 in 2014.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason said in an email the crowds this past weekend were more manageable compared to last year.</p>\n<p>“The crowds were smaller and more respectful than last year,” Eliason said in an email. “On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason, the calmer crowds were in part due to the planning and coordination that began months prior to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think the tremendous planning and coordinated effort by everyone affiliated with the event helped to make it more enjoyable than last year,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the number of arrests and citations were a reflection of the saturation of police within I.V. and not necessarily of a reckless student body.</p>\n<p>“Keep in mind that there were over 300 police officers in a one square mile radius,” Schunk said. “If you have a bunch of people in an area drinking, there are going to be people who are committing crimes. If you have hundreds more police officers, then the rate at which those people who are committing even minor nonviolent offensives, there is a higher chance that there will be a police officer nearby.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property. – Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said he agreed the coordinated efforts demonstrated a sense of ownership by I.V. locals for the event.</p>\n<p>“I noticed a lot of cooperation amongst different entities in order to really take ownership of the event and provide structure,” Schunk said. “UCIV, the campus, IVFP, UCPD, and Life of the Party … There was a sense that this was more than just some wild street party that got out of control automatically.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, if this trend of community involvement continues he believes extra policing will not be necessary at future Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“I think even police officers resonated with that and it helped them show a little more restraint,” Schunk said. “I think over time we could see the level of necessary policing decrease more and more as we add in that structure that helps support the event.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said to continue positive progress for a safer Deltopia, he hopes to see more focus on the student volunteer program University of California Isla Vista (UCIV), which helped facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think really the thing I would love to see targeted and expanded upon next year is the UCIV program. And the idea of student volunteers,” Schunk said. “The reception generally was incredibly favorable. Countless people came up to us and said, ‘Thank you so much for taking your time today to hand out water bottles.’ People were almost incredulous.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr said he understands the need for police action during Deltopia and hopes the event will gradually return to a smaller party meant for I.V. locals.</p>\n<p>“I think the intimidation from the sheer number of police this Deltopia was one of the only benefits of mass law enforcement,” Foehr said. “My 300 person party getting shut down at 3:00 p.m. at the time it seemed unnecessary, but it was for the general welfare and I understand that. I feel that next year’s Deltopia will be more local and back to normal like before the [2014] riots because of this intimidating police presence.”</p>\n<p>Foehr also said he believed the increased police presence had some disadvantages.</p>\n<p>“However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property,” Foehr said. “Also, it’s a waste of public resources to have so many cops here, just because of irresponsible college kids.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Nehanda Wells attended Deltopia this past weekend and said she also experienced a run-in with the police, but the incident did not change her opinion on the positive aspects of additional policing.</p>\n<p>“Outside BevMo! … a cop banged on my window and asked to see my ID. I’ve never had that happen before. It was intimidating because I wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Wells said. “I’m not saying that it was a bad thing. I just think that was reaching too far. But as far as having more police here for the weekend, it obviously worked because things were much calmer this year than last year.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/","id":4748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4747,4746,4745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Families Sue For Wrongful Death","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"The families of former UCSB students David Wang, James Hong and George Chen jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Cap...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p>The families of former UCSB students, engineering majors Weihan “David” Wang and Cheng “James” Hong and computer science major George Chen, jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Monday against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) and Capri Apartments over the deaths of their sons during last year’s May 23 Isla Vista mass murder.</p>\n<p>Wang and Hong were roommates of 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) student Elliot Rodger, who murdered the pair as well as their visiting friend, Chen, at their residence at #7 Capri Apartments on Seville Road on May 23 before fatally shooting three other UCSB students and injuring 14 others.</p>\n<p>Representing the families are Los Angeles-based wrongful death law firms Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, seeking to prove the legal liability of Capri Apartments and SBCSD in the deaths of Wang, Hong and Chen. The civil suit contends the defendants neglected signs of Rodger’s threat potential, which could have prevented the tragedy had they been better addressed.</p>\n<p>The families are pursuing compensation from the county for emotional, physical and psychological damages incurred by the loss of their sons in the massacre, as well as attorney’s fees for the costs of lawsuit.</p>\n<p>A joint statement written by Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas stated the plaintiffs are citing SBCSD for negligence before and during an April 30 welfare check on Rodger, and Capri Apartments for carelessness when investigating and assigning roommates.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit alleges that the SBCSD increased the danger to the decedents who were in a place of safety when a welfare check was performed on April 30, 2014,” the press release stated. “The lawsuit also alleges that Capri Apartments failed to perform a proper background check; conduct a reasonable investigation of Rodger before assigning him roommates; properly monitor its roommate pairings; and warn Rodger’s roommates of his unstable and violent propensities.”</p>\n<p>Chen’s mother Kelly Wang, who attended Tuesday’s lawsuit press conference in Los Angeles on behalf of the three victims’ families, said it has been difficult for the victims’ parents to accept that crimes committed by Rodger may have been prevented had the Sheriff’s Department conducted a more thorough search during the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“We were deeply saddened when we learned that in several earlier incidents, the police officers had a chance to investigate the killer, and would have stopped the rampage,” Wang said. “We were truly devastated when we learned that the killer made a narrow escape from the welfare check just less than a month before the massacre.”</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group Owner Todd Becker said Capri Apartments should have been responsible for conducting more thorough research on Rodger in order to realize that he was “not a suitable roommate for anyone,” as proved by numerous conflicts he had with all of his past roommates which required him to constantly move and switch roommates.</p>\n<p>“As student housing, Capri had a duty to investigate Mr. Rodger and determine if he was suitable to be a roommate, of not only our boys but all the other young men that he was roommates with before,” Becker said. “He had seven prior roommates before our kids were his roommates, and he had conflicts with each and every one of them.”</p>\n<p>According to Becker, Capri apartments only investigated the financial capabilities of Rodger to pay rent instead of conducting a thorough background check that would have revealed his inclinations toward anger and violence.</p>\n<p>“With one simple click on the internet … they could have easily found out that this information was available, [that] Rodger was not a suitable roommate,” Becker said. “They only investigated that was Rodger able to pay. Well, his father’s in Hollywood, clearly he’s able to pay. But they didn’t investigate the security issues and his racist and misogynistic tendencies, clearly seen online and in his rantings and ravings and interactions with police, and interactions with all his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Becker said Rodger had several conflicts with past roommates, the first of which occurred August 2011 and continued with a new roommates up to the massacre. According to Becker, Capri apartments made no effort to notify Rodger’s roommates of his past switches despite knowing of Rodger’s prior roommate issues.</p>\n<p>“Despite the defendant’s knowledge of Rodger’s bizarre and violent behavior, they … withheld their knowledge of Rodger’s sadistic behavior,” Becker said.</p>\n<p>According to Becker, it was difficult for Wang, Hong and Chen to protect themselves in the assigned living situation, and generally there should be a “higher standard of investigation to protect these individuals.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not a typical situation where you have somebody across the hall from you in another apartment where you can lock the door, and you can be away from them,” Becker said. “You’re locked inside with this person. That standard wasn’t done and because of that, these three innocent boys and other innocent victims in Santa Barbara were killed.”</p>\n<p>Partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas Patrick McNicholas said the lawsuit claims that actions taken by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s department prior to and during the welfare check also put Wang, Hong and Chen in danger.</p>\n<p>“The second claim is a federal constitutional claim and the theory against the sheriff’s department in this case actually increased the danger to the roommates and their guest, because they were in a position of safety, they were outside of the apartment, they were at school while the welfare check was going on,” McNicholas said.</p>\n<p>According to McNicholas, the easily accessible “knowable information” that the officers failed to check include videos online, evidence of weaponry purchases and a concerned phone call to the Sheriff’s Office from Rodger’s mother. McNicholas said these items should have prompted the officers to do more than question Rodger at the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“With the social media that had been uploaded, with the fact that Elliot Rodger had purchased weapons and ammunition, with the fact that you had a mom who called because she was so concerned about the mental, emotional and psychological state of her son,” McNicholas said. “A welfare check was initiated, and a cache of weapons and ammunition was probably 15 to 20 feet away from the sheriffs who came to the door and they never got through the door.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover declined to comment but issued a statement on the matter.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office cannot comment on a matter of pending litigation, and anything we might say in response would be insufficient when measured against the grief suffered by the families of those killed so tragically on May 23, 2014,” Hoover said in a statement. “Nevertheless, we continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers, and to extend our deepest sympathies to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Wang, there should be new law enforcement requirements and standards set in place to ensure welfare checks include investigations into weapon possession as well as online and social media searches.</p>\n<p>“We believe the procedures in the current police system are outdated and should be repaired to protect innocent lives in today’s world,” Wang said. “For example, a welfare check system must be complete and thorough. It should have a weapons check and internet profile search as a mandatory step.”</p>\n<p>Wang said that, as a mother, she hopes the Sheriff’s Department takes more care to prevent future incidents like that May 23 massacre to happen again, though she was unable to protect her own son.</p>\n<p>“I speak to you with a mother’s heart,” Wang said. “I’m fully supported by the other two mothers of the victims. We love our children with all our hearts. We will love other children with all our mind. We wish we could rely on ourselves to save our sons. We weren’t given the chance, but now we do everything we can to save other children before it’s too late. And that is our way of remembering our sons.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/","id":4749,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4748,4747,4746],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
