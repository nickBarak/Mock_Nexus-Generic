The Jaguars are finishing this season with two wins at most and should secure the first pick. While Jadeveon Clowney is the highest-rated player on most experts’ draft boards, the Jaguars need a franchise quarterback and cannot afford to pass up the opportunity. Blaine Gabbert simply isn’t getting the job done. Mariota is an interesting dual-threat quarterback with unlimited potential, as he is only a redshirt sophomore at Oregon. If he keeps improving as a passer this year and helps the Ducks to a BCS title, he could very well be the first pick.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay hasn’t been much better than Jacksonville this year and has yet to win a game. A new quarterback doesn’t seem to be an option here as the Buccaneers have faith in rookie Mike Glennon to develop into a formidable option. That’s when the Buccaneers go for the highest-rated player rather than the area of most need. Clowney is a once-in-a-decade-type athlete with the size and power of a defensive end and the speed of a safety. Tampa Bay would be foolish to pass up on Clowney and could pair him up on the defensive line with Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. That would certainly improve the Buccaneers’ defense and give them a multitude of weapons similar to their glory days in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Last season, Minnesota rode Adrian Peterson’s record season to the playoffs, but with A.P. slowed down this year, the Vikings are once again floundering The Vikings trio of quarterbacks in Christian Ponder, Josh Freeman and Matt Cassel don’t seem like likely long-term options in Minnesota, although Freeman certainly has an opportunity to change the front office’s mind once he returns from injury. Bridgewater entered this season as the top-rated quarterback, but Mariota simply has more upside and has performed better to date. The Louisville signal caller has the poise in the pocket to balance a Minnesota attack so heavily reliant on the run.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Louis Rams — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Just when the Rams look like they’ve turned a corner, starting quarterback Sam Bradford tears his ACL in a season-ending injury. With Kellen Clemens as the current starter for St. Louis, there does not appear to be much hope in the Gateway City this season. Bradford will be back and fully healthy next season with a young array of offensive weapons. Defensively, St. Louis is set at the most important positions, so the Rams will look to upgrade their offensive line with Matthews replacing the oft-injured Rodger Saffold at right tackle. Matthews has done a superb job of protecting Johnny Football’s blind side the last two seasons at A&amp;M and should have no trouble sliding over to the right side of the line and protecting Bradford this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Steelers — Anthony Barr, OLB, UCLA</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh has been the biggest disappointment in the NFL this season. Defense has always been the key to success for the Steelers, and adding an elite pass rusher who can wreak havoc in Pittsburgh’s 3-4 system looks to be the smartest move. Add Barr to a core of linebackers including LaMarr Woodley, Jarvis Jones and Lawrence Timmons and Pittsburgh might feature the best and most athletic group of linebackers in the game. Barr has been a defensive revelation for UCLA after switching over from playing fullback during his first two seasons. He has the size and speed to slide over to defensive end if need be and does a solid job not only rushing the quarterback, but also roaming the field, racking up tackles and even dropping back into coverage. This guy is a freak of an athlete and the best defensive prospect other than Clowney.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52662\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52662\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-marcus-mariota-goes-first-to-the-jaguars/","id":3238,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3237,3236,3235],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Dodgers Trying to Stay Alive in the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dodgers.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dodgers.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Pitching will be key if the Dodgers want to come back and reach the World Series.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After losing game two of the National League Championship series, the Los Angeles Dodgers were having déjà vu, but it was not the nostalgic kind. Matt Kemp is out for the season, Hanley Ramirez broke a rib after being hit by a 96 mph fastball and Andre Ethier looks as rusty as he’s ever been after missing extended time with an injury.</p>\n<p>To top things off, the Dodgers had just lost the advantage of their trump card. After losing games one and two in which Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw pitched, L.A.’s greatest strength was nullified. L.A. couldn’t get across the key run in game one, wasting valuable scoring opportunities and losing in extra innings. The Dodger bats got even colder in game two, with the team failing to score a run and losing a great Kershaw start on a sacrifice fly. Yasiel Puig was hitless through the first two games, and Ramirez never got the chance to hit in a key situation with the Cardinals constantly pitching around him.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, Carl Crawford has been enjoying a power surge, accounting for the only two runs in game one for the Dodgers. It just wasn’t enough to overcome a deep and fundamentally sound St. Louis team. Ethier missed a ball in centerfield that was enough to nullify Greinke’s excellence and send the game to extras, and the Redbird crowd was ridculously loud in extra innings. Despite seeing the potential that got Los Angeles to the NLCS in the first place, it was St. Louis that kept doing the little things necessary to win the close games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Hyu-Jin Ryu going against St. Louis Cardinals’ ace Adam Wainwright, things were looking grim for the team that was favored to win the World Series weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, Ryu is no slouch. The South Korean native finished the regular season with 14 wins and a 3.00 ERA — impressive numbers that warrant Rookie of the Year considerations. However, Ryu was less than stellar in his first career postseason start, allowing six hits and four runs in three innings. Whether it was nerves or another injury that plagued Ryu, he did not look like himself.</p>\n<p>After getting swept in the first phase of games in St. Louis, L.A. rebounded in a big way upon their return to Chavez Ravine. Ryu pitched like the master control specialist we all knew he could be. His changeup was on point, painting the corners of the strike zone for seven flawless innings, and the Dodgers won 3-0 on Puig, Gonzales and Ramirez’s RBIs. The Dodgers got their clutch hits when they mattered, and the defense backed up Ryu for the shutout.</p>\n<p>At press time, the Los Angeles Dodgers face a 3-1 deficit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series with revitalized hope. Ryu’s reemergence assures that the Dodgers will get one more shot to throw an ace on the table, with Greinke slated to go in game five. One win in two games at home will give the ball back to Kershaw for game six.</p>\n<p>After a tremendous performance that ultimately resulted in a loss, Kershaw has his eyes set on nothing short of a perfect game in his next start, should it come about. That might be aiming high for any other pitcher in baseball, but not Kershaw’s. The numbers speak for themselves. An ERA of 1.83 puts Kershaw’s name up among the ranks of Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Bob Gibson and the ‘first coming’ of Kershaw, an old Dodger named Sandy Koufax. He has allowed less than one baserunner an inning, and every start in which the Dodgers do not win when he’s on the mound is considered a failure.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers went 42-8 over a 50-game stretch that began in June when the team was in last place. It started with the return of Ramirez from injury and the 10,000-watt jumpstart known as Puig. And so was the story when L.A. won game three on Monday. The parallelism is eerily similar.</p>\n<p>Call me optimistic, but I’m expecting something special. The team can take notes and watch video of the different stretches in the season to see what they did right and what they did wrong. And manager Don Mattingly will keep the atmosphere calm, collected and focused. The Dodgers are at their best when their hitters don’t try to do too much, get on base instead of swing for the fences and trust their teammates.</p>\n<p>Ricky Nolasco couldn’t hold his own on Tuesday night against Lance Lynn, but the Dodgers will be in prime position to pull off a three game upset with Greinke going at home in game five and Kershaw in a position to potentially pull even the series back in St. Louis.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is entirely skeptical. The Dodgers are still down and need to continue to figure out ways to win. In the first two games of the series, L.A. made mistakes and did not capitalize with runners in scoring position. But St. Louis made fielding mistakes in game three that prove they aren’t perfect. Make no mistake about it; the Dodgers will go as far as their pitching takes them. The offense is hit or miss, no pun intended, with all the injuries up and down the lineup.</p>\n<p>But L.A. has been in this position before. The situation following game two is too similar to where the team saw themselves in June. They overcame injuries and missed opportunities before, and now they know exactly how to do it again. The Cardinals are known to play mistake-free baseball, so the Dodgers will have to capitalize on their superior talent by matching them play for play. After overcoming St. Louis’ ace and getting back in this series, L.A. is buzzing for baseball once more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of October 16, 2013’s print

But can they do it again? If they could, they would cement themselves as one of the dynasties in NBA history, as only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls have ever won three straight titles.</p>\n<p>However, before Miami can think about the legacy they could create, they have to endure 82 games and get to the NBA finals for the fourth straight year, which will be tougher than ever with an incredibly competitive Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Heat, they happen to have the two-time reigning MVP in LeBron James, who has gotten better every year. The key for Miami this year will be staying healthy. Its players have logged a lot of minutes in the last three years with three finals trips. If they lose key pieces to injury, the three-peat will be a no-go. But with last year’s roster basically intact, if they can stay healthy, you never know. We may be watching history in the making.</p>\n<p>The Hype in Brooklyn</p>\n<p>On paper, Brooklyn has to have one of the best teams in the league, and possibly the best team in the Nets’ history.</p>\n<p>That roster begins with point guard Deron Williams, one of the best in the league. He’ll have a stacked roster to work with options such as Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Brook Lopez. They also brought in defensive stopper Andrei Kirilenko and shooter Jason Terry. Basically, Brooklyn looks set in every position, but what’s unknown is whether they can come together as a team.</p>\n<p>Several of these players are reaching the end of their careers, so the challenge for freshly retired and new Head Coach Jason Kidd will not only be to make this team mesh, but to find chemistry in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Lakers’ Injury Status</p>\n<p>Despite the star power in L.A. last season, the Lakers never came together, particularly because of injuries. This season, there is one injury in particular that will matter most: Kobe Bryant’s.</p>\n<p>This team lives and dies right now on the play of Bryant. Nevertheless, this hard-working, determined superstar needs to be careful not to come back too soon. He’s no longer 25 and is showing signs of slowing down. As badly as he wants to be on the court, he needs to stay healthy if the Lakers want a shot at making the playoffs, because without him, they won’t.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with Bryant, the Lakers will always be dangerous. His scoring ability can bring in a win any night of the week.</p>\n<p>A New Era in Sacramento</p>\n<p>The Sacramento Kings have finally finalized where they’ll be playing for a long time: Sacramento. Now that they can actually focus on basketball, it’ll be about rebuilding in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings just announced the contract extension of DeMarcus Cousins and have decent depth at the point guard spot between Isaiah Thomas and Greivis Vasquez.</p>\n<p>With new ownership working on a new arena and increasing ticket sales and sponsorship, Sacramento is moving in the right direction. They’re certainly not championship material yet, and may not even be playoff contenders, but the improvement by the Kings should be tangible.</p>\n<p>Howard in Houston</p>\n<p>The question right now with Dwight Howard is whether he can find a team he can be happy with. With Orlando, he wasn’t winning, but he was the star. With L.A., he wasn’t the focus and that was a problem. Nothing’s been right so far. So, Howard is once again starting over, this time in Houston.</p>\n<p>Howard brings a much-needed inside presence, as well as a defensive edge, to a Rockets team that has one great scorer in James Harden and a great distributor in Jeremy Lin.</p>\n<p>With his height, wingspan and athletic ability, Howard should be a premier center this year and should turn the Rockets into a playoff contender.
