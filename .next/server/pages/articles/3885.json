The man was quick to answer: “God,” he told the officer.</p>\n<p>Unfazed, the officer asked what the man was doing. “Purples fives in my eyes,” he replied.</p>\n<p>The psychedelic poet continued, uttering more strange answers when questioned. When asked his address, he mentioned a “Thermo Nuclear Device” and at one point began speaking in numbers.</p>\n<p>And when he wasn’t articulating the outlandish and bizarre, he would stand with his eyes closed and refuse to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>The officer could not detect the presence of alcohol, but judging from his weird behavior, arrested the 35-year old man for public intoxication of a controlled substance and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Angels in the Bike Rack</b><br>\n<i>Tues., July 29, 9:44 a.m. —</i> Officers on a patrol down Embarcadero Del Norte came across a young woman passed out between a pair of bikes parked in front of Freebirds.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the sidewalk sleeper and observed that she had soiled her pants and had what appeared to be dried spit and leftover food on her chin.</p>\n<p>When the officers awoke the weeknight reveler, she was extremely disoriented. She could not remember her own name and told the deputies she was at her home in Agoura Hills, Calif., some 70 miles from Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the officer was skeptical of her story, she added that she was “walking home” to Agoura Hills with her friend. When asked what friend she was walking with, the 23-year-old woman pointed towards the sky and said “him.”</p>\n<p>However, the deputy knew that not even holy providence could have steered the drunk woman home that night. Instead, he arrested and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Doggie Heaven or Just the Dog House?</b><br>\n<i>Sun., July 20, 2:43 a.m. —</i> Residents of 6744 Sabado Tarde Rd. contacted the Isla Vista Foot Patrol to report an unknown female wandering around their front yard, barefoot.</p>\n<p>When the deputies contacted the 22-year-old woman, she was unable to speak coherently or provide answers to simple questions such as her name or address.</p>\n<p>Additionally, her face was covered in what appeared to be mud, and when the officers stood a little closer, they were overwhelmed by the familiar smell of vomit and alcohol.</p>\n<p>When asked why she was in a stranger’s yard, she informed the deputies that she was trying to locate her missing dog. There was one slight problem with her story, however: Her dog lived with her parents in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>The officer decided to let the dog story slide, and again asked the young woman where she lived. She began uttering numbers, but the deputy eventually discovered she was simply reciting a phone number.</p>\n<p>Hoping for at least one legitimate answer, the officer then asked the barefoot, mud-covered, vomit-reeking loiterer for her phone number, but she replied by repeatedly saying her last name.</p>\n<p>Clearly unable to care for herself, the officer arrested the severely confused woman, and transported her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-05/police-blotter-27/","id":3885,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3884,3883,3882],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dumped and Fade-oraded Sunday, Nov. 26, 12:01 a.m. – An officer responded to a call for service on the 6600 block of Trigo Road after receiving a report that a 19-year-old man had broken into hi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Dumped and Fade-oraded<br>\nSunday, Nov. 26, 12:01 a.m. – An officer responded to a call for service on the 6600 block of Trigo Road after receiving a report that a 19-year-old man had broken into his girlfriend’s house.</p>\n<p>The subject, who had just been pushed out of the residence by people inside, was attempting to climb up onto the balcony when the deputy made contact with him.</p>\n<p>The officer immediately noticed that the discombobulated delinquent was extremely intoxicated.</p>\n<p>During questioning, the man could not tell the officer where he lived, because he had “drank three bottles of Gatorade mixed with vodka.”</p>\n<p>The subject repeatedly tried to tell officers something, but could not manage to put together a coherent sentence. As the man’s growing frustration got the better of him, he began to cry.</p>\n<p>Officers then arrested the man for public intoxication. While deputies transported him to jail, the man became very emotional and again started to cry.</p>\n<p>The subject confessed that his girlfriend had just broken up with him, and he had only wanted to give her a birthday card. The man admitted that he had made a mistake by drinking too much “cheap” vodka and apologized to officers for getting plastered.</p>\n<p>The man was booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Flash of Brilliance Belligerence<br>\nFriday, Nov. 10, 5:20 a.m. – Officers walking by a bus stop on Camino del Sur observed a 21-year-old man lying on a bench.</p>\n<p>As a deputy approached the man, he saw that the subject’s pants were unzipped and his penis was exposed. The man was lying in a pool of urine, which streamed down the bench into a nearby gutter.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to wake the leaky lawbreaker by shouting at the subject, but eventually had to administer a sternum rub to elicit a response.</p>\n<p>When the wiz kid woke up, he was extremely disoriented and repeatedly told officers that he lived on “Ryan Street.”</p>\n<p>Since that street does not exist anywhere near Isla Vista, the officer decided to arrest the filthy flasher for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed and left to mull over his own mess, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>All I Want to Do Is Bicycle!!!<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 25, 9:15 p.m. – Deputies were patrolling the 6700 block of El Colegio Road when they saw a 22-year-old man zoom past them on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>As the subject sped past the officers, he fell off the bike and flew through the air, before ultimately crashing on to the pavement. He stumbled for several yards before regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the man picked up his bike and threw it to the ground. He then flopped down on to the street, where he sat, pouting, until an officer approached him.</p>\n<p>The deputy detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the surly cyclist’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When the officer began questioning the subject, the man attempted to answer -but only managed to say, “I live at 555… ah… I’m not sure.”</p>\n<p>Despite the commendable effort to remember where he lived, the man was completely oblivious to his surroundings and could not even stand up. To ensure the man’s own safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/","id":3882,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3881,3880,3879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Why is the Rum Always Gone?\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Why is the Rum Always Gone?<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy contacted the man, he noticed the subject had a fixed look in his eyes – silently staring as if in a trance.</p>\n<p>The officer helped the man to the curb, and placed him on the ground in a seated position while he filled out the police report for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The mesmerized man remained mute during the process, and the deputy collected most of his information from the friend of the speechless subject.</p>\n<p>When the man stood up to be transported to the police station, a water bottle with dark liquid inside fell out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>The man ended his silent streak and told the deputy, “Hey, that’s Captain Morgan’s rum.”</p>\n<p>The officer told the man he did not care who’s liquor it was, and poured out the contents of the bottle before transporting the subject to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Getting Arrested<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 12:35 a.m. – Deputies stationed on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed an 18-year-old man stagger into the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The man walked right up to an oncoming car, forcing the driver to slam on his breaks and swerve to miss the subject.</p>\n<p>The deputy shinned a flashlight on the man, and ordered him to leave the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The subject eventually staggered to the south side of the road, where he met the officer with bloodshot eyes, as well as the strong odor of alcohol and urine.</p>\n<p>The man told the officer he was trying to find a ride home, but could not remember his address.</p>\n<p>The deputy offered the man a lift, which he readily accepted.

He then asked her how much alcohol she had consumed, and she said “none,” despite exhibiting several signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p>When asked what year she was born, the heartbroken honey replied, “1929.”</p>\n<p>Because the woman had no friends to look after her, the deputy decided to arrest her for her own safety.</p>\n<p>During booking, the woman repeatedly lied about her age and expressed her distaste for the IVFP officers, saying “I am 19.
