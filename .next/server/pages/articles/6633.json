It was a beautiful 73</span><b>°</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out, and we were lounging around making plans for the night. It was only 30 seconds into the song and we were both already blinking back tears. If this song can hit you with the feels when the sun is shining on your shoulders and there’s not a thing weighing on your mind, listening to this song as you’re huddled in the library at 3 a.m. contemplating every single life decision equals instant heartbreak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunhidi Sridhar</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Runaway” – Kanye West</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s something about Kanye being real and raw about his weaknesses that gets me on that crying-about-midterms wave. “Runaway” is the perfect song to plug in your headphones and take a respite from the world; it’s nine minutes of pure reflection. “Runaway” echoes regret (in my case, the regret of not starting to study for midterms earlier). The last three minutes of pure instrumental leaves space to to pick yourself up after shedding some tears. Even though I want to “runaway as fast as [I] can” from midterms, if Kanye can push through his struggle, so can I. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lizzy Mau</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Vienna” – Billy Joel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Slow down, you crazy child,” the Piano Man cautions us in these times of chaos. Beginning with a soft piano intro, Billy Joel mimics the feeling of drinking a glass of Chardonnay in the vineyards of Vienna, Austria. In an environment of complete confusion, where it seems like we are one midterm away from pursuing a career as a fitness model that advertises protein shakes on Instagram, the song reminds us to enjoy the here and now. Considering the fact that we are never guaranteed success, the only constant we can really rely on is that place, person or activity that inspires the energy we need to get through the many stressful days. So why not partake in a little bit of self-care and just enjoy life rather than speeding through its daily motions? “Vienna” waits for you. </span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 3662px;\" width=\"675\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medlyn Grasheyella</span></i>\n<p><strong>“Ex-Factor” – Lauryn Hill</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With breakup season on the way, this classic bop is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certified</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cry. There’s something especially poignant about Lauryn Hill’s voice that makes her words carry enormous weight. Her croonings of lost love on this track are just as powerful 20 years later as they were then, and the soulful backdrop remains a timeless classic. “Ex-Factor” expresses feelings that we have all felt to some degree, whether it’s minor rejection or a world-crushing heartbreak. It’s also a bit ironic that Drake sampled this song shortly before getting exposed for hiding his child and abandoning the mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Pasion-Gonzales</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Eleanor Rigby” – The Beatles</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” still haunts me and has ever since I was five, when my dad first played it for me. Even then, before I could understand the beautiful lyrics and the heartbreaking story they tell, I could feel the sorrow in this iconic Beatles song. After hours of self-imposed isolation, studying alone in the library for your first midterms of the year, you’ll be sobbing along when Paul McCartney asks where all the lonely people come from. A lament to the hardships of the elderly and dying alone, “Eleanor Rigby” will help you let out all those stress tears when you just need to simp during stressful midterm season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucy Holley</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars” – Mitski</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna see the whole world / I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent / I wanna to see the whole world.” Was wide-eyed mortal panic was ever felt, or said, so simply? In a panic bender of less than two minutes, Mitski pins everything from interview anxiety to ideal locations for death (Jerusalem, please). Her voice is frantic, carried by an instrumental that sounds less like guitar shredding and more like a guitar literally being shredded. It’s an experience accessible only after five shots of espresso.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if my body really is made of crushed little stars (which it is, according to popular consensus), remind me why I’m stuck memorizing solubility charts at 3 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Three Little Birds” – Bob Marley</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this song is filled with encouraging lyrics, it’s perfect for that moment during midterm studying when you’re about to tap out from exhaustion and frustration, but keep telling yourself to pull through because it’ll all be over soon. In that moment, you feel like every little thing is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gonna be alright, as Bob Marley says, since your test is tomorrow and you’re still up at 2 a.m. studying (and crying). However, once “Three Little Birds” engulfs your ears through the speakers in your headphones and Marley advises you to not worry about a thing, the tears once shed out of pure misery now emerge from a place of hope. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristina Valencia</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Doomed” – Moses Sumney</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somber and haunting, “Doomed” by Moses Sumney is the perfect track for your pre-midterm breakdown (or your post-midterm GPA funeral). Questioning the possibility of being doomed to live a life without love, Sumney’s existential crisis can easily translate to a college student’s eternal pondering of whether or not one can live without good grades, a degree or a job. Lean into Sumney’s mournful lyrics and breathtaking falsetto and supplement its lack of percussion with the steady sound of slamming your head into the library table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Jackson</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Needle In the Hay” – Elliott Smith</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you press play and the grim chords of “Needle In the Hay” lead into Elliott Smith’s somber tone of voice, you can predict where the song is about to transport you. The track is quick in being applicable to the plethora of feelings a college student will likely experience during midterm season, meaning that it’s perfect to sob into the night before your dreaded exam. As Smith sings, we experience feeling “strung out and thin” as we attempt to cram in material before exam day, somehow not remembering anything from the past few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony Singh</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Tears Dry On Their Own” (Original Version)  – Amy Winehouse</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winehouse sings of her despair and feelings of regret as she begins to walk away from a lover. The pain she feels from trying to move on is especially felt in her vocals in this original version. The songstress’s vivid lyrics bring listeners back to a time when they, too, had to close a sentimental affair. The backup vocalists singing “tears dry on their own” at the end of each chorus resemble a heartbreak song from the Motown era.This song is guaranteed to leave you crying as you cope with the end of your social life during midterms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Delamare</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Rock Bottom Riser” – Smog </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you get a lead feeling in your bones, or you feel empty after the stress of exams. As I inch toward my first college midterms, I am reminded, once again, of the feeling of home — the warmth of my mother, or even my cat — and I am whole again. This song encapsulates this as I realize that this isn’t the end, that midterms won’t be the death of me and that I, too, am a rock-bottom riser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sai Sondh </span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“Come Back to Earth” – Mac Miller</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac Miller’s “Come Back to Earth” from his final album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great song to cry to when stressing out over midterms. “Come Back to Earth” has poignant lyrics that focus on mental health. Miller maintains, “My regrets look just like texts I shouldn’t send … I just need a way out of my head.” I think we can all relate to sending a risky text to a friend or significant other and overthinking it, or having an endless cycle of negative thoughts. UCSB students can also relate to the lyric, “And don’t you know that sunshine don’t feel right, when you inside all day.” Who wants to be inside studying all day at the library when you could be out soaking in the sunshine or surfing at the beach?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Wiitala</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“SUMMER”- BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the heat of the summer I had no papers to write, midterms to take or TAs who won’t email me back. At this point in fall quarter, I know the one thing we all want more than a 4.0 GPA is to go back to irresponsibly basking in the Isla Vista summer sun with all of our friends on an oceanside deck. Go ahead and give “SUMMER” by BROCKHAMPTON a listen and let that summer nostalgia sink in to the sound of wistful piano chords and guitar runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin Fauni</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>“The Middle” – Jimmy Eat World</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of the quarter again. Your brain feels like that microwaved mashed potato you forgot about after all your doze-offs snowballed into two-hour naps. But if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that the best remedy for midterm melancholia is some nice, wholesome 2001 pop-punk. Still don’t understand the confusing way your calculus professor teaches u-substitution? “Just do your best, try everything you can!” Hand cramping from all the bubbling and writing? “It just takes some time!” Feeling like this class is dragging on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> longer than you’d like? “You’re in the middle of the ride, everything will be just fine, everything will be alright!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Feliciano</span></i></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;\">“No Hard Feelings” – The Avett Brothers</span></strong><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s midterm season and you feel like you’re dying, so why not listen to a song that perfectly embodies that emotion? “No Hard Feelings” by the Avett Brothers is that song. Its calming melody paired with its depressing lyrics about death is the perfect combination to induce a stream of tears. The Avett Brothers have a profound way of making music that touches the innermost core of our emotions, and this is especially true of “No Hard Feelings.” So sit back, let your existential crisis consume you and cry it out to the Avett Brothers (and their ever-present banjo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elissa Padilla</span></i></p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-05/songs-to-cry-to-during-midterms-an-artsweek-playlist/","id":6633,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6632,6631,6630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[6548,6554,6633,6642,6643,6784,6943],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Cuco Welcomes Students Back in Annual Storke Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Cuco is not motivated by money or “making it big” with a record label; he’s doing music because that’s what he’s always wanted to do.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From his mellow psychedelic tunes that you might hear blasting from a dayger on oceanside DP to his diverse background as a young Chicano artist, first-generation American and fellow Dreamer, Cuco epitomizes what UCSB life is all about.

Cuco started out by uploading his Spanish melodies to Bandcamp in 2015. His popularity soared with the release of his 2017 single “Lo Que Siento,” a track in which he discusses dreaming of love when he’s alone. His lyrics are seamless — even though alternating lines can be in different languages, English or Spanish, the song still flows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many students of the UCSB population, Cuco grew up in southwest L.A. county as a first-generation Mexican-Americanand can relate to many Dreamers here on campus. The artist is leading by example and through his music, exemplifying that being a Dreamer can make you stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco also identifies with and advocates for members of the LGBTQ+ community. “But what I think is cool also is that I see more artists of color not just coming from Mexican descent but different orientations with their sexuality and gender identity,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pigeons &amp; Planes, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he shared his humble start as a young independent artist: “I never had connections at any point to the industry. Like, my life was like literally going to school, watching my mom clean houses, my dad driving limos and every other weekend having a guitar … This is raw, this is me,” the artist said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco is not motivated by money or “making it big” with a record label; he’s doing music because that’s what he’s always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84210\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"899396935\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84208\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84210\" data-attachment-id=\"84210\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/marcos-reynoso_cuco_online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=1281%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1281,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Marcos Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84210\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3-656x1024.jpg?resize=656%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=656%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=160%2C250&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1199&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcos-Reynoso_Cuco_ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1281&amp;ssl=1 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is Cuco following his creative aspirations, but he’s also helping his parents along the way: “Growing up, any first-generation child’s dream is literally always, ‘I want to help my parents out. I need to get my parents out of working. I want to pay my parents’ mortgage off. I want to get my parents out,’ and that’s hopefully what I’m going to do.” He’s making his parents proud not only through his music or success but also through his motivation to bring them up with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fusing traditional Latinx music with contemporary indie, Cuco is bridging the gap between the two genres and, in turn, creating his own musical niche. His eclectic sound is not like anything on the charts now. He took a risk keeping close to his roots, and it paid off. His sound melds old influence with his own beats, creating his personalized flare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many in the audience connected to his music, even though he is still slightly hesitant to fully embrace his craft. “I don’t know if y’all are going to vibe with my music, but sing this shit with me, alright?” Cuco asked as the audience erupted with cheers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being approached by record labels, Cuco has resisted, standing strong as an independent artist. Even though many refer to his music as “dream” or “bedroom pop,” Cuco’s music cannot be fully defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuco has broken barriers not only with his music but also with his messages of tolerance, acceptance and self-love. “I feel like people hate that I’m a guy and I’m making this, like, super soft music,” he once explained, “so I like seeing really big white buff dudes looking all pissed at me because I’m on stage being successful and brown.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/cuco-welcomes-students-back-in-annual-storke-show/","id":6630,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6629,6628,6627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Azizi Gibson Electrifies Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gametime.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gametime.jpg?resize=960%2C480&ssl=1","description":"Though his set was brief, his performance was packed with energy and enthusiasm.

The first of which, someone who isn’t me took an edible and got unrealistically high in Orange County. The second time, I saw a glimpse of Gibson from afar at FYF in Los Angeles. Both of my initial attempts to see Azizi were somewhat in vain. Thus, I was slightly reluctant to see him for round three.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no expectations going into Velvet Jones, but grew pleasantly surprised as the night unfolded. The staff was extremely accommodating to me and my friends and I definitely felt welcomed at the venue. I heard that Velvet Jones was grimy and intimate, but I had no idea I would be able to walk right in 30 minutes after the opening acts started and find myself at the front of the venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 30 minutes after the doors opened, the first opener, Brayell, came on stage. He’s a smaller artist based in Isla Vista who spat exceptionally meaningful bars. I appreciated his vulnerable stage presence and profound lyricism.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next opener, DJ Ill Chris, heavily contrasted Brayell’s sobering charisma. He came on stage with a bold energy and got the crowd jumping on their feet. During his act, I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">somehow</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was summoned onto the stage. I jumped around for a minute or two with Ill Chris and even got my friends to come on for a hot sec. While dancing on stage with an artist I didn’t know was slightly intimidating, the gesture was all in good fun and definitely hyped my friends and the crowd up more.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after Ill Chris left the stage, opener Jez Dior came on and sang heartfelt yet seductive songs for a firm half hour. His sound is exciting and catchy, making it easy for a fan who had never heard his music to enjoy his live experience and sing along.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After dancing through opening acts for over an hour and a half, the crowd was excited for Azizi to grace the stage. I was lucky to be surrounded by friendly girls in the crowd which made waiting all the more diverting </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last time I saw Azizi at the Observatory the crowd was aggressive and violent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Azizi came on abruptly and began rapping without introduction. He played a fan favorite, “Toast,” as his second song; he didn’t provide much buildup to the more energetic aspects of his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though his set only ran for 45 minutes, he was able to incorporate aspects of his personality throughout the show. Compared to his performance two years ago, I noticed that his self-expression was rather mute, though that distinction could easily be attributed to the size of the venue. Azizi is definitely a positive person who purports a general sense of optimism and kindness. His overall message to his fans rang along the lines of inclusivity. His song “Levels” is a good introduction to the all-inclusive and uplifting features of his music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He told the crowd that if we wanted to get to know anything about his personality, we should listen to his song “Xenophile,” the titular track from his newly-released album. I expected “Xenophile” to hint toward inclusivity, but it’s actually a rather depressing song. He sings, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m looking at my lifespan, I’m drowning can’t deal with your shit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> / </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t got no time man, no time man, to deal with a bitch</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> / Y</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eah I’m dealing with life man, yeah I’m dealing with life man</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His set was particularly short; I was disappointed that he didn’t play one of my favorites of his, “Backwards Books,” or anything off his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hentai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> EP. On that note, Azizi’s music is also known to be extremely vulgar and sexual. Azizi is a multi-faceted artist; one of his major themes revolves around fetishizing (or at least extreme fondness) of Asian women. A few of his songs open up with an audio recording of an “anime-esque” girl speaking. However, that aspect of his music doesn’t really come out much in his live performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though his set was brief, his performance was packed with energy and enthusiasm. The venue itself is probably what contributed to the overall enjoyment of the concert. The staff at Velvet Jones was much friendlier than other concert venues that I’ve been to. The venue is so intimate that it’s easy to be extremely close to the performer. The excitement of the opening acts would not have been as intense if it weren’t for how easy it was to get close to the artists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Azizi ended with an extremely energetic rendition of “Smoking With the Gods,” sung much more rambunctiously than the recorded version. Azizi undeniably knows how to get a crowd riled up and engaged in nothing but the music.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

The Man brought the festival atmosphere without the dusty desert air and notorious outfits to the Santa Barbara Bowl last Saturday, alongside soul-influenced performers, Chicano Batman.</p>\n<p>Strutting along the stage, clad in tuxedos and Vans Old Skools, Chicano Batman’s guitar riffs rippled throughout the crowd. A liberating sensibility dared the general admission floor to dance as if they were at Coachella, moving in free-form along to the groove. Dripping in the highest tuxedo fashion, Chicano Batman prove their eclectic authenticity by tapping into the golden era of soul music and the emotional ballads symbolic of Spanish music.</p>\n<p>The group have already carved a name for themselves as must-see festival stunners with their 2017 Tropicalia performance and through gracing the Coachella stage multiple times. The Los Angeles four-piece played whimsical songs such as “Black Lipstick” and “Magma,” which both channel elements of 50s blues percussion. When the band seamlessly transitioned into “Freedom is Free,” the crowd waved their hands and twirled around to the rhythm as if they were Penny Lane in “Almost Famous.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite Chicano Batman bringing their immersive, delightful tunes to the SB Bowl, they also brought political and social problems to the foreground with their enlightening lyrics.

The Man brought the stage alight with energy and the occasional guitar solo that induced a momentarily stunned sensation among the crowd. Despite their lack of interaction with the crowd, the screen depicting everything from colorful animations of faces to odes to Portland behind the band forewarned the audience that “We are not very good at stage banter, so our manager wrote some stuff on the screen to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>The Portland-based band’s tinge of sarcastic humor and honesty was also apparent when they projected the subtitles, “If you’re here for ODESZA, you’re early,” on the screen of their Sunday afternoon Coachella set. Most of the festival crowd happens to not be interested in the lengths of synth rock music, yet the band rocked out the eager Santa Barbara Bowl crowd with groovy explorations of their latest project.</p>\n<p>The riveting performance of “Keep On” raptured the crowd, as the dosage of rock intermingled with the rotating neon lights that were either bound to cause a mild optical migraine or lead the audience into a psychedelic trip.</p>\n<p>The tight-knit band seems to have a compatible link with each other where they communicate by mere instrumentals. Guitarist Eric Howk, fueled the band’s primary power riffs all the while he was in his wheelchair. Meanwhile, John Gourley is zoned in a trance of giving the crowd a variety of vocal changes, and Jason Sechrist provides the tempo changes through his fluid drum changes. Kyle O’Quin heavily focuses on the synthesizers as if they are a lifeline, Zoe Manville offered her delicate falsetto to illuminate hard-hitting tracks and bassist Zach Carothers emphasized the vein of rock running through the band’s catalog.</p>\n<p>Summer of 2017 marked Portugal. The Man’s release of the intoxicating medley of soul, rock and analog-electronic sounds, <em>Woodstock</em>. The band’s instant hit “Feel It Still” had not only landed its way onto Apple commercials, and found a temporary home at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Top 40, but it also won them the title of a Grammy-award winning Group Performance. The band melds their hip-hop influences on tracks like “So Young” that are reminiscent of the production found on legendary Quasimoto and MF DOOM albums.</p>\n<p>Portugal. The Man has mastered a way to interpolate montages of sounds that have impacted how the band crafts their instrumentation. The charge to their way at the top of the charts is credited to the band’s ability to use a Frank Ocean method of limiting the release of their music for four years in order to get the closest they can to a perfect album.  The album is attested to effectively collaborating with the industry’s top producers to create hits that submerge audiences into a world that touches everywhere from neoclassical soul to rap rhythms.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82720\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1950508301\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82717\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82720\" data-attachment-id=\"82720\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/sbbowl_siavash_ghadiri_portugal_the_man-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82720\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SBBowl_Siavash_Ghadiri_Portugal_the_Man-13.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the concert hit the one hour mark, Portugal. The Man incentivized the crowd to stand up and scream the lyrics to the band’s well-known hit, “Feel It Still,” a song that has both meandered its way onto Apple and Vitamin Commercials and beat out the infamous Luis Fonsi and Justin Bieber collaboration “Despacito” at the Grammys.</p>\n<p>The band set their instruments aside and looked longingly to the packed crowd, teasing the crowd into believing that they were just about to end their set. The crowd ruptured in applause with the loudest shrieks coming from drunk 40-year-old men dressed in the go-to Portland hipster attire. Portugal. The Man answered the crowd’s demands by playing the genre-bending “Noise Pollution” and the anthemic “Hip Hop Kids” that combined the psychedelic visuals playing on the screen and the thundering drums.</p>\n<p>Chicano Batman escalated the excitement for the night, as their groovy-surf blend went hand-in-hand with gazing at SB Bowl’s hilltop view of the ocean. Meanwhile, Portugal. The Man brought their ability to alleviate temporary stress by illuminating the stage with gritty guitar solos and lively strobe lights straight from an 80s flick.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82717\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82717\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/portugal-the-man-and-chicano-batman-illuminate-sb-bowl/","id":6632,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6631,6630,6629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
