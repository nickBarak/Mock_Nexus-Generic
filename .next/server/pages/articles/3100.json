Though Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores was origi- nally scheduled to attend, she was unable to make an appear- ance due to scheduling conflicts.</p>\n<p>Stein, a UC Berkeley graduate student who is working toward a law degree and a master’s degree in public policy, said the event’s goal was to encourage students to become more involved in and informed about the decisions made at local, statewide and national levels with regard to UC policies.</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, I give voice to student concerns at the highest level of UC administration … I empower students to solve their own problems,” Stein said. “We have to engage our administrators, and what that means is that Student Regents are one part of a much larger student movement that is sort of attacking from all angles.”</p>\n<p>Stein said while protest is often an effective method of communicating with the board, much more is needed to fully engage the administrators and promote widespread change. Some potential ways to take a more noticeable stance include holding advocacy protests on several campuses and lobbying at regents’ meetings, Stein said.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Sophia Armen, it is crucial that students recognize their voice on the Board of Regents and work for further representation in committees that allocate large amounts of funding and other resources to the university.</p>\n<p>“It is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of education that we as students in the UC, who number over 200,000, only have one student vote on the Board of Regents that raise our fees and affect our daily lives,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Stein said Prop. 30 was a huge victory for students, but only a temporary solution for the coming cuts to the UC system. According to Stein, students must re-involve themselves in advocacy efforts for the upcoming 2013-14 year and any future year in order to avoid huge tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“As a result, students have to go back to Sacramento to begin the process of lobbying for another tuition buyout,” Stein said. “We passed Prop. 30 through student voter registration and student voter turnout … now we have to go back and lobby to negate a tuition increase for the second year in a row.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, ensuring the transparent use of funds generated through Prop. 30 is one of many causes that contrib- ute to the importance of “fighting for our right to education as a public good.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and political science major Sydney Bennet, a campus organizing director for the A.S. External Vice President of Student Affairs, said students need to take action by getting involved with campaigns that speak directly to California legislators and create more opportunities to lobby in support of education.</p>\n<p>“We represent students on statewide, national and UC level, and our goal is to make sure education remains afford- able and accessible,” Bennet said. “This [event] was just the first step.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 19th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-19/uc-student-regent-jonathan-stein-discusses-university-funding-proposition-30-ucsb/","id":3100,"author":{"id":203,"name":"Jennifer Chang"},"related":[3099,3098,3097],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":203,"name":"Jennifer Chang","biography":"Not available","articles":[3100],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Conflict Arises Over Denial of A.S.

Several students approached the podium during the public forum and argued that the council ignored the student body’s interests.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one speaker placed responsibility for the council’s decision on Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker due to her tie-breaking vote. Although Stryker said she supports the SOCC, she does not believe A.S.’s special projects budget should finance the conference.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she offered to dedicate $600 from her office’s funds toward the conference but did not receive a request from the group until Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter said the council’s debate focused on the appropriateness of using the special projects budget rather than the SOCC’s goals.</p>\n<p>Walter asked student attendees for input to help prove the council’s support after hearing numerous speakers.</p>\n<p>“Would you like it if we make a public statement of support, perhaps published in the Nexus — hopefully, if the Nexus will run it — would that make be a sufficient show of support?” Walter said.</p>\n<p>However, SOCC speakers said a public statement would only serve as an appeasement.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Sophia Armen, who chose to address the council as a student body member, said the student government’s endorsement for such events is vital for the campus community.</p>\n<p>“Support folks that do good shit! Students of color are disproportionately marginalized [and] they have to go through so much every day,” Armen said. “Being in this room, sitting at this table is a privilege. You are no longer acting for yourself; you are acting in consideration of other people … The climate of this room is not progressing us towards making this a more inclusive association.”</p>\n<p>In light of the council’s $145 Oct. 27 allocation toward the Campus Democrats, A.S. President Harrison Weber said the issue provokes a larger discussion on the council budget’s intended use.</p>\n<p>“The council needs to define what [its] special projects [budget] is for,” Weber said. “It sends a mixed message that the role of special projects isn’t to fund groups, but another group was funded. Also, I think it speaks to the larger issue: we need to have more discussion outside of this council.”</p>\n<p>The council had yet to discuss the bills and resolutions on last night’s agenda including legislation to restructure the External Vice President of Local Affairs, IVP and CAB Foundation offices as of press time.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/conflict-arises-denial-funds/","id":3097,"author":{"id":202,"name":"Yishian Yao"},"related":[3096,3095,3094],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also approved the Investment Advisory Committee’s investments and discussed a new plan to make taxi rides more accessible to students with limited funds.</p>\n<p>The Chinese Student Association approached the Senate during public forum requesting approximately $3,000 for their upcoming masquerade ball in downtown Santa Barbara, for which they need transportation, decorations and advertising. They would charge participants $30 each, some of which would go back to the organization.</p>\n<p>Though Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez was reluctant to speak for Finance Board before an official vote, he said they would be concerned about the fee as the event may be considered a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“If the Senate approved the money, it would need to be a one-time exception,” Martinez said. “We would be concerned about the $30 fee. We can’t [fund] decorations, [and] we don’t fund more than $250 for audio,” he added.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Angela Lau noted the differences between a philanthropic event and a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“They aren’t doing philanthropy, so we can’t fund them,” Lau said. “They are selling tickets which are supposed to go back to funding their event. We don’t fund fundraisers.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether CSA had approached other organizations for money, because of their intention to provide an alternative to the Isla Vista party scene, member Angel Chin said they had not been successful.</p>\n<p>“It has been a week past [since we asked for money from After Dark] and we haven’t heard anything from them so I’m not sure we are getting anything,” she said. She had not contacted any other organizations.</p>\n<p>Lao was also concerned about the location of the event.</p>\n<p>“It’s off-campus and we try to keep our funds for on-campus events,” she said. “We only fund events that are for the students.”</p>\n<p>Senators voted to approve zero dollars for the CSA. Senator Ashley Koide wanted to clarify that this was not out of spite.</p>\n<p>“It seems like it’s really bad that we’re giving zero but it’s just a policy thing,” she said.</p>\n<p>After voting against funding the CSA, the Senate voted to approve investments made by the Investment Advisory Committee. The IAC manages the Associated Student’s stock holdings and monitors different companies to decide when to sell and when to invest to make a profit for the student budget. Senators were generally supportive of the IAC’s decisions, but one company’s past legal issues concerned certain members.</p>\n<p>Proxy Senator Will Ellis brought up the potential issues with Kansas City Southern as an investment because of their legal past.</p>\n<p>“[There was a] race-based discrimination lawsuit filed against KCS,” he said. “It’s cool that we got that money [from that investment], but [the suit] should make us reluctant to invest in that company.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alex Choate countered that the suit had been dealt with and was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“Since this issue was resolved, I’d feel comfortable investing in it as long as we make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Senate voted to approve all investments; however, they resolved to keep an eye on KCS in order to prevent association with discriminatory companies.</p>\n<p>In addition, External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia proposed an initiative to provide taxicab rides to students who did not have immediate access to appropriate fare. He said they would need to set up a $5,000 account with the Yellow Cab.</p>\n<p>“It would be a revolving account,” Siordia said. “Students would give the taxi driver their perm number, address, et cetera and then the cab ride would be paid for with [the Yellow Cab account]. [That money would then be] taken from the student’s BARC account and given back to the Yellow Cab fund.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial affairs debated in the meeting, Senators passed changes to the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee’s legal code, the Women’s Committee presented plans to offer regular self-defense classes in the near future and executive officers celebrated the implementation of Proposition 30.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48718\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48718\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/","id":3098,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3097,3096,3095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Election Bill Veto Sparks Controversy in A.S.

President Harrison Weber’s veto of the organization’s amended Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Weber struck the bill down after the representatives unanimously voted in its favor last week on the grounds that many of its provisions — such as a ban on A.S. officials’ candidate endorsements — violated First Amendment rights. The committee modifies the code every year to ensure fair and equitable campaigning for students interested in running in elections during Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Weber, campus legal counsel Nancy G. Hamill also flagged certain legal ramifications in the new Elections Code that could potentially face legal challenge if the veto is overridden.</p>\n<p>“I did not want to do a veto, [and] I believe a veto should not be thrown around like it’s not a big deal,” Weber said. “But things like the Elections Committee exist for a reason — and the veto exists for a reason, and I felt there were some things that really needed to be addressed.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Elections Committee Chair Courtney Axner said the council supports an override of the veto without further alterations by a two-thirds vote of the council.</p>\n<p>“We support him fully, and I think he is a great President, [but] in all honesty we’re just … trying to work the process out,” Axner said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ban unnecessarily prevents officials from favoring candidates, Weber said.</p>\n<p>“The endorsement question does not have any legitimate educational purpose because students are only told what certain officials think of candidates,” Weber said. “Student-Advocate General endorsements are only as good as the credibility behind the endorsement. It is not just like a rubber stamp that says: you got my endorsement, you got the position.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, the endorsements help prevent the election of “an outside person without any regulation [who] can do damage to the office and the services it provides.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Marlene Moreno said biased endorsements may sway voters and create an unequal arena for candidates without connections in the association.</p>\n<p>“[The] Student Advocate General should not be able to endorse views because [Weber] has a very idealistic view that a hundred percent of the students will know what a Student General does,” Moreno said. “I have faith in students but people will take titles at face value.”</p>\n<p>Weber also requested the committee clarify its ambiguous definition of “defamation” and what constitutes “offensive or inappropriate” language as well as re-evaluate its restriction of the campaigning period to two weeks due to its possible limitation on free speech.</p>\n<p>However, Axner said candidates’ unique position as students and politicians requires extra consideration.</p>\n<p>“Nationally, presidents can campaign whenever they want, but our concern is that we are students first before we are any elected position,” Axner said. “By [establishing a] limited two-week period of campaigning, it gives students ample time to say ‘I’m a student first, and then the two weeks I’m going to work really hard for the position I want.’”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nate Walker said the Council should take Weber’s recommendations into consideration to avoid placing itself in a legal dispute.</p>\n<p>“I trust that if we make rational amendments to the bill that are in the interest in the students, Harrison will not veto it again,” Walker said. “We let the veto go through, we put this in old-business, we make all amendments and add in the Elections Code verbiage.”</p>\n<p>The issue remained unresolved as of press time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44716\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44716\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/election-bill-veto-sparks-controversy-session/","id":3099,"author":{"id":201,"name":"Christine Cha"},"related":[3098,3097,3096],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
