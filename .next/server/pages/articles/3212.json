The Loco Rewards program is an incentivizing campaign to get students more involved in UCSB athletics.</p>\n<p>For the price of under $10 per quarter, this year-long program involves multiple free giveaways, beginning with one soccer-themed and one basketball-themed T-shirt. This is the same style T-shirt that has been given out at the first men’s soccer game in previous years.</p>\n<p>Like in years past, the shirt will be gold, and if you wear it certain on days, there will be deals in participating Isla Vista restaurants to receive either free or discounted items.</p>\n<p>In addition, the rewards program includes free bus rides and admission to the away Cal Poly soccer game and the Big West Basketball Tournament.</p>\n<p>As a rewards program, the more events students attend, the more points they will accumulate, resulting in a chance to win unique prizes such as iPads, flat-screen TVs and Nike apparel.</p>\n<p>With all of these incentives along with game-day giveaways, any student who is part of the Loco Rewards program will surely receive more value out of the program than the monetary amount they put in at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>The vision of the athletic department is not only to increase attendance at UCSB athletic events, but to expand student enthusiasm and unity, as was displayed at the UCLA game.</p>\n<p>For example, in the glory days of UCSB basketball when the Gauchos defeated No. 1 UNLV, the Thunderdome was the place to be. Glimpses of this energetic atmosphere certainly have occurred in the last two to three years, such as against Long Beach State or Cal Poly, but we would hope this rewards program would help to bring back this fervor at UCSB athletic events.</p>\n<p>Even by attending one or two events, such as a softball game or a water polo match, students will have an opportunity to win worthwhile prizes. They will not be exclusively for the students who attend the most events, like the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, as students we have the privilege of attending all UCSB athletic events for free. For most schools, Associated Students cover the cost of student tickets in their budget, but UCSB Athletics bears the burden here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>At several institutions, students even pay to attend sporting events such as basketball games. Here, the UCSB athletic department provides the student body with 35,000 free tickets each year for a $350,000 value.</p>\n<p>The first men’s soccer game after students return to Isla Vista will be against Stanford on Sept. 27, where the attendance is expected to be over 10,000. This will be the biggest opportunity to be a part of the Loco Rewards program.</p>\n<p>As students, we want to bring awareness and gain more UCSB student’s perspectives on this program. Let us know what you think and leave a comment online. After all, it is a program for the students.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51534\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51534\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/","id":3212,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3211,3210,3209],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Mariano Rivera Proving To Excel Despite Age","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When Yankees manager Joe Girardi is preparing for bed at the end of the night, he makes a phone call to one of his employees to prepare a fine bottle of wine.

It is always the same bottle; it has one taste and only one taste. Yet this taste is the greatest in history, and it has gotten better with age. As you may have guessed, I am not actually talking about wine. I am bringing up the striking comparison between Yankees closer Mariano Rivera and a fine bottle of wine.</p>\n<p>Girardi’s bottle of wine’s unique taste is actually Rivera’s only pitch: his dominating cutter. The bottle of wine’s greatest taste in history refers to the fact that Rivera is the all-time save leader with 624. Rivera has also gotten better with age. After tearing his ACL shagging fly balls in batting practice last season, Rivera is a perfect 16 for 16 in save opportunities this season at the age of 43.</p>\n<p>The Yankees are holding down first place in the AL East despite the injuries to Derek Jeter, Curtis Granderson, Mark Teixeira, and Alex Rodriguez. What is holding them afloat is surely Rivera’s dominance and the resurgence of castoffs like Travis Hafner, Vernon Wells, and Kevin Youkilis. Unfortunately, Rivera announced in March that he will be retiring after this season. Rivera’s retirement, Jeter’s lengthy disabled list stint and the retirement of longtime catcher Jorge Posada mean we are seeing the end of an era in New York.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This season has become Rivera’s farewell tour, just as last year was Chipper Jones’s. Rivera will certainly be on the American League All-Star team this season, but this year’s game might have a twist. There is a movement circulating the baseball world to make Rivera the starting pitcher of this year’s game. We have seen such honorable gestures at the midsummer classic before. You might remember in the 2001 game, Alex Rodriguez moved over to third base to allow Cal Ripken Jr. to return to short stop. Ripken played short stop for most of his career, and Rodriguez’s gesture was a nice touch in Ripken’s final season.</p>\n<p>However, I am against starting Rivera. Pitchers, and especially closers, are creatures of habit. Starting Rivera would most likely affect his performance. It would be a shame to see him struggle on national TV, and it could also affect his mindset when he returns to the Yankees bullpen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/","id":3209,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3208,3207,3206],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kobe Bryant: Down But Not Out","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  For the past 17 years, the world’s best basketball players have asked the same question.

The unthinkable happened. The 34 year old maestro, the five-time champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist, the man with the fourth most points in NBA history sat on the floor of the Staples Center holding his foot. You could see a grimace on his face that most Laker fans have learned to ignore.</p>\n<p>He’s going to get up. He’s going to go to the free throw line, knock down two clutch free throws, get back on defense and get us through this game. He might even limp.</p>\n<p>He did what most of us expected. He came out of the timeout, walked to the free throw line, and he made two free throws to tie the game with just over three minutes remaining. Only this time, he didn’t get back on defense. His eyes were red. It was obvious he was holding back tears. He limped off the court and into the locker room. The result was a torn Achilles tendon.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has pushed his body to its physical limits year after year. He has been described as more than just a basketball player, but a warrior, and often regarded as the toughest player in the NBA.</p>\n<p>So, how fitting then that the only weakness of the legendary, indestructible warrior Achilles would be the only thing that could stop the greatest warrior of this era.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, nothing made sense in Lakerland.</p>\n<p>After two depressing years in which the previously top of the world Lakers were run out of the second round of the playoffs, one of the greatest franchises in basketball had seemingly found its way back to the top by acquiring future hall of famer Steve Nash and the most dominant big man in basketball in Dwight Howard.</p>\n<p>However, the dream quickly turned into a nightmare. After a 1-4 start to a year that was supposed to be one of the greatest in the team’s glorious history, the Lakers found themselves in disarray.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to January. The Lakers are 17-25 and Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard continue to miss games with various injuries. The only constant, as he has been since 1996, is Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Then, something changed, and the Lakers started to win. Kobe would go on to have one of his greatest seasons ever, averaging over 27 points a game for the ninth time in his career, tying his career high with 6 assists per game, and shooting the ball more efficiently than he has in years.</p>\n<p>Kobe hit the winning shot against the Hawks in a must-win game. Three days later, he brought his team back from down 25 points at New Orleans, a game where his teammates once again failed to play with the fire needed to make the playoffs.</p>\n<p>He followed it up two nights later with miraculous shot after miraculous shot against Toronto, ending in another game-winning shot.</p>\n<p>With five games left in the season, Kobe vowed not to come off the court again. If the Lakers won their remaining games, they would clinch a playoff spot, something that seemed unreachable three months earlier.</p>\n<p>The Lakers won one game. The next night, they played in the Rose Garden in Portland, an arena they rarely win in. In 48 minutes, Kobe had 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four block shots, and three steals, becoming the first player to ever put up a stat line like that.</p>\n<p>With three games remaining, the Lakers returned home to play the Golden State Warriors. They trailed for most of the game, but with just minutes left they still had a chance. Kobe nailed a deep jumper to bring the Lakers within three with under five minutes to go.</p>\n<p>A minute later, he took a classic “Kobe shot:” a deep, 29-foot, stand-still three to tie the game with a defender in his face. He made it.</p>\n<p>The next time he touched the ball, he made his final move, one that after the game he said he’s made “a million times.” He had played every minute of every game for almost three weeks, but on this night, his body gave out on him.</p>\n<p>The Lakers would go on to win their remaining games and make it to the playoffs, where they were swept by the much superior San Antonio Spurs.</p>\n<p>Kobe underwent successful surgery to repair his achilles, and was originally diagnosed as out six to nine months. Many players never come back from this injury, and those that do have found it very difficult to perform at a high level.</p>\n<p>If there’s anyone that can do it, though, it’s Kobe Bryant. While the numbers of his dwindling number of peers who played in the ‘90s, such as Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan and Steve Nash, have fallen steadily, Kobe has somehow kept his production consistent.</p>\n<p>If there’s anything his teary-eyed interview which directly followed his injury tells us, it’s how much he cares. The undeniable, unbreakable emotion is still there. The fire, will and inhuman competitive spirit is still there.</p>\n<p>Every doubter that he’s ever had, he’s silenced. He’s stepped up to every challenge he’s been faced with since joining the league at the age of 17. In 2003, someone said that his daughter was a better shooter than Kobe. The Mamba answered that by breaking the NBA record with 12 three-pointers in a single game, a record that still stands today.</p>\n<p>That’s just who he is. He won’t stop fighting because he doesn’t know how. He already has a head-start on the recovery process by studying from the fastest recoveries from this dreaded injury and promising to “do it better.” He’s shooting for a return to the court by the end of October, the start of what just might be his final season.</p>\n<p>He will prove the doubters wrong again. He will come back not as a shell of his former self, but as formidable a force as he has ever been.

This vote came a little over a week after the relocation committee had unanimously recommended the team stay in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Maloofs settled on the Sacramento group to take the reins and has signed a deal.</p>\n<p>The team from the Pacific Northwest is being sold for an NBA record $535 million. Vivek Ranadive, the head of the new ownership, will purchase the 65 percent share currently owned by the Maloofs and their business partner, Robert Hernreich. Nevertheless, the Maloofs are in so much debt, owing approximately $150 million to the city of Sacramento and the NBA, that they will receive about $200 million.</p>\n<p>One clear advantage Sacramento seemed to have in gaining the relocation committee’s recommendation is the continued support and loyalty for the Kings since it came to Sacramento in 1985.</p>\n<p>With 19 sellout seasons, the Kings own one of the longest streaks in NBA history. But even more than that, the fans have shown incredible support during the time when the team was vulnerable and the team’s future was unknown.</p>\n<p>Taking the slogans of “Here We Buy” and “Here we Stay,” Sacramento fans were going to make it difficult to have their team stolen away. On Feb. 9, Kings fans orchestrated a “Here We Buy” night, selling out the arena with more than 16,000 fans to watch the Kings beat the Utah Jazz. For a not so great team to sell out against another mediocre team in Utah, now that’s dedication. And after the game, fans stayed put, rallying and not giving up.</p>\n<p>Then, during the Board of Governors meeting, Sacramento paid to have a 30-second ad supporting the city’s bid to keep the Kings playing every five minutes in Times Square.</p>\n<p>Even as the season came to an end, fans didn’t let up. After the final game of the season against the Clippers, fans once again didn’t leave their seats, staying an hour after the game with chants of “Here We Stay” and “Sacramento.” It was all that could be talked about, even in the Clippers broadcast post-game show.</p>\n<p>Leading the show though for Sacramento has been Mayor Kevin Johnson. And really, he hasn’t been given enough credit for what he’s put together in such a short amount of time. The retired Phoenix Suns guard had to act fast and with efficiency to combat a strong bid from Seattle.</p>\n<p>And even when it seemed all hope was gone and NBA Commissioner David Stern had announced Sacramento’s offer was nothing close to that of Seattle’s, Johnson continued to work around the clock. He’s been part of putting together the arena deal and of course was monumental in pitching everything to the committee. If there’s one guy who Sacramento owes a few extra thank you’s to, it is without a doubt Johnson.</p>\n<p>The deal is arguably the best possible scenario for the Kings. They get rid of the horrible owners, get fresh faces, a new start and remain in a city that loves them.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the team might be becoming free of the Maloofs, who have owned the majority interest in the team since 1999. In the last year, the Maloof name has become known like a cuss word or even have become used as verb meaning “to mess up.”</p>\n<p>The people that were once loved by the city and known for attending every Kings game have been MIA for a while now. They are clearly broke, which should’ve been obvious the second they could no longer afford the cheaper WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.</p>\n<p>At that time, they also began their lying, which has continued up until the team was sold. When the team was unanimously recommended to stay in California’s capital city, the Maloofs threatened to keep the Kings unless relocation was approved and they could sell to the Hansen and Ballmer group, only to announce how pleased they were to sell to the Sacramento group after relocation was denied.</p>\n<p>In addition, Ranadive becomes the first Indian-born owner in the NBA’s history. He already has ownership experience as part of the group that bought the Golden State Warriors and as a result was involved in building their arena.</p>\n<p>With Ranadive’s background, the Kings could also open up a new way of marketing the NBA globally, as the NBA is looking into reaching India.</p>\n<p>While the Maloofs certainly needed to go, the next person to be dismissed will probably be general manager Geoff Petrie. His contract is up and, to be honest, he should’ve been given the boot years ago. The only problem was that the Maloofs were too blind to see it.</p>\n<p>For years, Petrie has slacked doing his job, giving away all the players from the glory days and getting nothing in return. Sacramento fans, you can thank Petrie for the fact that your team has been battling to stay out of the cellar in the Western Conference. He may have been brilliant at one time, bringing in Chris Webber and Bibby and the great Kings we all know, but ever since, he’s been almost worthless.</p>\n<p>Although Head Coach Keith Smart still has one year left on his contract, he is also likely to be dismissed, leaving a fresh start for the Kings, which is exactly what it needs. Finally, there is hope to returning to the glory days. The team is not only very young, but well under the salary gap and therefore will have plenty of money to bring in some talent.</p>\n<p>Finally, the last thing the Kings will get with the deal is a brand new arena. Arco Arena (for true fans it will never be anything else) is a loved building in Sacramento, but seeing some of the newer arenas around the NBA, it really is in bad shape. The Kings’ future includes a $447 million downtown arena that will be built at the western gateway to the city near the Sacramento River.</p>\n<p>Seattle does absolutely deserve a team. There’s no arguing that. Those fans were also very loyal to their team and had it taken away, but they just can’t have ours.</p>\n<p>The best option would be expansion. Throughout the battle for the Kings, Stern was adamant that there would be no expansion, but it is a logical idea. Seattle would get its team and there are plenty of other viable cities that could be picked from to round out the NBA to a total of 32 teams. That would mean two conferences of 16 teams and four divisions of four teams. Half the teams make the playoffs, half don’t. It all makes sense.</p>\n<p>Of course, now that the deal is done, Stern has praised Seattle’s proposal and is saying that the league might consider expansion if a new TV deal could be made. Stern covered his back keeping another team from relocating under his reign. To expand would be another possible positive action he could take before retiring next year.</p>\n<p>Besides, if the Kings had relocated, they would’ve become the SuperSonics and the entire history of Sacramento would disappear.</p>\n<p>So live on the great memories in Sacramento — the cowbells being so loud that opposing teams hated playing in Sacramento and the great rivalry between the Kings and Lakers. Live on the legacies of the great players that have played there — Mitch Richmond, Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic, Bobby Jackson, Doug Christie, Chris Webber and Vlade Divac. And live on the idea that the Sacramento Kings could one day win a NBA championship.</p>\n<p>For people like me and all the people in Sacramento, this is our team and they are finally here to stay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of My 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/","id":3211,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3210,3209,3208],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
