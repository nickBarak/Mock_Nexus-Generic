owner Matt Metzka. The Babais have been doing restoration work inside the restaurant and will be opening the restaurant tomorrow at 11 p.m. as “Founders Family” Giovanni’s Pizza Isla Vista, with a grand opening from January 29 to 31.</p>\n<p>Debra Babai said the staff will remain the same as it was before the temporary closing, but the new managers will be Indres Govender and Carrie Leonard. Danny Babai said the ownership change was due to confidential reasons.</p>\n<p>“We took it back from the franchisee — it was confidential but we had to get it back,” Danny Babai said. “We hired back all the people who used to work here.”</p>\n<p>Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza has operated in the Santa Barbara area since 1979. According to a statement from the Babais, Danny Babai opened the first Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza on State Street in 1979 and continues overseeing the business. Garrett Gruendyke, one of Danny’s sons, has owned and run an additional location, Giovanni’s Pizza on the Mesa, since 2009.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista, Tuesday evening in the I.V. Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Participants discussed the use of a $126,000 budget for committees and services outlined in Das William’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to make I.V., currently an unincorporated area, into a CSD. The selected services, which will be aided by a $200,000 pledge by UCSB after the CSD is created, will be sent to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for approval and placed on the 2016 ballot for voters to a decide on an eight percent utility users tax. The services to be sent to LAFCO are the Municipal Advisory Council, the Tenant Mediation Program, the Area Planning Commission, a parking district, police protection services, community facilities, sidewalks, lighting, gutters, trees and graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>George Thurlow, Alumni Affairs Office assistant vice chancellor, said although the pledged funds will not be available until after the CSD is created, it should still be included in the report to LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion would be that you come up with a wish list for two years, 2017 and 2018, a $200,000 budget for each one and decide which projects and programs you want to fund,” Thurlow said. “Put that in front of LAFCO because they’re going to be criticizing [that] it’s not enough money or good enough services.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus, said the term “police protection services” should be defined before deciding on an alternative community policing program that would cost $75,000.</p>\n<p>“To me, it could be contracting law enforcement to host a few self-defense classes every quarter,” Schunk said. “That to me is contracting for additional law enforcement services and that activates that power just fine, and we also have a contract.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said contracting more law enforcement officers from Santa Barbara County or UC Police Department (UCPD) would “tie” the CSD to the police collaborative board.</p>\n<p>“I just wonder whether or not contracting with them is getting actual on-the-job police services or contracting something small like liaison work,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Pargin, second-year math major, said it would be more beneficial to get additional police services from UCPD because it would come out of the university’s budget instead of the CSD’s budget.</p>\n<p>The collaborative program is based on the S.N.A.P. program at Cal Poly which hires students to be first responders and provide campus warnings. Since the university does not want to expand the CSO program into I.V., the contracting cadets would not be UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliot, community organizer from Das Williams’ office, said the CSD could replicate S.N.A.P., but will not be an extension of the program.</p>\n<p>“They could work with student groups with whatever project they’re working on,” Elliot said. “These cadets do not carry weapons and are in training to eventually become officers. It would be better because they would learn to respond without weapons and have training that didn’t incorporate immediate arresting.”</p>\n<p>Jonathon Abboud, Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus, said it would be best to fund as many services as possible through LAFCO’s approval and distribute $200,000 in UCSB pledge funds afterwards.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually better and more effective in the long term with the money we have instead of spreading the budget out way too thin where you couldn’t do that much per year,” Abboud said. “I think it’s a much more prudent approach to LAFCO where you’ve already thought of eight percent.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/","id":4581,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4580,4579,4578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Safety Concerns and Issues Discussed at  Latest IVRPD Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last Thursday, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District convened with community members for its weekly meeting, addressing a number of upcoming local civic projects and concerns.

There was also debate of other local issues, particularly concerning I.V., such as discussion of ongoing maintenance and restoration efforts at Anisq’Oyo’ Park, updates on the current fence project initiated by the Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs and plans to potentially implement laws requiring all dogs in I.V. to be leashed.</p>\n<p>In regards to issues of street lighting, Soutar said civic groups have been seeking adequate funding to install more street lamps in the local community. According to Soutar, there is statistical evidence that additional lighting is necessary since much of I.V.’s crime is concentrated in more poorly lit areas.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get $100,000 to do lighting in Isla Vista, and this is going to be going before the Board of Supervisors,” Soutar said. “They did some crime statistics … between El Nido, Pasado, Del Playa, all the way to Camino Corto is the bulk of, you know, where the crime happens.”</p>\n<p>Although installation of new street lamps across Isla Vista would cost approximately $300,000, attaining this initial $100,000 grant would at least allow groups to install of lamps in the most crime-ridden portions of the community.</p>\n<p>In another attempt to make Isla Vista safer, IVRPD met with county officials at Walter Capps Park to receive final approval for the Associated Students EVPLA fence project.</p>\n<p>The Board also discussed progress on Anisq’Oyo’ Park’s pond maintenance and restoration, announcing that rebuilding plans for the park’s stage have been approved by the Planning and Development Department of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>General Manager of IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the park recently received flowers as a donation from Santa Barbara Water Garden.</p>\n<p>“[They] donated about one hundred water hyacinths, which are now split between the front and the back pond,” Gould said. “What those will do, they’ll help filter out a lot of the muck that’s in the water.”</p>\n<p>Lotusland also contributed to the pond’s restoration by donating 50 to 100 plants for growth in the enclosure, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Gould suggested the district of Isla Vista adopt a series of leash laws, similar to those of Santa Barbara County, in order to waive the district’s liability for off-leash dog attacks. Gould said until I.V. implements these policies, it will continue to be responsible for these incidents.</p>\n<p>“In the County of Santa Barbara, all of their parks have leash laws. They post a leash-free zone, and that sort of protects them a little bit,” Gould said. “In the meantime, we don’t have any protections. We don’t have leash laws in any of our parks.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD meetings are open to the public and held on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 4th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/","id":4582,"author":{"id":204,"name":"Adam Courtin"},"related":[4581,4580,4579],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
