Shaw has experienced tremendous success as both a player and a coach throughout his career and will now take over a promising young Nuggets’ squad that finished third in the Western Conference last season with 57 wins.</p>\n<p>A native of Oakland, CA, Shaw transferred to UCSB after two seasons at Saint Mary’s College and immediately established himself as one of the best ever to don a Gaucho uniform. Shaw played two seasons at UCSB from 1986-1988 garnering All-Big West honors both seasons. In his senior season, Shaw was named Big West Player of the Year and was also an All-American en route to leading UCSB to its first ever NCAA tournament in 1988.</p>\n<p>Shaw impressed scouts during his time at UCSB and was the Boston Celtics first round draft pick (24th overall) in the 1988 NBA Draft. During his 14-year playing career in the NBA, Shaw played both point and shooting guard for seven different teams. His best statistical season came in his second year in the NBA, when Shaw averaged 13.8 points, 7.6 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 79 starts for the Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps Shaw’s most memorable moments in the NBA came during his final four seasons in the league, which he spent with the Los Angeles Lakers. Shaw helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA titles from 2000-2002, playing alongside greats such as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Aside from his professional career in the NBA, Shaw also won a gold medal at the 1986 FIBA World Championships playing for the US national team.</p>\n<p>Following his retirement from the NBA in 2003, Shaw immediately began to work towards a career as a coach, scouting for the Lakers for a season before becoming an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2005-2011. Shaw won two additional championships as an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2009-2010, bringing his NBA title count to five.</p>\n<p>Before accepting the head coaching job with the Nuggets, Shaw spent the previous two seasons as the associate head coach for the Indiana Pacers and helped develop young players such as Roy Hibbert and Paul George. This past season, Shaw tutored fellow Gaucho Orlando Johnson during Johnson’s rookie season in the NBA in which the Pacers fell to the eventual champion Miami Heat in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals showdown.</p>\n<p>After 14 seasons as a player and eight seasons as an assistant coach, Shaw will finally get to show the NBA why he has been such a commodity on the coaching market the previous four seasons. Shaw replaces the reigning NBA Coach of the Year in George Karl and inherits a young and talented Nuggets’ roster highlighted by players including Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried and Andre Iguodala.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best player in UCSB history, Shaw continues to sculpt his basketball legacy and will look to have the same success as a head coach that he has had at every stop throughout his impressive career.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"51736\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/ucsb-professors-elected-to-join-ecological-society-of-america/shaw-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,282\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Shaw 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-51736\" alt=\"Shaw 2\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=312%2C169\" width=\"312\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the June 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Taylor as the primary option in the backcourt to go along with rising sophomore Duke DaRe, who received a large amount of playing time at the end of last season.</p>\n<p>Headlining the three new recruits is Zalmico Harmon, a 6’0” point guard coming from Ventura College, where he led the Pirates to the postseason and received First Team All-State honors.</p>\n<p>“His maturity, physically and mentally, is definitely something we need on our team,” Stock said. “That gives him a great chance to make an impact.”</p>\n<p>Along with Harmon, UCSB’s recruiting class includes another point guard in Eric Childress from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, CA. Childress was named First Team All-CIF as well as Bay League Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Eric is a true point guard where he’s a pass-first point guard,” Stock said. “He has great poise and maturity for his age. He’s definitely a guy that will be a huge asset.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class for the Gauchos is 6’10” forward Alex Hart from Kelowna, British Columbia in Canada. Hart averaged over 35 points per game in his senior season for Immaculata Catholic Regional High School and was a member of British Columbia’s U-17 team.</p>\n<p>“The unique thing about Alex is the fact that he can stretch the floor with his shooting ability,” Stock said. “He can stretch the defense and give Al the chance to pound it inside.”</p>\n<p>These three recruits will join a talented roster that includes First Team All-Big West selection in rising junior center Alan Williams, along with the Big West Best Sixth Player of the Year in rising senior guard Kyle Boswell. Rising sophomores in guards John Green and Michael Bryson, as well as forward Taran Brown, are also expected to contribute heavily for another youthful UCSB squad next season.</p>\n<p>“I think all three of [the recruits] have a chance to have an impact,” Stock said. “They all bring such different things to the table and definitely address different needs we have on our team.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51516\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51516\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/","id":630,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[629,628,627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball: New Look, Same Style","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basketball-photo_photo-courtesy-of-Ramon-Ravirosa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basketball-photo_photo-courtesy-of-Ramon-Ravirosa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At this time last year, the UCSB women’s basketball team was coming off a Big West Championship and NCAA postseason berth with almost the entire team returning for this season.

You don’t get to the NCAA in year one. And any time you can be one of 64 or 180 teams playing in postseason play, you have to feel good about that for the future.”</p>\n<p>With the season over, Mitchell has been busy recruiting as she loses three incredibly important seniors in the program to graduation in guard Angelei Aguirre, center Kirsten Tilleman and forward Sweets Underwood.</p>\n<p>Three of the top four leaders in minutes for Santa Barbara this season were its seniors, with all starting at least 30 of the 33 games. Underwood led the team in scoring at 12.2 points per game and, combined with Tilleman, dominated the boards for UCSB, grabbing 9.2 and 7.1 rebounds, respectively. Tilleman led the team in steals with 1.0 per game, while Aguirre led the team in blocks with 0.7 per game.</p>\n<p>“They all led in different ways and had different roles,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, it’s always hard to replace players that have played a lot of minutes because we always know that experience will trump talent.”</p>\n<p>Losing their entire starting frontline, the obvious need for UCSB going into next year is height. The Gauchos have typically been undersized, but Mitchell, who was Rutgers University’s recruiting coordinator for seven years and was known for consistently bringing in the top talent in the nation, seems to have answered the call.</p>\n<p>“I think (last season) the lack of size caught up with us,” Mitchell said. “We all know that against Poly in the semifinals, it was size (that cost us). Hopefully we’ve addressed that with recruiting.”</p>\n<p>The look of the team should be very different next year with five recruits, two transfers and three freshmen coming to Santa Barbara and one more possible recruit in the works.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit is junior forward Hillary Drinovsky. At 6’3’’, Drinovsky signs with UCSB after playing last season for Central Arizona College, which posted a 32-2 record, earning a trip to the NJCAA National Championship Game.</p>\n<p>Coming from New Jersey, Mitchell is familiar with Drinovsky, working with her in middle school when she attended basketball camps at Rutgers.</p>\n<p>Last season, Drinovsky only averaged 2.7 points per game, but shot 45.7 percent from the field and averaged 0.8 blocks per game. She’s known as a more defensive player with a blue-collar mentality. For anyone that’s familiar with UCSB women’s basketball, Drinovsky personifies a lot of the characteristics of Tilleman.</p>\n<p>“One hundred percent that’s the best way to describe her (is like Tilleman), besides the fact that she’s legit 6’3’’ or 6’4’’, so she’s a big strong body,” Mitchell said. “She played on a very successful junior college team. That tells me right away she’s played against elite-level competition. She took a unique route to get to UCSB, so she’s got a bit of a chip on her shoulder and things to prove, but she’ll be the closest in exemplifying our personality and work ethic in the same way that Tilleman did.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s other transfer also comes to UCSB with a lot of experience. Junior Kristine Brance played her first two years at nationally-ranked Chipola College in Florida. Helping the team to the Elite Eight at the NJCAA Woman’s National Basketball Tournament, Brance earned Second Team All-Tournament honors.</p>\n<p>Originally from Riga, Latvia, the 5’7’’ guard also played for her national team during the U20 2011 European Championships. Now coming to Santa Barbara, Brance brings offense to a defensive-minded UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>Brance was the Indians second-leading scorer last season, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field, 36 percent from behind the arc, and a team-best 85 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“Anytime you can bring in an international kid, they have high basketball IQs,” Mitchell said. “She played on a junior college team that didn’t lose a lot of games. You want kids that refuse to lose. Kristine can play multiple positions and give us a three-point threat.”</p>\n<p>As junior college players transferring, both Drinovsky and Brance are expected to make an immediate impact for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“With Hillary and Kristine, we got some hidden talent. I think some people knew about them but I think they’ll be players that in the Big West can make a big-time impact,” Mitchell said. “The programs that they were at automatically give them leadership qualities that are hard to get from freshmen that are just trying to find their way through the college lifestyle.”</p>\n<p>Also giving UCSB more height is 6’2’’ freshman Melissa Maragnes of St. Monica High School. In her senior year, Maragnes earned Division IV All-CIF honors, averaging 9.9 points per game, second on the team. She also tallied 8.7 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and 1.6 assists per game, leading her team to the third round of the CIF State Girls Basketball Championships. Maragnes also owns the Mariners’ single-season blocked shots record with 60.</p>\n<p>“Melissa is going to give us a lot of what Sweets gave — a big-time athlete,” Mitchell said. “She has the ability to put the ball on the floor and attack the rim. She gives us a defensive presence as a shot blocker, but she also runs the floor like a guard. She’s just an athlete that is skillful around the basket, a great rebounder, and gives us some athleticism on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Onome Jemerigbe also comes from a high school team that knows how to win. Playing for St. Mary’s High School, the 5’6” point guard helped her team to a 32-3 overall and 10-0 league record. The team was ranked No. 7 in California and No. 14 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Onome is lighting-quick end-to-end and is that guard that is going to give point guards nightmares,” Mitchell said. “She has a pass-first, shoot-second mentality and she’ll be able to get in the gaps and create for others.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Mitchell’s last recruit for next year is freshman Mi’Chael Wright, who at 5’11’’ will play the forward position for the Gauchos. During her senior season at Chaminade High School, Wright led the Eagles to a 30-4 overall record while going 9-1 in conference play. She averaged 12.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.6 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“The best way I can probably describe her is a lot like Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “She played the power forward in high school, but she has the ability to handle it well enough that at some point we’ll make her a wing player because she does shoot it well and is a great line driver. She just has that blue-collar mentality; just about every game she found a way to get a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Next season, these recruits will join several veteran players for UCSB, including senior guards Destini Mason, Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s going to be a different look for us,” Mitchell said. “We want to open it up more. With Nick, Destini and Onome, you have guards that can create their own shots and create for others. And then we have shooters, like Mel and Christine. I think this is a team with more speed and quickness that we can press an aggressive press, not just a tempo press.”</p>\n<p>Of course, no matter the players, there’s always one thing that will stay the same with Mitchell at the helm: the focus will be defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Ramon Ravirosa</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/","id":631,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[630,629,628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finding Strength in the Face of Adversity","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_0955.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/WomensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_0955.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Only the strong survive.” For UCSB women’s basketball player Sweets Underwood, it’s an adage that sticks with her every day.

Three years earlier, she had lost her father to a heart attack. Her aunt and uncle took her in, but then this past year, tragedy struck again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last November, Underwood’s uncle passed away and the saying became even more significant in her life.</p>\n<p>“It’s something my aunt and uncle would always say,” Underwood said. “[They] took me in at a really young age after I lost my mom and of course you go into depression. Things happen, but it’s up to you to push on and in this world, only the strong survive, so that’s something that was instilled in me at a very young age and I’ve stuck with it ever since.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hardship in Underwood’s life, there was one person who continued to push her. And that person was Head Coach Carlene Mitchell.</p>\n<p>“I told her that sometimes I felt basketball had been the easiest thing in her life,” Mitchell said. “I made it extremely hard for her. Once she said she wanted a chance to play at the next level, I knew there was no way I could let her slide by with things that by human nature you would want to with a kid of her background.”</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of her two-year reign in Santa Barbara, Mitchell has been saying that Underwood should average a double-double on the floor every night.</p>\n<p>This season, she basically did.</p>\n<p>Compared to only eight double-doubles in her first three years at UCSB, the senior forward recorded 12 this season, averaging 12.2 points and 9.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“We allowed her to see mismatches and with her athletic ability, there was no reason she couldn’t (average a double-double),” Mitchell said. “I think she started enjoying the fact that when a big shot needed to be made, she was confident enough in herself that she was willing to put that burden on her shoulders.”</p>\n<p>Underwood’s mental toughness clearly translates onto the court. Strength is echoed in Underwood’s play as she emerged as not only a consistent player, but a leader for UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>“She never backs down and she never lets anything get to her,” senior center and co-captain Kirsten Tilleman said. “No matter what goes on on the court, she’s going to be consistently working hard.”</p>\n<p>A team captain, Underwood wears No. 1, taking the number after becoming the first girl from Centennial High to earn a NCAA Division I  basketball scholarship in 20 years. With Underwood as its leader, the team also won its first league championship.</p>\n<p>The number has come to suit the Compton, CA native well as she became UCSB’s leader this season. She was the only player to start in every game this season for the Gauchos and averaged a team-high 33.1 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely good to have that consistent presence,” Tilleman said. “We knew what we were going to get from Sweets every night and that was something we were able to fall back on a lot.”</p>\n<p>Leading the team in points, rebounds and field goal percentage, Underwood becomes the first player to lead the team in all three categories since Jenna Green during the 2006-07 season.</p>\n<p>As a result, the accolades came rolling in for Underwood. She was named to the 2012-13 All-Big West First Team and earned Big West Player of the Week four times, a program record.</p>\n<p>“In the end, she got the ultimate of being recognized by the coaches in this conference as an all-conference player,” Mitchell said. “All the accolades [are] well deserved. She worked hard on her game.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Underwood was crucial in helping the team have an inside presence, allowing the team to play an inside-out game. She could knock down the elbow jumper or post up down low and make the tough layups over bigger defenders.</p>\n<p>Her 12.2 points per game and 48.1 percent shooting from the field ranked eighth and third in the Big West, respectively. She also shot 75.9 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“[As for] scoring, most nights we had to have her on the court to have a chance to win,” Mitchell said. “She has long arms and she’s a quick leaper, so her athleticism kind of countered the fact that she’s undersized. Also, she’s quick on the dribble, so she could face up larger post players and exploit their weaknesses off the dribble.”</p>\n<p>Underwood was just as important on the defensive end, anchoring UCSB’s defense and often making the much-needed plays, whether that was tipping the ball out of bounds with 0.7 seconds remaining to secure UCSB a road victory or grabbing 16 rebounds at Pacific in what was probably the team’s best game of the year.</p>\n<p>Although she measures in at just 6’0’’, Underwood ranked fourth in the Big West in rebounding with 9.2 rebounds per game and first in conference play in defensive boards with 6.8 per contest. Against Northridge Feb. 23, Underwood was all over the glass, tallying a career-high 20 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Defense was] our team identity. Our mentality was to get stops and a defensive possession isn’t over until you seal that rebound,” Underwood said. “My mentality was to be extremely aggressive on the boards. I wanted that to be my identity.”</p>\n<p>In Underwood’s final game of the year, she recorded another career-high, proving once again she can play through adversity. She exploded for 23 points against San Diego State in the first round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament, marking the second time she had broken her career-high this season. The game was especially important for Underwood after finishing with a season-low four points in a loss to Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“The basketball gods recognized what this kid had given to the program and they gave her a chance to play in postseason play,” Mitchell said. “To be able to look herself in the mirror and look back and be proud because no matter what, you’re human and it’s typically that last game that you’re going to remember, I didn’t want her to have any regrets.”</p>\n<p>The team’s second straight postseason appearance, Underwood went into that game just one point shy of the 1,000-point mark. She became the 24th player in program history to join the 1,000-point club.</p>\n<p>“To be able to reflect on the season and know that I have not one regret, I think I can look at myself and be proud of that,” Underwood said.</p>\n<p>In the face of adversity, both on the court and off, Underwood has certainly proved to be nothing less than a fighter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/","id":632,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[631,630,629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
