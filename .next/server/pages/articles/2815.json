Senate, by a secret vote of six-to-one, a resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Israel-Palestine region.</p>\n<p>The one dissenting vote, made public shortly after the vote was taken, came from off-campus Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh. The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), urges the UC Board of Regents to withdraw its investments from companies selling arms and weapons to the Israeli government for or by the Israeli military on the grounds that such companies profit off of the military occupation of Palestinian-controlled territories, and that such investments are contrary to the obligation of the UC to promote equality and human rights for all.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row a divestment resolution related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been brought before the Senate, with prior iterations of the bill defeated in the past two years. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution at their weekly meeting next Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the idea of tabling the resolution came in light of Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, which takes place next Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>“While this resolution has been moved to committee and is expected to go out to the student senate, there are those who bring forward the idea that there is a Jewish holiday next week that would require it to be pushed another week,” Goodman said. “There is no one who is not Jewish who can tell me or the Jewish community that our holiday … is a reason not to bring this forward.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said he urged action on the resolution in order to allow the Senate to move forward on to other issues and also opposed further postponing a vote on the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Actually, it’s really patronizing for someone to have proposed that there are Jewish reasons, … that they, out their sensitivity for me and my community, would not want to bring it up,” Goodman said. “So I urge you to pass this out of committee so the Senate can deal with it and the campus can go on to dealing with this and other issues.”</p>\n<p>SJP member Nia, who requested to not have her full name disclosed, said she supported tabling the resolution for an additional week in light of Yom HaShoah.</p>\n<p>“It’s SJP’s mission to work against all forms of oppression, so we feel it’s really important to recognize that and honor that day for all Jewish students, and just let them know that we stand in solidarity … and recognize that and push it back another week so that it’s not at a time when a lot of people are sensitive,” Nia said.</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she found it “patronizing” and “offensive” to push the resolution vote back another week.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the week after week four, April 23rd, is Yom Hazikaron [Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism], so if you are doing your Jewish holiday searching you didn’t do an amazing job because … you’d have to wait ’til week five if that’s your logic,” Elyasi said. “Also to say that you are standing in solidarity with Jewish students when Jewish students feel attacked by a resolution that you’re bringing up to me is just a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said she was concerned about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement’s insistence upon the “Right of Return” for the 700,000 Palestinian refugees that are said to have been forcibly removed or evacuated from the territory that now constitutes the political boundaries of Israel.</p>\n<p>“If the Palestinians who no longer live in Israel were to return to Israel that would mean Israelis would be a minority, so Israel would cease to exist in its current state,” Moreh said. “To my understanding, that would mean the end of Israel.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur defended the passage of the resolution and said allowing Palestinian refugees return would not threaten Israeli sovereignty.</p>\n<p>“We at SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) absolutely stand by the Right of Return,” Kaur said. “We believe the people that were kicked out of their homeland have the right to return. However, I do challenge the notion that that would destroy the state of Israel altogether.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said she believes in the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that one people’s self-determination has to mean the end of another’s,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he advocated for the ability of students from both the Jewish and Palestinian community to make an effort to listen to empathize with one another.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been able to have real dialogue between both the Jewish community and the Palestinian community,” Abdalmalik said. “I highly encourage all of you, no matter how much you personally believe in your cause, to reach out across the aisle and to have open conversation that starts with unification between the two sides.”</p>\n<p>According to Abdalmalik, after engaging in discussion about divestment with students from both sides of the issue, he was able to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“I asked a lot of the folks in the Jewish community if you believe that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination — and every one of you said yes,” Abdalmalik said. “And I asked the folks on the other side of the aisle if they believe the Jewish people have the right to self-determination — and they said yes. That, in it of itself, is such a good start to seeing how we can form a resolution that promotes both people’s rights to self-determination.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

engineering, computer science, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE), and sociology departments, will be held this Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m. in Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association and themed “Unveiling the New: In Pursuit of the Next,”  this weekend’s event will feature lectures by chemical engineering Professor Frank Doyle , GGSE lecturer Jason Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff.  Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) is a non-profit organization hosting conferences across the globe. TEDx events are local iterations of TED conferences independently organized by community members.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, he will be speaking on the development of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery for people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I’ve watched many TED and TEDx lectures over the years and it is humbling and exciting to be asked to give one,” Doyle said in an email. “[I hope to] bring attention to some of the exciting frontiers of research that are happening here at UCSB – especially on medical problems despite the fact that we do not have a medical school.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she will be discussing the digital divide in the United States — referring to inequalities in access to information and communication technology in different parts of the world — as well as the importance of integrating computer science in elementary school curriculum.</p>\n<p>“The last generation needed to be competent users of computers to succeed professionally, but the innovators of the next generation will need to … understand how to harness the power of computers to create revolutionary products,” Franklin said in an email. “My work has the goal of understanding how to integrate computing into elementary school so that all students, regardless of background, have the opportunity to participate in this revolution.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he plans to speak on reassessing how the Millennial generation, referring to individuals born between the 1980s and mid-2000s, are taught in American schools with an emphasis on teacher effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“In order for us to be successful in the education system, we have to teach to the heart and not just to the mind,” Rios said. “That’s effective teaching — to teach with affection rather than focus on being effective as a teacher. Since this generation is more emotion-based, shouldn’t we teach through emotions?”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, his talk will focus the fundamental emotion of shame as well as the importance of not hiding emotions.</p>\n<p>“There’s no such thing as a negative emotion. They’re like breathing — they cause trouble only when they’re obstructed,” Scheff said. “It’s not a good idea to hide shame, or any emotion for that matter. You need to work through it.”</p>\n<p>Raley said his talk will discuss the importance of reshaping future discussions on education.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that kids are learning too little — it’s just that they’re learning too much of the wrong thing,” Raley said. “I would love for us to have much more thoughtful conversations about education. I think that the kind of conversations we have … [are] pretty conventional most of the time — the same problems, the same ideas.”</p>\n<p>Third-year zoology major and UCSB TEDx event organizer Edward Trout said he hopes the event will expose students to important ideas otherwise less accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the idea is finding what’s new, or what maybe even is old and dispersing it to a wider audience,” Trout said. “Scientists, academics — we study things and we make these papers and circulate them among ourselves and they never get out to the public. What’s the point? If all these ideas never leave the ivory tower, nothing’s going to change.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Shehata holds a first-hand account of what it was like to be on the ground during the Egyptian protests during 2011, according to Kaplan.</p>\n<p>“He is a rather remarkable informant on those events and consequences,” Kaplan said. “It is a wonderful opportunity to hear a perspective from below from someone who was a participant.”</p>\n<p>According to a brief biography written by Shehata for the lecture, he is currently working on human rights issues in Egypt, including “peaceful demonstrations, freedom of opinion, expression and information, and housing rights.”</p>\n<p>Kaplan said aspects of Shehata’s lecture that will be particularly appealing to student audiences involve his extensive involvement in youth mobilization during the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He was essential in organizing youth participation during the events of the Egyptian Revolution and still is,” Kaplan said. “So this idea of social mobilization is very interesting for those who are interested in social movements in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaplan, Shehata participated in key negotiations between activists and members of the military and can offer additional unique perspectives to conventional academic studies on the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He took part in roundtables with elites and military members, so his perspective is rather refreshing in that he provides insights that a more academic, distanced study cannot,” Kaplan said.</p>\n<p>First-year communications major Ruben Rodriguez said he is interested in the fall of governments and ruling elites, and looks forward to attending the talk.</p>\n<p>“A lot of governments recently have been overthrown through civil protest, so it’ll be interesting to see [Shehata’s] account of protests in Cairo during 2011,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics and accounting major Nicholas Lynch, his Middle Eastern Studies class this past Fall Quarter peaked his interest in the Egyptian Revolution.</p>\n<p>“The Middle East is still in flux and it would be interesting to not only hear his accounts of the revolution in 2011, but also hear what he has to say about the future state of many other countries in turmoil,” Lynch said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/political-activist-to-lecture-on-experience-in-egyptian-revolution/","id":2813,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2812,2811,2810],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Committee to Erect I.V.

The committee discussed specific details of the various event and art installation ideas, and members said they hope to see their plans come to fruition in the weeks surrounding the May 23 tragedy’s anniversary.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy opened the meeting by restating the special committee’s objective to plan an event that reflects the student body and I.V. community’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I really want this to be something community-generated, something that feels organic and that the community would want to see happen,” Guthy said. “It shouldn’t be something that’s official or that we need to do just because we should. It’s whatever’s right for us.”</p>\n<p>Guthy told the committee that A.S. would help with a candlelight vigil on May 23 which she said will be similar to the vigil A.S. hosted in the days following last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students is interested in helping to facilitate a memorial walk/candlelight vigil like we did last year,” Guthy said. “That is one of the events that I personally would like to attend and see as a member of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the Surf Club will likely help with a memorial paddle-out similar to last year’s, which would take place sometime during the week after the anniversary.</p>\n<p>“We’ve spoken with Surf Club, who hosted that last year, and they’ve expressed interest in hosting another one,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board Commissioner and fourth-year global studies major Benjamin Simons said the board would be able to provide logistical support for the May 23 vigil.</p>\n<p>“We would like to help really put on the vigil,” Simon said. “We will be providing our sound system like we did last time and security like we did last time.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould encouraged A.S. to end the walk at Perfect Park, because IVRPD will be dedicating a memorial garden there on May 16.</p>\n<p>“We could have a stage or speakers at the end to incorporate the memorial garden,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Spatial Studies Professor in the art department Professor Kim Yasuda said there will likely be an art installation in Perfect Park if A.S. and the art department can gather funds to commission Bamboo DNA Founder Gerard Minakawa, who has designed structures for music festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, to create something for the anniversary memorial.</p>\n<p>“[He] is very interested in contributing his artistic ability … to do something appropriate that would be an illuminated structure,” Yasuda said. “Our goal is that it would be the start of a structure or even a sculpture in that park and that it becomes kind of a centerpiece.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said members of the art department are collaborating on a concept of a blue LED-lit pathway from campus to I.V. that would line the silent walk portion of the May 23 vigil and create a “collective force.”</p>\n<p>“I think a concept that would be really powerful would be if we started to light things in May and then people, businesses, community members started contributing to this blue light,” Yasuda said. “Then, by the 23rd, it’s kind of an experiment in how people build solidarity.”</p>\n<p>The art department is exploring ways to allow individual students to place the LED lights, so students who cannot or choose not to participate in the vigil can express support for the remembrance events, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to get all stakeholders contributing something together,” said Yasuda. “If we started in May, it could accumulate by social media.”</p>\n<p>Education and Outreach Coordinator at UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program and alumnus Marjan Riazi said the C.A.P.S. clinical staff will make themselves available at the vigil to support students in need of their services.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the clinical staff would be happy to be there as emergency first responders for people who are triggered,” Riazi said.</p>\n<p>Guthy said the committee is still making decisions on how they will use university emails and social media to publicize the events once plans are finalized.<br>\n“We want to get the information out — at least about the dates — sooner rather than later,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
