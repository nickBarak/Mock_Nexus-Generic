The minor was additionally charged with making criminal threats, and Rapin with kidnapping for the purpose of robbery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were also identified as the armed robbers who held the victims at gunpoint, according to Raquel Zick, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office public information officer,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who sent out a press release about the arrests on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rapin does not attend UC Santa Barbara, according to the student directory. He is being held with no bail at the Santa Barbara County Jail, while the minor was booked at the Santa Maria Juvenile Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBSO, with the assistance of the San Francisco Police Department, served three search warrants in San Francisco on Friday at the each of the suspects’ homes, as well as at the house of the owner of the vehicle that was used to flee the scene. Several items related to the robbery were recovered, according to Zick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vehicle’s owner was not arrested, Zick said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two are the third and fourth suspects to be arrested for the robbery; police </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-23/police-arrest-two-suspects-in-i-v-in-connection-with-armed-robbery/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested two Isla Vista residents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 20-year-old Heyaw Meteke and 21-year-old Jawad Hebbar, on the 67 block of Del Playa Drive a week after the robbery took place.

Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) served a search warrant on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by SBSO Saturday morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the search, detectives recovered numerous items that were taken during the robbery and they arrested two suspects,” Raquel Zick, SBSO spokesperson, said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meteke was charged with robbery and false imprisonment and booked on a $100,000 bail, while Hebbar faces accessory charges with a $20,000 bail. Hebbar is a UCSB student, according to the student directory; Meteke’s custody logs state he is a student, but the name of the college he attends is not listed.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2 p.m. on Saturday, Meteke is still in custody, according to custody logs. Hebbar is no longer in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investigation is ongoing, Zick said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p>No further suspects have been arrested as of Monday, Zick told the Nexus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown whether the police have located the third suspect involved in the incident. SBSO did not immediately return requests for comment involving the arrests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial reports came in around 10:23 a.m. on Nov. 18 that three individuals had fled a house on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista after reportedly robbing two victims at gunpoint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two victims had been inside the apartment at the time; one sustained minor injuries. The suspects took two laptops, one phone, one wallet and cannabis, police said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zick said at the time that police believed the victims were “specifically targeted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the suspects — a white man wearing a ski mask and all black and a white man wearing no ski mask and camouflage — were armed with handguns, while the third, a black man who was wearing all black, was reportedly not carrying a gun. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated [Nov. 25, 12:44 p.m.]</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Comer, director of SBC Public Health Microbiology Laboratory,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, SBC public health officer in the Public Health Department, to elaborate on how the county is responding to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would like to have everyone tested, but unfortunately, at the moment, we just cannot afford it. I’m looking forward to the next week or 10 days when we have a much better capability [for testing],” Ansorg said. “I urge people to understand that this is not in our hands. Nationwide, there are low shortages of important ingredients in these test kits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg explained that the county has created a priority tier system for those who need to be currently tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tier 1 are the “most vulnerable,” such as elderly individuals in senior residential facilities and nursing homes, as well as health care workers such as doctors and nurses, whose services are “critical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier 2 is composed of severely ill people, cases “where it would make a big difference if they are diagnosed early.” In Tier 3, the lowest category, are people who are “very mildly ill.” Those classified in Tier 3 should isolate themselves until they are fever free for three days, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel members noted they’ve seen a number of questions from community members about how the virus is spread; Batson explained that the coronavirus is transmitted “via droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The coronavirus is] unlike other airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis that don’t weigh as much … Whenever someone coughs, the droplet can typically only go three feet,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is one of the reasons we are encouraging social distancing because if you stay away from someone who is coughing and the droplet can only go three feet, then it is unlikely you would inhale the infectious droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the virus can also be transmitted by touching surfaces, which is why it is important for individuals to continually disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg said that while currently the county has “more than enough” collection kits to be able to test symptomatic patients, more test kits will be available as “more labs are coming online.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comer clarified that between the Cottage Hospital system and private offices, there are over 1,700 coronavirus testing kits. Van Do-Reynoso said that “to the best of our knowledge, [getting tested] is very affordable because it is free. There is no cost-sharing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you’re coming down with a sore throat, nasal congestion, a cough, a fever, please consider yourself a potential case. I don’t mean this in order to make people afraid, but take this seriously,” Ansong said. “Do not go to work. Do not mingle with people. Stay isolated and take care of yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 17, 2:56 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
