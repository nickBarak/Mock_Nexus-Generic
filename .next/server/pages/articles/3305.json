\r\n</script> \n<p>After coming close to giving up on competition altogether before the season of her junior year in 2014, Tsolis revitalized her track career in the blink of an eye, and has now come back just two years later to rewrite the Gauchos’ record books in her favorite event, the 1500m. And she’s not done yet.</p>\n<p>Tori came into the UCSB track program five years ago as the fastest recruit of her year with some very impressive credentials out of Presentation High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>She was MVP of her high school squad all four years, and she ran the most competitive time of her Gaucho class at the California state finals her senior year, placing 13th in the 800m with a time of 2:12.82.</p>\n<p>When asked why she chose Santa Barbara, she immediately said “beach.” However, while the location of the school is undoubtedly a huge pull for recruits, for her, this was just one reason among countless others of why she chose to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“It was just a switch, like ‘I belong here.’ Everyone seemed really hardworking, and [it seemed like] an everyone’s-there-for-each-other kind of thing,” Tsolis said. “The day after my recruiting trip, I got home and I called [Head Coach] Pete [Dolan] and was like, ‘I want in.’”</p>\n<p>The star runner earned a scholarship eventually with her performance at state finals, but she still accepted less for the opportunity to study and compete at her dream school.</p>\n<p>“I could have gone to a different school and gotten a lot more money, but I just liked it here so much, and it’s paid off,” said Tsolis. “And I feel like I’m a pretty good recruiting investment, if you ask me.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Head Coach Pete Dolan would agree on that point now, after all the success the two have enjoyed together. But this was not always so clear-cut.</p>\n<p>Before Tori even started her first year of school at UCSB, she got off to a rocky start. She came in and got injured in just the first couple weeks of cross country training over the summer before freshman year, forcing her out of cross competition that season.</p>\n<p>Then track season came around, and it didn’t go very well. She didn’t PR in the 800, and although she did have a PR in the 1500, she now knows that even that time was nowhere near her potential.</p>\n<p>As if her underperformance wasn’t discouraging enough, right before the conference finals, Tori suffered a back injury that prevented her from participating in the conference event and set her back for her sophomore year cross season as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the injuries continued as she endured a stress fracture, forcing her out of competition for the entirety of the season.</p>\n<p>“This was just a very low point in my running career here … I just didn’t even have to go to practice, and I was making all these new friends, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it anymore,” Tsolis explained.</p>\n<p>As Tori started to get healthy again that summer, Dolan was getting frustrated with how things seemed to be turning out.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking she’s just kind of becoming a rec runner. She can run [at this point], but she wasn’t really training, just running,” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>Eventually what got Tori back on track, both literally and figuratively, was some much-needed prodding from a friend and teammate who just graduated last year.</p>\n<p>“Her teammate, Dani Moreno gets the credit,” said Dolan. “Dani Moreno still believed in her and said, ‘If you still want to do this, you’ve got to get after it.’”</p>\n<p>Then, right before her junior year track season, Dolan told her with two weeks notice that she needed to do a two-mile time trial to stay on the team. To make things even more difficult, he gave her no target time to hit.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘You’ve just got to impress me, Tori. C’mon, you’ve got good credentials in high school. Just impress me.’”</p>\n<p>Tori trained as best she could, and with the help of Moreno pacing her at the start, she was able to run 11:06 to impress Dolan and keep her spot on the team.</p>\n<p>“That was the point when I was like, ‘OK, I can’t give up,’” said Tsolis. “That was when I was like, ‘If I do this well, I’m going to stay on the team and keep running, and if I don’t then I’m going to be done with my running career at UCSB.’”</p>\n<p>Since the time trial, Tori has been able to stay relatively healthy for the rest of her career while consistently pushing herself in her training.</p>\n<p>She began chipping away at her times as soon as she returned to the track her junior season, working hard to get back into it.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting her to run that fast ’cause it was her first real season back, [but] it got better and better and, most of the time, I was just shaking my head and going, ‘I can’t believe she’s running this fast,’” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>It all goes back to what Dolan said prior to the time trial: “Impress me.” Now, she impresses him all the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70854\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809397136\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70875\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70854\" data-attachment-id=\"70854\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/courtesy-of-tori-tsolis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=1040%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70854\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=294%2C453\" alt=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" width=\"294\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1182&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Tori Tsolis</em></p></div>\n<p>Tsolis made it to the first round of regionals that junior year. Then in her senior year in 2015, she was able to advance to the second race of the first round, moving up to No. 2 on the UCSB all-time list in the 1500m in the process.</p>\n<p>This season, she finally broke the 11-year-old school record in the 1500m with a 4:19.02 at the Mt. Sac College Invite a few weekends ago.</p>\n<p>“I was ninth in my race, so I just stood there watching [the clock] go by each one. I’m like, ‘Come on, what did I run?’” Tsolis said. “And then I saw it, and I just tried to find my coach in the stands and I was like, ‘I did it!’”</p>\n<p>As the team works through postseason play now, Tori is looking to make it to nationals and become an All-American this year. She also hopes she can help her team to a top-three finish in the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“That’s where I’m looking right now,” said Tsolis. “It sounded ambitious going into the year, but now it’s more tangible, I think.”</p>\n<p>Dolan knows Tori is already in the upper echelon of athletes he has had the chance to coach, but if she reaches these goals, he knows she will forever cement her legacy at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“That last race at Mt. Sac (where she beat the UCSB record in the 1500), it was off the charts,” Dolan said. “My heart’s pumping, I’m going, ‘Wow, she’s doing it. She is right there with the best in the country.’ So I’m just staying with that.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Tsolis’ commitment has influenced one of the other two Toris on UCSB’s women’s team, junior decathlete Tori Usgaard, who says she has always looked up to the elder Tori for her mindset and work ethic.</p>\n<p>“Every time you see her work out, she’s always pushing herself to be front of the pack. I think that’s the biggest thing, that she proves to everyone else that hard work pays off,” Usgaard said. “[She’s proof] that it takes time, but you have to trust the process and it’ll all come through eventually.”</p>\n<p>Tsolis is happy to focus this much time and energy on her training because of how rewarding it is for her to see the results.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you get out of it what you put into it, and I spend so many hours practicing. I’m on the bike, I’m on the elliptical, I’m in the pool,” Tsolis said. “[All] because I can’t run as much as I want to because I get injured easily. So I’m just doing weights and everything to stay healthy and injury-free, and it’s so rewarding now that everything has come together.”</p>\n<p>Tori also points to the endless support and understanding of her lifestyle from her family and friends as a huge influence that pushes her and keeps her going.

This was quickly followed by a second sighting near Devereux Lagoon on West Campus the next day; the following morning, Sept. 19, a sighting near West Campus was reported again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were then no sightings for almost three weeks until Oct. 7, when UCSB students Dulce Simental and Monica Lopez spotted a large and “very built” animal fleeing on all fours while the two were watching the sunset below the Campus Point bluffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molly Hardesty-Moore, a researcher associated with the McCauley Lab at UCSB who focuses on urban and carnivore ecology, sat down with the Nexus to discuss the likely origins of the mountain lion, as well as the implications of repeat sightings so close to civilization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardesty-Moore pointed to two possible scenarios: the mountain lion may have come to campus by following the coast, approaching from the relatively undeveloped north, or it may have come to campus from the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains by crossing the 101 Freeway and crossing a number of human settlements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I got out Google Maps as soon as I heard about this. I was like, ‘How the heck would this guy get here?’ We’re surrounded by the 101 and the 217. Even going along the coast there’s sporadic houses and ranches,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it went from Campus Point to Devereux, it wouldn’t go through Isla Vista without being sighted, so it seems like it went along the beach during low tide, if that’s possible. It’s also possible it came in along the coast originally.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the mountain lion was confined to small strips of coast and navigated these spaces using the beaches to avoid humans, it would be difficult for it to sustain itself, as its primary food source is deer, which can’t be found in the immediate coastal area, she noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Lions] do eat raccoons as a secondary food source, and we do have a decent amount of racoons,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She added, however, that she is unsure how easy it would be for a mountain lion to switch to a prey source it is not used to; as part of her research, she monitors the movement of racoons throughout campus and the greater urban environment with GPS collars and has not come across evidence to suggest that a mountain lion is hunting the racoons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also unlikely that a mountain lion would willfully return to campus after hunting elsewhere unless it had to, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it has a good route to go up the coast through the beach, maybe it is going up and then feeling pressure to come back for whatever reason, but I would more expect that it’s stuck here. If it could leave in a good way, it would, and it wouldn’t come back,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One possibility is that conflict from another mountain lion is compelling this one to linger near the coast. Mountain lions are territorial predators who need a lot of land, so juvenile males may find themselves inadvertently encroaching on urban spaces to avoid conflict with other more established adults, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems probable that the one sighted could be a young male, since they tend to be the ones that disperse. I don’t know why it would be returning [to campus areas] unless it were being driven away by an aggressive older male, since they’re really territorial,” Hardesty-Moore said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mountain lions are wide-ranging species, and when they get old enough, they disperse. It’s sort of a normal thing for them to start seeking new spaces, although it’s not as normal to get into human spaces.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human stressor may also be a culprit. Mountain lions throughout California are victims of intense habitat fragmentation and can become cut off from one another. This is especially true in coastal Southern California, where the urban landscape is sprawling and extensive, save for pockets of land along the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, according to Hardesty-Moore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mountain lions are] really bad at crossing roads and being around people because we just tend to get rid of them. Southern California is just full of people,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, UCSB’s campus and Devereux Lagoon are a far cry from untouched, and the presence of comparatively high-quality open space in the hills across the 101 Freeway make it difficult to entertain the notion that a mountain lion would flee to the coast in search of better habitat, Hardesty-Moore explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hardesty-Moore, mountain lions are only known to attack humans in extreme circumstances, but students should still exercise caution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a big predator. That is something to be mindful of. If it’s scared or hungry or lost, that could make the situation worse, but it’s almost always really extreme circumstances </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— [if] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the mountain lion is starving, for example. Usually they don’t want anything to do with people,” Hardesty-Moore said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’ve ever been out hiking in the hills, odds are that a mountain has seen you do that. But it doesn’t want you, it doesn’t need you. It doesn’t want human prey. You’re just trouble for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardesty-Moore and Peter Alagona, an associate professor in history and environmental studies, plan to meet with the UC Police Department, state and federal government officials and fellow scholars in early November to discuss “mountain lions, public safety, and wildlife coexistence on the UCSB campus,” Alagona said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hardesty-Moore, the recent sightings give the community a chance to better understand the natural world which surrounds campus and how it can intersect with civilization — sometimes in messy ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a good opportunity to think ‘Oh my gosh, these creatures are actually really close to us.’ They live right around us and sometimes they come around here, and we need to think about how to coexist with them and figure out problems like this when they happen.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

This unique mold of “strength” fits the character of 6-year-old Leah Still.</p>\n<p>A full-time daughter, “Uptown Funk” dancer and cancer survivor, Leah has permeated the hearts of many during her road to recovery. Daughter of current Houston Texan and former Cincinnati Bengal defensive tackle Devon Still, the two have come a long way since their experience of misfortune in June 2014.</p>\n<p>The then 4-year-old Leah was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma, an aggressive disease which attacked the preschooler’s vital glands and yielded a 50/50 chance of survival. The odds were unfavorably stacked against the NFL player and his daughter.</p>\n<p>While tears and agony barely consoled the hearts of her friends and family members, oddly enough the 4-year-old girl took on her challenge with a collected mind and grin on her face.</p>\n<p>After undergoing four months of radiation, surgery and remission treatment, results indicated a steady decline of Leah’s harmful tumors. There was no doubt about it: The upbeat child was beating cancer.</p>\n<p>Much like his daughter, who faced this dreadful disease head on, Still did not let this alarming setback hinder him from assisting his daughter. He wrote the slogan “Leah Strong” on his nasal strip every time he stepped on the field, and this motto quickly circulated through the nation, making everyone aware that Leah’s fight was bigger than she was.</p>\n<p>Fans on and off the gridiron showcased their united support for the 26-year-old Still, including the Bengals organization, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and New Orleans Saints Head Coach Sean Payton, who bought 1,000 Devon Still jerseys in response to the lineman’s cause. In total, over $1 million were raised for his daughter and other families locked in a similar battle with pediatric cancer.</p>\n<p>The brave Leah also received recognition from celebrities at the 2015 Espy Awards. Earning herself the Jimmy V Award, the highest honor for courage and perseverance, Leah officially joined the ranks of sports heroes such as the late Stuart Scott, former Rutgers star Eric LeGrand and Hall of Famer George Karl who have had their medical battles recognized on a grand scale.</p>\n<p>A successful triumph over life’s biggest obstacle led young Leah to become the flower girl in her father’s wedding last Sunday. Full of life and energy and ready for the big stage, it was Leah who stole the show on her father’s big day with her moves on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>This moment was a celebration of a new chapter in the Still family, but more importantly it signified a celebration of life itself. Leah’s battle with cancer was finally over. She surmounted her biggest obstacle, and that is definitely a moment that everyone could enjoy.</p>\n<p>Leah’s story is the story of a little kid with a big heart which warms the minds of many, a girl whose narrative proved to be just as inspiring as those of the athletes we adore today.</p>\n<p>On that day of matrimony for Devon Still, his daughter was not just his flower girl. She was a fighter, who persevered and is a living testament to the fact that when life’s struggles try to bring you down, you can still remain strong within.</p>\n<p>It is this idea of “strength” that will carry on in Leah Still forever.</p>\n<p>#LeahStrong</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
