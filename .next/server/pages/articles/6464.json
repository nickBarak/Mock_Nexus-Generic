While Governor Abbott claims that abortions are not a critical medical procedure, the fact that women are traveling out of state to get abortions when it is safer to stay at home indicates how essential these services truly are. Unfortunately, not everyone has the means to travel and are instead being stripped of their agency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court in Texas blocked the ban, but this decision was appealed and </span><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/texas-can-ban-medication-abortions-during-virus-efforts-appeals-court-rules\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overturned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing medication abortions to be banned during the crisis. </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten days ago</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, state officials in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas have all made similar cases to implement an abortion ban, but the federal judges have ruled to allow abortion procedures to continue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, this is not a fight state officials are willing to let go of easily and there will likely be more attempts to appeal abortion rulings like in Texas. It is no coincidence that many of the states making headlines for attempting to implement these bans are states who are notorious for their already strict restrictions on abortion access. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are being turned away at abortion clinics, only adding to their stress amid the pandemic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these states have previously passed </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/05/729753903/early-abortion-bans-which-states-have-passed-them\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“heartbeat” bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which prevent a woman from getting an abortion at the first detection of a fetal heartbeat </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. If these states were to enforce an abortion ban with no definite end, women might not be able to even get abortions after the ban is lifted because they would be considered an illegal procedure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are being turned away at abortion clinics, only adding to their stress amid the pandemic. It is unacceptable that certain politicians feel that they can abuse their power and take away a woman’s right to choose, especially during a time when there are countless other stressors dominating people’s everyday lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spread of coronavirus has caused unemployment rates to skyrocket, made the simple act of grocery shopping a daunting task and left countless families without basic resources. If a woman decides that she is not capable of bringing her pregnancy to completion, she needs to have the ability to make that decision at all times. This is especially true during a pandemic when the risks to her health and well-being are intensified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those in favor of reproductive rights have demonstrated how unacceptable it is that politicians would infringe upon women’s rights in an already tumultuous time. </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genevieve Scott,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, has argued against the abortion ban in Tennessee. She stated that if an abortion is delayed, there can be a greater risk of complications, underscoring the time-sensitive nature of the procedure which several politicians appear to be utterly disregarding. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Republican politicians involved with this debate should not be using a pandemic to push forth their own political agendas.

The AMA directly referred to how elected officials are “exploiting this moment” and bringing politics into a decision that should be purely medical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the amount of medical supplies that proponents of the abortion bans claim would be conserved is</span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not significant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The foundation of the argument to implement these abortion bans has absolutely no backing. Regardless, certain states are continuing to force these bans into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it is up to the healthcare professionals to decide if a medical procedure is essential. Political beliefs should play no role in that decision. The Republican politicians involved with this debate should not be using a pandemic to push forth their own political agendas. They are igniting a divisive issue at a time when the country especially needs to be unified.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop strongly believes that doctors should decide which medical procedures are necessary, not politicians. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

Sanders defends the notion that the current economic structure is “rigged” and must be abolished completely in order to establish a government that reinvents justice. Senator Warren embraces policies of change to the current system, and offers a remedy in her economic patriotism agenda. She pledges a commitment to fundamentally change the government’s approach to the economy, by placing American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of large corporations and Wall Street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As exhibited by their policies, Sanders and Warren represent two vastly different approaches to changing the injustices present in the American system of government. The leftist stance that Sanders presents is founded on the notion that the United States must abolish the system that enables economic disparities, while Warren seeks to reform the system from the inside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One issue that is at the forefront of this election is the student debt crisis affecting 44.7 million Americans, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/student-loan-statistics-2019-n997836\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $1.5 trillion dollars of student debt in the United States is an issue that the Democratic party pledges to eradicate. However, Senators Sanders and Warren offer varying remedies that demonstrate the divisions between their idealistic and realistic approaches, respectively.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Sanders </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/24/bernie-sanders-student-loan-debt-proposal/1544864001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to relieve all student debt by raising money through a Wall Street tax that would add fees to the sale and trade of bonds and stocks. This ambitious effort benefits people of all classes, but asks the government to raise vast amounts of money through means of taxation. This unrealistic plan fails to earn enough revenue to support this initiative, and stands to affect middle class workers. While the tax is aimed at Wall Street investor offices, the debt would fall upon investors themselves when making a transaction. This would discourage trading and hinder the capitalist opportunities that this country is powered by. Senator Sanders proposes high aspirations that in theory would help shape the country. However, these methods of funding fail to meet the demands his programs call for. A sensible candidate such as Warren recognizes the practical approach that must be taken in order to enact real change in the government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Warren, on the other hand, </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/elizabeth-warrens-student-debt-bill-would-help-45-million-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presents an initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to focus on students who come from lower income households. Her plan proposes to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for every individual with an income under $100,000. For those with an annual income between $100,000 and $250,000, she promises substantial debt reduction. Warren plans to fund her program with a “wealth tax,” which levies a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, and a 3% tax on individuals who have more than $50 million. Her objective allows for a more affordable plan than the one Senator Sanders advocates for. The Vermont senator’s bill would </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost the government $2.2 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the course of 10 years, while Warren’s would only </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/06/27/how-do-warrens-and-sanders-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-compare/#4a1150de18c4%5D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost $1.25 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the same timespan. This approach to the higher education crisis in the United States demonstrates the dream-like idealism characterizing Senator Sanders’ policies. Warren understands the urgency of these national issues, but her policies are comparatively pragmatic and cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren not only seeks a more practical approach to politics, but she has demonstrated with her extensive track record the effort it takes to successfully implement one’s policies in a bipartisan government. A good indicator of a politician’s potential for presidential success is their </span><a href=\"https://qz.com/1560188/what-the-2020-democratic-candidates-did-in-congress/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ability to pass bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while serving in the House or Senate. During the 2017-2019 congressional terms, when both the House and Senate were controlled by the Republican party for a year, Warren introduced five bills that passed in both houses. Senator Sanders was unable to pass any bills. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren embodies a candidate that can decisively enact her policy reforms and bring about change to the political system. She </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands by</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> abolishing capital punishment and private prisons; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour; free college education and Medicare For All. She is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/31/warrens-agenda-break-up-monopolies-give-workers-control-over-corporations-fight-big-pharma/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">committed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to investigating large corporations and their leaders, and taxing the wealthy to support welfare programs for all.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sanders preaches idealistic dreams of change, it remains unclear whether or not his policies can actually be enacted. Issues in governmental law cannot be solved by just one bill or proposal of change. In order to eradicate the major crises affecting the country today, the United States needs a leader with a clear head who possesses the ability to negotiate with the opposition. Radicalism only goes so far as its opponents will allow, and with a Republican majority still existing in the Senate, it is difficult for mass reform movements to mobilize. Slow and steady wins the race, and Senator Warren plans to enact reform through the strategy of cooperation in order to avoid facing large roadblocks that will result in political gridlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both politicians are leaders of progressive reform; however, Warren has not embraced Democratic socialism to the extent that Senator Sanders has. She promises to stand for compromise and uphold the values of a free market in the United States. It is time for a woman to fulfill the role of the President of the United States and carry her message to the White House.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Rubin strongly advocates the election of Elizabeth Warren to the White House. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BC6701CC-F449-4582-8D3F-5D62CB407529-Sara-Rubin.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sara-rubin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sara Rubin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sara Rubin is an Opinion staff writer and Political Science major.

The rock formations in Santa Barbara County require cyclic steam injection to extract oil, which unlike fracking, necessitates the injection of superheated steam rather than chemicals to extract oil. Therefore</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, banning fracking in this County would have little impact on oil production.

Bob Nelson, a candidate for the Fourth District seat on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors and former chief of staff for the current Fourth District Supervisor Peter Adam, </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has also received funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from oil interests. This district includes Orcutt, Lompoc, a southern segment of Santa Maria and part of the Los Alamos Valley. Currently running unopposed, Nelson has also been </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of Porter’s benefactors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In turn, Porter for 2020 has </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/FilerForms.aspx?y=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributed money and lawn signs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Nelson’s campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though he has received comparatively less contributions than Porter, Nelson has also received funding from multiple smaller, local oil figureheads. Most of </span><a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByCandidateName.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson’s donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come from real estate or housing development LLCs but many of these have ties to the oil industry. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Los-Angeles/burton-mesa-holdings-llc/67194667.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burton Mesa Holdings, LLC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has contributed $5000 to Nelson’s campaign, is led by Kenneth Hunter, who is also the president of </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0703841D:US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaquero Energy Inc.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a local oil and gas company. Kenai Drilling, another donor to Nelson’s 2020 campaign, is a local drilling company based locally in Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The company is owned by Tim Crist, who donated to Nelson’s campaign in his own name. Kenai is one of the</span><a href=\"http://www.kenaidrilling.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> largest drilling contractors in the state of California</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rigs available to conduct oil, gas and geothermal drilling on land as well as offshore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 3 we have a choice: to vote for a candidate whose policies are inextricable from the interests of the oil companies or vote for a Board of Supervisors that will stand up to Big Oil. Regardless of political orientation or party membership, a candidate’s funding says a lot about their values and so these facts matter. Afterall, climate change is a bipartisan issue and will affect us all. Here in </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are already experiencing the effects of the climate crisis.

With the public health crisis gaining status as a pandemic, and more and more cases of those infected with the virus emerging both in the U.S. and abroad, this is a catastrophe that no one has ever experienced in their lifetime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such bleak times, it is natural that a nation would look towards its leader for guidance. Unfortunately for the U.S., Donald Trump has mismanaged this crisis from the outset. Although it appears that he is finally starting to grasp the severity of it, his initial denial and spread of misinformation has only made things worse.

He has referred to the coronavirus as </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“fake news,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his trademark dismissal for all events that don’t align with his agenda. Trump has also </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Democrats’ criticism of his response to coronavirus is a“hoax” that was created to hurt Trump’s 2020 political campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s utter dismissal of the threat of coronavirus demonstrates his thorough lack of preparation and education on the subject. Even when he was later asked if he regretted his word choice, Trump said no. He claimed that he was proving he was capable of handling the Democratic “hoax” because his administration is doing </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“such a good job” </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of handling the virus. This is simply not true, as the Trump administration has consistently fumbled its attempts to contain the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late February 2020, the U.S. government had to decide if 14 individuals from the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who had tested positive for coronavirus should be flown home from Japan with a group of over 300 healthy individuals. The CDC strongly advised against this explaining that the infected individuals could easily spread the disease to healthy passengers. The US government decided to ignore this warning. Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-was-not-told-coronavirus-infected-americans-would-be-flown-home-from-cruise-ship/2020/02/21/ae58b24c-54be-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the fact that he was not aware of the government’s decision to do so, which is hard to believe. Even if that were true, that he would be so unaware of such an important decision is a blaring display of his incompetence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s portrayal of coronavirus as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-200323102618665.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“China Virus”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is racist. Trump is so worried about getting blamed for mismanaging the virus that he has resorted to pointing fingers elsewhere, carelessly fueling racial tensions in the process. We as a nation have unfortunately gotten used to Trump’s nonsensical rants, but this is especially unacceptable when time is of the essence and the country is in a state of full-fledged panic. We need a leader, not someone who is out to serve his own interests. Instead of guiding the U.S. through these trying times, Trump is putting Asian Americans at risk for hate crimes because he is so intent on deflecting blame. At the end of the day, this is an egotistical and self-serving approach because it does little to address the real problem and will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can truly see the extent of Trump’s failings by looking at how other leaders are handling the situation. For example, South Korea has also experienced a significant number of outbreaks, but their </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/17/south-koreas-coronavirus-success-story-underscores-how-us-initially-failed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was prompt and aggressive, unlike that of the US. The South Korean government made testing readily available in order to determine the number of cases and isolate those who were infected for treatment. The South Korean government was also more transparent with the information they presented to the public, with the effect of decreasing feelings of panic. As a result of these measures, South Korea has managed to </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow the rate of infection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Testing in the U.S., on the other hand, has been more of a reactionary measure than the preventative one it should be and is </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still not widely available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by any means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, Trump’s ineffectiveness in dealing with the coronavirus is having — and will continue to have — dire consequences. The worst-case scenario for the US is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-projections-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.2 million deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an overwhelming amount of people lacking medical care due to a shortage of  hospital beds and doctors being forced to make heartbreaking decisions in terms of who to provide treatment to. The need for all these restrictions, including school closures and lockdowns, is to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“flatten the curve”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible. Our healthcare system does not have infinite resources and we need to be careful not to overload it. It’s also necessary that we try to make supplies last longer, even if that results in a longer battle against the virus. We need only buy as many resources as necessary while making sure that our neighbors also have equal access to them. Now is not the time to let panic take control and for us to hoard essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is easy to get distracted by the problematic nature of Trump’s leadership, we as citizens must do our part to prevent the virus from spreading. These restrictions are a hassle. Being asked to abruptly move out of Isla Vista and transition into online classes are huge disappointments, especially for graduating seniors. Unfortunately, this is a developing situation and one we must adapt to by practicing effective social distancing and good hygiene. Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election. It will provide an opportunity for the American people to condemn Trump for the despicable way he is handling this crisis while using their vote to select a better leader for the future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop is dismayed by Trump’s ineffectual and racist handling of coronavirus and urges individuals to do their best to help contain it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.
