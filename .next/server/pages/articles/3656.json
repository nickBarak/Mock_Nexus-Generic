I was unhappy, and I didn’t have a place to call home on campus or in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how things change.</p>\n<p>I’ve been struck with flashbacks to specific moments at UCSB — like when my roommate, Raechel, and I ran around the lagoon for the first time freshman year, or when I canoed down the Colorado River with the Adventure Programs, or even when I walked through I.V. on one particular Saturday morning, soaking in the pure, hungover magic of it all.</p>\n<p>Over the years, these are the moments that have made me love UCSB, but I can’t tell you enough how much stepping into the <em>Nexus</em> office for the first time changed my life.</p>\n<p>It’s a dark, cold office with too much stale coffee but the perfect amount of old newspapers and dusty books. The people are warm and intelligent, without fail, every passing year and with each new class.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also does this thing that I love: It preserves memories and moments with every photo, every article and every Thursday print issue. And I hope the <em>Nexus</em> continues to be an emblem for our community, long after I’m gone and I am only left with the memories.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> and the people I have met during my time on staff have shaped the person I am today, but the <em>Nexus</em> continues to grow itself. I encourage you to be patient as Nexites learn more about themselves and the kind of journalists they want to be.</p>\n<p>I know we don’t always get it right. We won’t always get it right. It is our job as storytellers to listen to our community and fellow students to ensure that the history we’re preserving is accurate, its people accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>Jorge Mercado, the next editor in chief, is kind and capable, and will slip a sports reference into most any conversation, if given the opportunity. I hope you pop into his office to chat — his door is always open.</p>\n<p>Goodbyes are strange, but reporting on our community for the <em>Nexus</em> has assured me that I can always reflect on our shared moments documented in archives and stamped onto history. Maybe it’s not even goodbye, after all, its merely the passing of one era and on to the next.</p>\n<p>Thank you to every interviewee, to the dear <em>Nexus</em>, to my best friends and #roommate4life. And to you, UCSB, thanks for making me want to stick around.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/","id":3656,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3655,3654,3653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox","biography":"Not available","articles":[2252,2253,2310,2323,2350,2353,2354,2361,2362,2363,2365,2366,2367,2373,2379,2389,2398,2402,2414,2415,2423,2434,2442,2445,2462,2467,2471,2472,2479,2480,2487,2517,2522,2524,2545,2570,2576,2617,2636,2672,2714,2719,2721,2741,2832,3427,3587,3656,3746,3751,3770,3771,3802,3916,3917,3949,3955,3957,3966,4368,4370,4385,4443,4588,4611,4631,4808,7224],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Now, Carlton-Carew can add fashion designer and human rights advocate to her resume.</p>\n<p>The T-shirts were created by Carlton-Carew to promote the upcoming premiere of her documentary series, titled “America Show Me Your Hands,” which will be released on YouTube within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a mini docuseries that will analyze certain social issues going on within America and what Americans think we should do to fix those issues that are occuring within our environment or our community,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just about holding each other accountable for our future.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the meaning behind the phrase “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew said she associated it with a mother catching her child sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar and asking them to show her their hands.</p>\n<p>“It’s more engaging that way, it’s in a loving way; I want people to be transparent with each other because I want people to have conversations [about social issues],” she said.</p>\n<p>The series will be comprised of short 15-minute films. It will spotlight relevant social and political issues circulating the country including sexism, racism, healthcare, affordable education and housing, among other topics.</p>\n<p>The first episode will address xenophobia, the dislike or fear of people from foreign countries, a topic that is one of personal interest to Carlton-Carew, whose parents are both from Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the episode will highlight the effects of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on its recipients.</p>\n<p>“Temporary Protected Status allows certain people from certain countries to come to America if they’re seeking asylum, or their country experienced natural disasters or if it is unsafe for them to be there,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew, whose mother came to the United States under TPS in the 1990s as a result of the Sierra Leone Civil War, experienced firsthand the confusion that arises among the recipients when their status is terminated.</p>\n<p>Prior to President Trump’s administration, when a country that was originally granted TPS was deemed safe once again, the government would notify the recipients but then fail to enforce any action to send them back to their native country.</p>\n<p>They also would not provide them with the steps necessary to apply for citizenship in America, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Currently refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras who have sought refuge in America to escape natural disasters and violence within their countries have been notified that they need to leave between 2019 and 2020 or face deportation, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Through “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew aims to promote transparency and accountability between Americans in regards to these intense topics.</p>\n<p>“I want empathy; I want people to be able to understand each other’s situations. The only reason why I am where I am today is because Americans in my community didn’t look at my mother and I as strangers … they embraced us as Americans should do and they made sure that we felt welcome,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>The first episode will consist primarily of Carlton-Carew’s own story in regards to xenophobia, along with news clippings and photos of children from Honduras and Nepal that she received from a photographer who traveled there.</p>\n<p>The following episode, tackling affordable housing, will feature testimonials from college students who recognize the issue in their society and have begun taking steps to effect change in their community.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew wanted to create the film series during her first year at UCSB. However, it was only recently that she decided on a specific format and film topics and began to act on her ideas.</p>\n<p>“I started getting more involved in politics, and given our political climate I thought this was the most appropriate time. I couldn’t sit on this idea any longer –– I had to pursue it,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Her decision to become involved in A.S. was largely a result of her desire to see more film major representation within Senate.</p>\n<p>As first pro-tempore and off-campus senator, Carlton-Carew aspires to not only be a liaison between the student body and their senators but also to promote increased opportunities for student filmmakers.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew hopes to reach young adults with her T-shirts and documentaries in an effort to empower them.</p>\n<p>“I just want to empower young people to take charge of their future. By interviewing them, it puts them on a platform to engage with other people who might find [their stories] interesting.”</p>\n<p>As her following grows, Carlton-Carew, who designs the merchandise with her mom, aims to expand her products to include both hats and laptop stickers.</p>\n<p>“I want people to [see my shirt] and think about what it means,” Carlton-Carew said. “This is our future … America, show me your hands.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

recital and art exhibition on Thursday. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez </em></p></div>\n<p>For the first time at UC Santa Barbara, indigenous writers, poets and scholars gathered for “A Verbal Kaleidoscope,” a conference aiming to challenge how indigenous literature and practices are studied in Western academia by presenting modern-day indigenous literary movements.</p>\n<p>Throughout eight sessions across two days, the Spanish and Portuguese department brought together Juan Gregorio Regino, director of Mexico’s National Institute of Indigenous Languages, native Zapotec and Mazatec writers and local community members to discuss contemporary and ancestral indigenous peoples’ literary perspectives.</p>\n<p>The conference, which ran through April 4 and 5, started with a singing ceremony by local Chumash tribal members acknowledging and respecting the tribe’s history and life in their land in the nearby area.</p>\n<p>A majority of the discussions were held in Spanish and the poetry recital held at the Art, Design and Architecture Museum was translated from the native languages such as Irma Pineda Santiago’s poems in Zapotec.</p>\n<p>“We were very surprised by the caliber of the presentations,” Osiris Gómez, Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Literature and conference organizer said.</p>\n<p>Gómez previously said organizers wanted to break traditional conference dynamics by creating a more fluid conversation and feels they were able to accomplish that goal, but believes there is still room to grow when exploring indigenous literature in academia.</p>\n<p>“It was an amazing experience to be able to bring together writers and scholars in this level, especially people from all over the country and abroad,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>Gómez was impressed with the speakers’ keynote presentations and said they opened up the conversation for other speakers to participate and break out of the one-way conversation that presentations often create.</p>\n<p>He appreciated the speakers’ creativity in using their own literary work for their responses, such as when Juan Gregorio Regino started reading from his poetry to answer the questions from the moderator.</p>\n<p>“That’s when we really went into the poetic act to explore [the conversation],” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>At a later panel during the conference, Regino spoke about “revolutionizing modern literature,” claiming that what indigenous scholars are doing with their work is of the most contemporary literature in the world today.</p>\n<p>“La poesía lingüísticamente es una reconstrucción de la propia lengua,” Regino said, meaning “poetry linguistically reconstructs language.”</p>\n<p>He continued by saying that creating poetry with native languages indigenous people can get them involved in the world of creating literature.</p>\n<p>Another element of poetry that Regino finds useful for indigenous people is “la afirmación de decir ‘aquí estamos, aqui esta nuestras lenguas, aquí están nuestras escrituras y estamos vivos,’” Regino said, meaning “the affirmation in saying ‘we are here, here are our tongues, here is our literature and we are alive.”</p>\n<p>Regino said the indigenous literary movement is in a transition and that the conference itself has explored ways to see from the outside how the movement is progressing.</p>\n<p>The movement “tiene que transcender el mundo indígena, y solamente así es como cambiamos y vamos a sentir entendidos. Solamente así este movimiento va tener presencia y fuerza,” Regino said, meaning “[the movement] has to transcend outside of the indigenous world and only then will we feel understood and have presence and strength.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82342\" data-attachment-id=\"82342\"

giving the language a linguistically poetic aspect. <em>Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>Cherrie Moraga, award-winning author for This Bridge Called My Back and newly-hired English professor, spoke during the first session titled “Beyond Aztlan: New Nahua Perspectives.” Her talk, “Throwing Shade to the West,” presented a Xicana indigena point of view within literature and academia.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Moraga pointed out the long history of colonization of indigenous people and how traditional language departments were “generated from a very eurocentric perspective.”</p>\n<p>Moraga applauded the Spanish department for hosting a conference on subjects typically only covered in the field of anthropology.</p>\n<p>“To think that a Spanish department was actually hosting a conference on indigenous languages is an incredible breakthrough,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>“[The conference] speaks to this evolution of consciousness beginning to happen even among sites that traditionally held indigenous thinking and people in disregard,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>Moraga was particularly impressed with the Chumash women who spoke about recovering their own languages through working with non-indigenous anthropologists who have done research and have access to the languages.</p>\n<p>She said she admired them because “having to learn it through them, but then having to make it their own again,” is a challenge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Cabranes-Grant, chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department, asked “Qué tipo de conocimiento nos ofrece la poesía y qué instrumento epistemológico es la poesía?” meaning “What knowledge does poetry offer us and what epistemological instruments does it have?”</p>\n<p>Zapotec poet Irma Pineda Santiago responded by saying that poetry has a broad social function beyond communication and the various genres of the ancestral Zapotec language can particularly allow poetry to go beyond its traditional elements.</p>\n<p>“People were speaking from their creative process and to me, that was amazing, you can only get that type of conversation when you interview an author,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gómez said, if a second version of the conference is possible, they will grow from this one and come up with new conference dynamics. “I think this conference was a great step in bringing a different type of conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gómez noted that in bringing these poets to the conference, one can assume that they are representatives and can speak for their whole community or nation, but Gómez said they were very humble when presenting themselves.</p>\n<p>“They told us ‘this is what I do and this is how I represent my community,’ It was far more nourishing than just having a set of questions and their keynote address,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>“The intent of this conference is to create consciousness and not just about the political aspects of the literature, but I want it to become an invitation for people to actually become acquainted and curious,” Gómez said.</p><div
