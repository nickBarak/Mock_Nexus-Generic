Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers offered their reflections on the year and advice for their replacements. As of press time, new senators and executive members had not yet taken their positions.</p>\n<p>Many members of Student Lobby said they felt the process did not take into account the requests of the group, despite acknowledging the potential for collaboration and improvement. During public forum, Student Lobby co-chair Maria Flores said she believes issues could be resolved in manner that involve more student input.</p>\n<p>“We feel that there could be a more inclusive way to go about it,” Flores said. “We don’t negate the fact that student lobby could be changed for the better.”</p>\n<p>Current EVPSA Alex Choate read a letter from the 2011-2012 EVPSA Ahmed Mostafa in favor of the bill, which stated that the bill would help to create a “strong coalition between Student Lobby and EVPSA.”</p>\n<p>During A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s report, he defended the bill on the basis that many other UC campuses function with a stronger relationship between the EVP and the Student Lobby group, and that the EVPSA had always picked the chair until two years ago. According to Abboud, the change came as a result of personal vendettas within the association, rather than necessity.</p>\n<p>“The External Vice President used to pick the chair of Student Lobby, and then Ahmed won and they didn’t like him so they changed it,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Andre Theus, author of the bill, reported to senate that Student Lobby was unhappy with its unexpected and sudden timing and requested that the bill be pulled. However, he also said he recognized some ways the bill would benefit the organization.</p>\n<p>Second-year Student Lobby member Mohsin Mirza said he did not agree with the concept of allowing senators to significantly change a group that they were not directly involved in.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very dangerous precedent for students to restructure something who have not been involved in this,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Some Senators said they did not agree with the process of drawing up the bill, but did support the notion of creating a stronger coalition between the office of the EVPSA and Student Lobby.</p>\n<p>Senator Nick Onyshko said there should be more consideration for the solidarity of A.S. as a whole.<br>\n“It’s a little concerning to hear rhetoric such as autonomy…when we are one association,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>The bill passed with 12 votes in favor, 6 against, and 4 abstentions.</p>\n<p>As the process of swearing in new executives began, protesters from the Coalition for Survivors silently held up signs condemning administration and campus organizations for allegedly failing to address accusations of sexual assault made by second-year global studies major Crystal Long on April 23 against incoming External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers spoke about their experiences in office and offered words of advice.</p>\n<p>Abboud advised incoming officials and senators to treat each other with kindness, disregard party politics as much as possible, and keep overarching, long-term goals in mind.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be mean, don’t be petty towards each other. Don’t let party politics takeover A.S,” Abboud said. “Be mindful when you’re making decisions…we can’t lose sight of tuition increases becoming real.”</p>\n<p>Outgoing Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet devoted her time to thanking the senators, her co-executives and the A.S. staff members for supporting and accompanying her throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Outgoing EVPLA Alex Moore told incomers to remember that their actions will affect future generations of students.</p>\n<p>“Remind yourself that you’re laying down the tracks that the next generation will follow,” Moore said. “If you take yourself seriously … then you will be taken seriously.”</p>\n<p>Choate echoed Abboud’s plea that new elected officials remain respectful of each other, and advised them to stay true to their opinions.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said senators should make an effort to consider opposing opinions and listen to those that they disagreed with.</p>\n<p>“Take into consideration what the opposition has to say,” Whittaker said.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, senators passed a resolution opposing hydraulic fracturing, and decided to pull a bill that would have restructured the legal code for A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55474\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1751176755\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"55473\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55474\" data-attachment-id=\"55474\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/senators-amend-student-lobby-swear-in-execs/as-senate-photo_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?fit=1498%2C947&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1498,947\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400718226\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate photo_kenneth song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?fit=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?fit=888%2C561&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-55474\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song-1024x647.jpg?resize=610%2C385\" alt=\"Outgoing Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud swears in incoming president Ali Guthy.\" width=\"610\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?resize=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?resize=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AS-Senate-photo_kenneth-song.jpg?w=1498&amp;ssl=1 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outgoing Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud swears in incoming president Ali Guthy.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, May 22, 2014′s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It passed with nearly unanimous support, as only Senator Montana MacLachlan chose to abstain from the vote.</p>\n<p>Regarding the resolution, student sponsor of the legislation Guy Singer said the bill provided adequate leeway for the university to implement its demands without undue burden.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the UC Regents … and the treasury a lot of space with this,” Singer said. “Because it’s a big transition, we are giving them five years.”</p>\n<p>According to Singer, the goal is to get similar legislation passed at all UC campuses during the summer.</p>\n<p>Later, discussion on the bill to update A.S. election code began when Senator Ansel Lundberg read a letter aloud in support of the bill, which demands that a new single transferable vote (STV) system be implemented before the next A.S. election. The system would use preferential voting in which students would rank candidates according to favorability and would roll over votes of candidates that received less first-choice votes.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the current election system led to an unfair domination by a single party that does not accurately represent students.</p>\n<p>“The fact that a single party has come to dominate the representation of the entire student body represents a failure on the part of UCSB’s Associated Students,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the large numbers of voters that did not support the Open People’s Party were essentially disenfranchised by the current system. Lundberg said this exclusion is even more prominent after “two straight years of thousands of votes cast for DP candidates [led] to zero seats in the Senate.”</p>\n<p>MacLachlan said the STV system has a set of its own concerns, particularly in how it encourages for a competition in popularity between candidates and marginalizes political party influence.</p>\n<p>“I know that one issue that has been talked about is that if people ran more individually then it would turn into a popularity contest,” MacLachlan said. “What’s the counterargument to that?”</p>\n<p>In response, Lundberg said the new electoral system would not compromise the ability of parties to impact elections.</p>\n<p>“I would say that it still allows parties to thrive and in no way undermines parties … We’re not trying to ban parties,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Senator Derek Wakefield said the outgoing Senate is currently in an ideal position to pass legislation affecting the electoral system, as they are less likely to be hindered by political affiliations.</p>\n<p>“We are going to be leaving next week, so that puts us in a really good position to change toward a system such as this because essentially elections and winning is not as much in our minds,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Wakefield also said the bill to change the A.S. elections process represents a significant, influential and final piece of legislation for this year’s Senate.</p>\n<p>“As our last act of Senate, we can change how we are represented,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Following discussion on the bill to update the A.S. elections code, a bill to update student lobby legal code was tabled after various senators expressed opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano said he felt concerned that the bill violated the lobby’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fair for the board to be told what to do before they’ve even been elected,” Soriano said.</p>\n<p>Senator Lupe Zelada said the independence of the student lobby was being attacked. According to Zelada, the A.S. President backtracked on a previous agreement.</p>\n<p>“I do have a problem with somebody attacking our autonomy in our election process, especially when Jonathan Abboud gave us his word that he was not going change that or touch that,” Zelada said. “He completely just backed out on his word, and I don’t appreciate that.”</p>\n<p>Other items covered during the meeting included a planned online marketplace for UCSB students to trade and sell textbooks called GauchoBooks, upcoming Human Rights Board elections and changes in and the transition between outgoing and incoming senators.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/","id":3009,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3008,3007,3006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Organizations Lose Funds to  Pardall Center in New Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite opposition from campus groups, the Associated Students Senate decided to pass the budget for the 2014-2015 school year, as proposed by A.S.

President Jonathan Abboud, which increased a “recharge” fee on lock-in fees that are given to specific organizations to give this money to the A.S. Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>Abboud’s budget proposed to increase the recharge on lock-in fees — which is a percentage of the lock-in fee allocated to fund building, leadership and tech reserves — from 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent. A portion of the recharge would go toward sustaining the A.S. Pardall center, for which the association has been seeking a permanent funding source, which drew criticism from several BCCs receiving lock-in fees. Additionally, Abboud proposed a reduction in funding for staff salaries, allocating $40,000 less than requested by staff members, which also drew criticism.</p>\n<p>Despite the concerns brought to the Senate, senators did not change Abboud’s budget except to transfer $3,000 from the senate unallocated fund to tech supplies. The budget passed 11-7.</p>\n<p>Kyle Trager, general manager at KCSB, said the reallocation of funds by Abboud was unfair since it reallocates money in a way that was not approved by students.</p>\n<p>“It is my understanding that this funding will come partly out of the lock-in fees that are allocated to each A.S. entity,” Trager said. “I would like to point out that the students who approved our lock-in fee approved it for KCSB’s usage and did not know that it could be used for this purpose.”</p>\n<p>Trager said he did not understand why, rather than increasing the recharge, the funding for the Pardall Center would not come out of recharges on new lock-in fees which have not yet been allocated.</p>\n<p>“There are a few new lock-in fees that received funding for the first time this year, thus … they have funds that wouldn’t be used by them for any A.S purpose,” Trager said. “My question to you is why were these funds not used for the A.S. Pardall Center?”</p>\n<p>Trager also said he took issue with the idea of cutting staff salaries.</p>\n<p>“I’d also like to give one final shout-out to the staff members that we work with every single day,” Trager said. “Our advisor at the station works crazy hours … I encourage you to strongly reconsider your cuts to staff salaries.”</p>\n<p>Marlene Moreno, Associated Students alumna and current staff member, also said she disagreed with the cuts to staff salaries during Public Forum.</p>\n<p>“If you cut admin salary … it’s not that your admin don’t support you,” Moreno said. “They support you, they get underpaid to support you … They might not be able to afford to actually stay.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting during Public Forum, co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality Hani Tajsar read a letter co-authored by himself and a number of other chairs and members of BCCs. The letter stated that BCCs felt unfairly treated during the process of creating legislation that directly affected them, and presented a list of demands to the elected officials.</p>\n<p>“We, the representatives of the undersigned BCCs, are deeply troubled by the lack of decision-making power BCCs hold,” the letter states. “It is appalling that Associated Students Senate and executives perceive BCCs as inefficient and incapable of carrying out our mission statements in the service of the student body.”</p>\n<p>BCCs demanded in the letter that senators rescind the A.S. bill to restructure, create a committee to research “a governing style that would allow for more BCC decision-making power,” and give BCCs the right to approve financial decisions regarding staff members, because “the majority of staff works closely with the BCCs,” among other things.</p>\n<p>During Abboud’s report to the Senate, he defended his budget decisions.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the alternatives to funding the Pardall Center through the recharge on lock-in fees were to either cut budgets on select groups, or to give up the center completely.</p>\n<p>“The three options in my mind you have are you can keep the recharge … you can get rid of the Pardall Center, or you can cut the budgets of the groups that are in the base fee — essentially SIIRC, creative media, student lobby, the different executive offices,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud also countered arguments against cutting staff salaries by asserting that other students lacked adequate information on the salaries to have an informed opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p>“The people who are upset or complaining … frankly aren’t qualified to comment on staff salaries,” Abboud said. “I’ve been working on this issue with [A.S. Executive Director] Marisela [Marquez] for over a year now, and I’m the only student who is allowed to know all the intricacies of staff salaries.”</p>\n<p>During the Senate discussion on the budget, Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said he agreed with Abboud that taking money from recharges to fund the Pardall Center was necessary in order to ensure enduring use of the center.</p>\n<p>“I think that the way [the recharge] is what we have to do to keep it sustained,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Nikki Calderon advocated moving some money from the Senate unallocated fund, which exists in order to fund new projects that come up over the course of the year, to the funding of the Pardall Center to account for the concerns brought up at public forum.</p>\n<p>After a short discussion on the budget, senators moved into a vote, in which 11 senators voted yes, seven voted no, and none abstained, resulting in a majority in favor of passing the president’s budget.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, a Public Forum speaker further discussed the process of becoming a Community Service District with senators, and elections committee proposed amendments to their role during A.S. elections season.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/organizations-lose-funds-to-pardall-center-in-new-budget/","id":3010,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3009,3008,3007],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The candidates for each position have also been revealed, and OPP’s Ali Guthy will run against DP’s Navi Kaur for A.S. President. Voting will begin next Monday and will take place through GOLD.</p>\n<p>Other OPP and DP candidates running include Beatrice Contreras and Daniela Bayon for External Vice President of Local Affairs and Melvin Singh and Kashira Ayers for External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, respectively. OPP’s Angela Lau will run uncontested for Internal Vice President. Independents Bhrigu Ghandi, Amir Khazaieli and Bailey Loverin will run for Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>Singh, third-year political science and film &amp; media studies double major running for EVPSA, said although elections officially began yesterday the process really started near the end of last quarter.</p>\n<p>“Week seven or eight [of Winter Quarter] was the official declaration of candidacy. That’s when everyone was aware,” Singh said. “It wasn’t completely public yet, but that’s when the whole filing process was, and a week later, that’s when they officially announced the eligible candidates for A.S.”</p>\n<p>Steven Kwok, a first-year economics and accounting major running as an on-campus senator with DP, said the locations of signs depend on the positions that the candidates run for. Those running for executive positions place their signs near Storke Tower, on-campus senators place their signs on paths leading to residence halls and off-campus senators place their signs near Pardall Tunnel.</p>\n<p>“Every senator that has a board has put it somewhere on campus,” Kwok said. “That’s how we’re doing it now. It’s basically a free-for-all, so if you get that spot, you claim that spot.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and chair of the A.S. Elections Committee Claire Fox said her organization is in charge of ensuring that the entire elections process is run in a fair and efficient manner. According to Fox, the elections code includes rules ranging from GPA requirements for candidates to the maximum number of organizations allowed on campus, and students are often the ones who report violations.</p>\n<p>“Students tend to make complaints if they feel there has been a violation with the elections code, and we make a determination and contact the candidate who has been charged or just assess the situation,” Fox said.</p>\n<p>Fiona Hayman, a first-year political science major and voting member on the A.S. Elections Committee, said these next two weeks could be hectic due to the intensity of the campaigning and number of complaints submitted.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received some complaints, but pretty much this week is when campaigning starts, so the complaints will start to roll in, and we’ll be dealing a lot with that,” Hayman said. “The craziness starts now.”</p>\n<p>Fox said the forums being held this week in The Hub will be a good way for students to learn about each candidates’ platforms.</p>\n<p>“If [students are] really concerned about lighting in I.V., they can ask the candidates what their plan is for that,” Fox said. “It’s good to be an informed voter, and the forums really help with that.”</p>\n<p>According to Hayman, next Thursday will be an exciting night full of emotion, as each candidates’ campaigning efforts will come down to either a win or a loss.</p>\n<p>“After [the elections], there’s results night, which is celebratory for some, very sad for some, so that’s an exciting time. And then, it’ll calm down for us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54834\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54834\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/a-s-election-campaigns-ravage-ucsb-campus/","id":3011,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3010,3009,3008],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
