The mommy-pornographic, masturbatory, former <em>Twilight</em> fanfiction fantasy hit that has taken the sexually-frustrated world by storm: “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the movie.</p>\n<p>Now, to this film’s credit, it is <em>not </em>as bad as the book. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack are fine. All the “inner-goddess” monologues (and all inner monologues in general) are not present, and Christian Grey is not as much of an overt jackass here, but the key phrase is “not as much.” However, saying this movie is not as bad as the book is like saying genital warts are better than herpes. One of them may not burn, but they are both a pain in the ass to have in the first place.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, E.L. James’ <em>Fifty Shades</em> was originally a <em>Twilight</em> fanfic, and it shows. Anastasia Steele is Bella Swan sans the suicidal tendencies, but she still makes just as many stupid decisions and is about as complex as a Rubix cube with only one color. Same goes for Grey, who can be summed up as a kinky dick. While there are some implications of a darker past — like an unhappy childhood and a teenage love affair — these details mainly seem to be there to trick you into thinking Grey is complex, because the film barely elaborates on these histories.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But it doesn’t matter since complexities don’t excuse the fact that E.L. James wants you to sympathize with a man who breaks into his girlfriend’s house to have violent sex with her as a reaction to rejection. In short, there is about as much chemistry between Grey and Steele as air and more air. If this is romance, getting up to go to the toilet is exercise.</p>\n<p>But, hell, you don’t care. You’ve already made up your mind about whether or not you’re going to see this. And if you do, you just want to watch kinky sex. Well, I got news for you: it’s a letdown. Yes, there is sex. But it’s tamer than you’d be led to believe. None of the sex scenes last longer than two minutes, and there are so many cutaways and fast camera movements during the BDSM (which isn’t represented properly, ask anyone who actually practices it), that you’d get more stimulation out of reading the book instead. And if you were hoping to see how well-endowed Jamie Dornan or Dakota Johnson is below the belt, prepare for disappointment. It’s pretty much a lose-lose situation.</p>\n<p>And that’s the key word here: disappointment. Those looking for big budget, hardcore porn will leave dry and limp, and those looking for a decent romantic film should just check whatever’s on Netflix.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung needs better stuff to do on Fridays than go see crap like this.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60953\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60953\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-16/fifty-shades-of-grey-still-a-better-love-story-than-actually-not-really/","id":6067,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6066,6065,6064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Honored with the Cinema Vanguard Award “Theory of Everything” Stars Speak to the Nexus on the Red Carpet","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Eddie Redmayne has been on a roll lately.

But last Thursday, Jan. 29 at the Arlington Theatre, both leads were recognized with the Cinema Vanguard Award. The SBIFF tribute celebrated their outstanding careers, particularly their acclaimed performances in “The Theory of Everything.”</p>\n<p>The night began with a red carpet event featuring Redmayne and Jones accompanied by Anthony McCarten, screenwriter of the film. The stars met and greeted fans before walking along the line of reporters, starting with the television journalists and moving down. I waited patiently toward the end of the line, and although Redmayne ran out of time, I did get the opportunity to ask Jones one question: How did she feel about playing such an important role in giving Jane the credit she deserves for the impact she had on Stephen’s life an achievements?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“That’s the whole reason I’m here, because of that woman,” Jones said. “[Jane], in many ways, was a bit of an invisible woman, and it’s been an absolute honor, and very important, to bring her story to light. That has always been the main focus for all of us, in making the film, to shed light on this phenomenal woman.”</p>\n<p>After the meetings with reporters, and when the photographers finished taking all the red carpet snaps they needed, the procession moved inside the theater for the main event. Roger Durling, executive director of the film festival, gave a short speech and introduced Scott Feinberg, writer for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, who moderated the evening. The Q&amp;A was interspersed with three clips from “The Theory of Everything” as well as clips from past films starring the actors including “Savage Grace,” “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables” for Redmayne, and “The Tempest,” “Like Crazy” and “The Invisible Woman” for Jones.</p>\n<p>Feinberg asked them many questions, starting with if they knew each other before the film. The two had met before, having auditioned for a few of the same films, none of which either of them earned, they joked.</p>\n<p>Meeting Stephen and Jane Wilde Hawking was an honor for the pair, and they described how nervous they would get whenever one of the Hawkings visited the set during production. They also talked about the difficulties of portraying the different stages of Stephen’s ALS, which included Jones acting out the changing methods Jane would use as his disease progressed. This was especially difficult considering that scenes, for budget reasons, are not filmed in chronological order. Luckily, both Stephen and Jane loved the actors’ performances, saying it was like watching themselves.</p>\n<p>Drawing away from “Theory,” the two elaborated on their earlier work. Redmayne described his incredibly awkward but amusing experiences playing Julianne Moore’s son in “Savage Grace<em>,</em>” which is about an incestuous mother-son relationship. While filming “My Week with Marilyn<em>,</em>” he remembered how insensitive he sometimes was about how difficult it was for Michelle Williams to play an icon like Marilyn Monroe. The insensitivity came back to haunt him during his trial and tribulations while acting as Stephen.</p>\n<p>Jones also discussed the interesting experience she had filming “Like Crazy.” The film did not have a formal script, just a very detailed story outline around which the actors improvised all of their dialogue. She said this was a difficult but rewarding experience, and did improvisation again with the same director in “Breathe In.”</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A ended with Feinberg introducing screenwriter McCarten to the stage to present the Cinema Vanguard Award. His moving and funny speech praised the stars for their talent, wit and most of all, their young age. “Their combined age is 35,” he joked. He also thanked them for their extraordinary performances that brought his screenplay to life and gave them their award, ending the beautiful night in downtown Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/","id":6064,"author":{"id":758,"name":"Arasch Blurfrushan"},"related":[6063,6062,6061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Panel Highlights Male-Dominance in Film Industry","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bonnie-Arnold-30th-Santa-Barbara-International-LAaGdtUIrfdl.jpg?resize=600%2C419&ssl=1","description":"The phrase “women in show business” conjures a variety of onscreen stereotypes: the distressed damsel, the young clandestine coquette and the sensual temptress, amongst others.

The cause for this can be traced off-screen, where a vast majority of filmmakers and executives are male. The film industry is notoriously difficult to break into, and for an industry that prides itself on progressiveness and liberal values, it is still staggeringly male-dominated in the year 2015. On Feb. 7, six successful women in show business formed the women’s panel at Lobero Theatre and made a dent in this norm, hopefully causing a ripple.</p>\n<p>Bonnie Arnold, Carolyn Blackwood, Kristin Hahn, Rory Kennedy, Aneta Kopacz and Kristina Reed answered questions about their recent films, as well as their careers and what it means to be a female filmmaker and producer. Not only was each woman successful in finding their way in a male-dominated profession, but each panelist told a story of how she enabled the image of a strong female figure either on the screen or in her own life.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a strong female archetype was exemplified in the films of Bonnie Arnold and Carolyn Blackwood, producers of “How to Train Your Dragon 2” and “The Hobbit.” While the “How to Train Your Dragon” book series is devoid of a strong female character, the filmmakers felt it was important to incorporate one into the film. Thus the role of Astrid, a fellow teenage Viking, was born. The role of Galadriel in “The Hobbit” also epitomized a strong female figure. Of Cate Blanchett’s character, Blackwood said, “she kicks a lot of ass” and this was “very, very intentional.” Arnold neatly summed up the need for this type of depictions when she said: “Boys and girls need to see women doing strong things, because if you don’t see it, you can’t even imagine it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kristin Hahn, producer of “Cake,” and Aneta Kopacz, creator of the short film “Joanna” chose to portray women as more realistic heroes in their films. In “Cake,” Jennifer Aniston and her producing partner (and spitting image) consciously decided to center the movie on a woman living with chronic pain, a demographic that is hardly ever portrayed in films. Kopacz tells the story of Joanna, a young mother she read about in an article who was diagnosed with cancer. Kopacz wanted to tell her story, focusing on the bravery and humor exerted in her everyday life with her son, rather than her terminal condition.</p>\n<p>A delightful high point was when Kristina Reed, who worked on the Disney short film “Feast,” a silent animation starring a puppy and a lot of food, went into detail about what goes into making a Disney short. As everything Disney, there are “big stakes and big budgets,” but also a more fun and inclusive attitude surrounding shorts. Everyone in the company, including the security guards and secretary, can pitch their ideas. The winning idea for “Feast” was inspired by an employee who was able to recount his past year through a full account of his 365 dinners using the 1 Second Everyday app. The short meal glimpses were able to tell stories of the year, such as when he was busy on projects and busy with celebratory occasions. Thus the food-based premise of the film was born.</p>\n<p>In contrast to aforementioned indulgent narratives, Rory Kennedy joked that her films range from “depressing to really depressing.” In line with her family’s legacy, she created a documentary recounting the last 24 hours of the Vietnam War. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and left the audience in tears. Kennedy began a career as a reporter, and didn’t think about becoming a filmmaker until she made her first documentary in an effort to expose the untold truth about pregnant women addicted to crack who often cannot find help, in spite of their condition.</p>\n<p>The end segment of the panel consisted of more humorous banter. While discussing the role of male mentors, Hahn chimed that they’re “especially appreciative if you make them look good,” to which Arnold quipped, “I hire that way now.” The cherry on top of the event was a parting gift of postcard sets each donning the countenance of historical women such as Frieda Kahlo and Maya Angelou. While the panel itself was certainly inspiring and uplifting, it would have been nice to see a hint of the racial diversity so prominent in the postcards up onstage.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60860\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60860\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-13/womens-panel-highlights-male-dominance-in-film-industry/","id":6065,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6064,6063,6062],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"My Not so So Ordinary Eight Days as an Intern","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos15.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos15.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The 2015 Santa Barbara Film Festival came to a close this past Sunday.

With it goes the star sightings, the hip boxed water for pass holders and the influx of visitors to downtown Santa Barbara. But what exactly goes into putting this 12-day shindig together? Does some magical movie elf set it all up? Do they sprinkle some elf magic and “POOF!” celebs appear?? Well, not exactly. This event takes months of planning and really couldn’t be executed without the help of hundreds of volunteers and a couple of smart, quick-thinking and creative interns. Like myself, of course.</p>\n<p>Interning with the festival was a unique experience. Meeting new people, learning how to answer phone calls professionally, running errands and playing Cards Against Humanity were just some of the duties on the job. My first day as a Volunteer Coordination intern was overwhelming but exciting. My thoughts ranged from “I can’t do this, I’m going to ruin everything!” to “OMG I wonder if I’ll meet Jen Aniston?!” Unfortunately, that didn’t actually happen, but I did learn the basics of what I would be doing for the next eight days. I also learned that business casual for one organization definitely doesn’t mean the same for them all. I showed up dressed as professionally (and therefore uncomfortably) as I could only to discover these fancy slacks were too much. All around me, hardworking SBIFF staff wore jeans, cardigans and T-shirts. I would soon figure out that working hard doesn’t always require a suit and tie.</p>\n<p>As the week progressed, I got into a rhythm. 10–11 a.m.: Put dozens of checks next to volunteer names when they have showed up for a shift. 11 a.m.–12:30 p.m.: Run to the Lobero or the Arlington to pick up more sign-in sheets. 12:30 p.m.: Lunch time with my fellow interns. This usually consisted of going to my car and discovering I’d parked in the wrong spot. Two parking tickets later, I would definitely pay closer attention in the days to come</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The rest of my shifts consisted of being in the office and observing my boss, Joe, handle shift cancellations or assisting other volunteers who had questions. Yep, this job wasn’t too intense and not very glamorous so far, but it was a good time. During down time, I learned that Cards Against Humanity is totally ok to play at work, just as long as you’re not reading mildly inappropriate cards too loudly.</p>\n<p>Then just when it seemed like I wouldn’t get to participate in any red carpet events, my help was requested for the Michael Keaton Tribute event, and the following week for the Steve Carell event! As it turns out, tribute events are not so glamorous for staff, interns or volunteers, although they did require a little more than business casual for everyone. Precise coordination and planning was necessary. From what I observed as I helped check-in the press, stress levels peaked on the red carpet nights, but SBIFF staff managed to stay positive. I scored free Starbucks from a festival employee who had no problem with the fact that my broke intern self had zero cash.</p>\n<p>Once the stars were escorted inside the fabulous Arlington Theatre, interns were allowed to take a seat as well. As it turns out, I sat three seats away from Michael Keaton that first night, but failed to notice the award winner at the time because I was too busy staring longingly at his son, Sean Douglas.</p>\n<p>From the switch between office antics and serious business time, interning with the festival is an experience that I won’t soon forget. From a paper airplane contest with my fellow interns to attending fancy events, I think it’s safe to say that there is no intern experience quite like this one. You learn not to take yourself too seriously, to work hard when it’s crunch time and to take a step back and take it all in at the end of the night. While there was no magical movie elf working behind-the-scenes, there was definitely some kind of magic at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/my-not-so-so-ordinary-eight-days-as-an-intern/","id":6066,"author":{"id":744,"name":"Brianna Guzman"},"related":[6065,6064,6063],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
