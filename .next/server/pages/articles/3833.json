April 2, 1:15 a.m. – An utterly defeated frat boy was found passed out on the bike path on El Colegio late Thursday night by a patrolling CSO.<br>\n\tThe CSO woke the inebriated man, who stood up, walked straight toward the closest apartment and walked in. When the officers arrived some minutes later, they found the sloppy squatter sitting in a large, comfy armchair. The disheveled residents were in the corner, scared.<br>\n\tThe deputies approached the residents who assured the officers they did not know the drunken fool sitting in their living room.<br>\n\tBut when presented with this information, the obtrusive 20-year-old insisted they were in his frat house. And then, as only a frat guy could, he told the officers the others were just mad at him because he was going to take their girls.<br>\n\tThe girls, however, were safe for tonight. After failing to point toward home, the deputies arrested the drunk frat boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>The Park Bench Saga</b><br>\nSat. April 3, 12:45 p.m. – Deputies enjoying a sunny afternoon were forced into action when they passed an unusual sight on Embarcadero Del Mar.<br>\n\tThe deputies were walking by a park when they spotted a solitary adult male sprinting around a bench. Upon making a sharp turn, the day-drinker lost his footing and fell on his face.<br>\n\tThe officers approached to check on his welfare, but before they could reach him, the grass-stained 26-year-old rolled over to face the bench and shouted, “I’m going to kick your ass.”<br>\n\tWhen the deputies got closer, they recognized the fallen partier from earlier, when they had issued him a citation for having an open container.<br>\n\tWhen the officers attempted to help him to his feet, he told them he wasn’t going anywhere and fell back down. The deputies disagreed, however, and dragged him to a patrol car, which drove him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Home, Sweet, 109</b><br>\nSun. April 4, 5:09 a.m. – Deputies responding to an early morning disturbance entered the apartment complex and spotted the perpetrator leaning against the door to Apt. 109.<br>\n\tThe officers walked up and asked the man where he lived.<br>\n\t“Right here,” the early morning drunk said.<br>\n\tAnd where’s here, the officers asked.<br>\n\t“Right here, 109.”<br>\n\tAnd what’s the address of here?<br>\n\t“1009.”<br>\n\tHoping for an original answer, the deputies asked the 19-year-old how he’d gotten “here.”<br>\n\t“Right here, 109.”<br>\n\tWhile the confused youngster may not have known where he came from, the deputies sure knew where he was going: they arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-09/police-blotter-53/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-09/police-blotter-53/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-09/police-blotter-53/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-09/police-blotter-53/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-09/police-blotter-53/","id":3833,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3832,3831,3830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled \"Man down!\" from their front door.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Sleepy in Chicago</b><br>\n<i>Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m.</i> — Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled “Man down!” from their front door.</p>\n<p>The deputies walked over and found a young man, his clothes soiled with dirt and God knows what else, completely passed out in the gravel beside the driveway of the house.</p>\n<p>After unsuccessfully attempting to wake the defeated drunkard, the officers called in the medical response team on fears of alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old man, who woke as the paramedics arrived, was not happy and repeatedly shouted “fuck” and asked why it was necessary for them to assist him.</p>\n<p>After getting the OK from the paramedics, the officers arrested the inebriated, insolent man for public intoxication.

When asked his age, the inebriated man told them he was 21. The deputies wanted to see his ID, however, and, releasing his arm, told him to get it.</p>\n<p>His arm now free, the pasty man made a break for it and started sprinting down the street. His escape was short lived, however, and he was quickly tackled. The deputies searched his pockets and found a passport — a Russian passport.</p>\n<p>The officers arrested the 19-year-old Russian reveler for evading a police officer and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Can You Point Me to the Sex Castles?</b><br>\n<i>Sat., Feb. 13, 1:43 a.m.</i> — An especially rude freshman staggering down the 6700 block of Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>With whiskey on his breath, the 19-year-old had a wicked tongue, shouting obscenities at anyone who passed.

He was then put in a patrol car — where he again vomited — and driven to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where, surprise, he threw up again.</p>\n<p>With nothing left in his stomach, they housed the not-so-fresh prince, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-18/police-blotter-49/","id":3830,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3829,3828,3827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. -- A manly expletive (\"Fuck!\") drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Dishonorably Drunk</b></p>\n<p>Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. — A manly expletive (“Fuck!”) drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>Looking around for the source, the deputies spotted a well-built young man staggering down the street, all alone.

The first theft was Friday, May 7 when five laptops were stolen from a residence on the 6500 block of Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>“The suspect entered into the unlocked house,” Padilla said. “I don’t believe it. These kids need to lock their doors and windows.”</p>\n<p>Several other laptops were stolen throughout the weekend. A computer was stolen from a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road on Saturday afternoon and two laptops were stolen from a parked car on Estero Road later that evening.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon another theft occurred when a suspect entered an unlocked car on the 6700 block Sabado Tarde Road and stole a laptop computer and a TomTom navigation device.</p>\n<p>Vandals also targeted a number of parked cars this weekend.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol deputies were called to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road when an unknown suspect shattered the window of a young woman’s vehicle. Deputies also noted several reports of smashed side-view mirrors.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol deputies issued eight citations for public intoxication, in addition to 17 citations for minors in possession of alcohol and possession of open containers in public.</p>\n<p>Despite the alcohol-related crimes and high amount of thefts over the weekend, Deputy Freddy Padilla said no life-threatening incidents took place.</p>\n<p>“There were no violent crimes, nothing outrageous and, thankfully, no sexual assaults this weekend,” Padilla said. “I just hope that these kids lock their cars and houses and keep their valuables out of plain sight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/","id":3832,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3831,3830,3829],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
