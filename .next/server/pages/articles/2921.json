Main Office, located inside the MultiCultural Center. The proposed entrance would allow entrance to the A.S. Office from the exterior of the building, unlike than the interior entrance that currently exists. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy presented a proposal to create a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) during <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/\">last week’s A.S. Senate meeting</a> in response to what she claims is student-need as described in the Vision 2020 A.S. Student Strategic Plan.</p>\n<p>The proposal, according to Guthy, is a response to the A.S. Student Strategic Plan released in Spring 2014, which laid out A.S.’s goals for the next five years. Under the proposal, the second floor of the outdoor MCC patio area will be changed to a conference room that will be predominantly used by A.S. officials.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology major Guthy, there are plenty of reasons to have a new entrance, since she claims that the current space is “bunker-like” and “inaccessible” to students.</p>\n<p>“Although the association has done its best to advertise its location, the bunker-like structure inhibits open access to the space and its resources,” Guthy said. “Associated Students is funded entirely by students and serves to facilitate student needs. I find it troubling that this space isn’t readily open and accessible to all students, given that students are the ones paying for it.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students. – AS President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>MCC office manager Enma Elias however said that the idea of a new entrance is “nice,” but that MCC employees would like things to stay the same.</p>\n<p>“It definitely would be nice to see this proposal, but from what I know, we want to keep things the same,” Elias said. “Especially because the outdoor patio area outside of the MCC entrance is always used for conferences each summer and spring by people outside of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Although the proposal has not been approved by Senate, Guthy said it will benefit future students, particularly student leaders, for informational purposes.</p>\n<p>“Future student leaders, over the next few years, could continue to contribute information to this space and feature information that they find necessary,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>MCC co-chair and third year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker said she opposes Guthy’s plan because Guthy did not ask for input from the MCC co-chairs.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the idea of this proposal at all. Ali did not have the courtesy to discuss this with [co-chair Anumita Kaur] and I, and I find that extremely unfair,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As MCC co-chairs we should have been involved in the process of developing this idea as this construction will absolutely obstruct MCC affairs.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, Guthy’s proposal, if acted upon, could obstruct other non-student government bodies from properly organizing.</p>\n<p>“The MCC is the only place that marginalized groups (people of color and/or LGBTQ) have to organize, study and have social/political gatherings,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>However, Guthy said students have always had a specific demand for greater accessibility to the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>According to Elias, the current lack of space on campus will only be exacerbated should plans for the new entrance come to fruition.</p>\n<p>“Corwin Pavilion has a patio right outside of our main entrance. Corwin needs their space as well and I don’t think they’d like that idea,” Elias said. “UCen lacks space too and all these building are near so it’s all relative: There’s a lack of space … It’s actually really cramped in here.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged? – MCC co-chair Ashley Baker</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year film &amp; media studies major and MCC media designer A.J. Price said she also does not agree with Guthy’s proposal and plans to “vote against it for sure” if it is proposed to the student body.</p>\n<p>Second-year French and economics-accounting major and Democratic Process (DP) party senator Steven Kwok however said the new entrance would be beneficial because it would provide students with direct access to the A.S. Main Office and would thus allow students to be “more connected to their government.”</p>\n<p>“I think the new entrance to the MCC is a great idea,” Kwok said in an email. “The student body will be able to directly access AS through the entrance instead of having to enter through the hall that extends to the main corridor of the MCC. This gives AS a face to the outside beyond the lettering that is currently on the building.”</p>\n<p>Former Open People’s Party (OPP) senator and fourth-year political science major Marvin Ramirez said the university lacks student space and that students can benefit “greatly” from the new space should it be constructed.</p>\n<p>“Seeing as people out in I.V. are now charging students for their access to study spaces, spacing has been a large issue,” Ramirez said. “The university accepts more students which is awesome, but remains the same structurally inside. This cannot always be the case so a new conference room space may be of great value. Creating a new conference room that may potentially be a long-term investment is not a bad thing.”</p>\n<p>However, Baker said the proposal and conference room renovation is an example of what she alleges is elitist decision-making favoring “white and hetero-normative” OPP affiliates who she claims will not solve space issues that benefit people of color.</p>\n<p>“Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged?” Baker said in an email. “Where are the fruits of their labor? We must note that the university was physically built and is still preserved by the muscle by countless economically deprived people of color. Look at how they have cornered El Centro with the library renovation.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, enacting Guthy’s proposed renovation will continue to unevenly distribute space to a student group that has “more than enough.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe this change to be necessary as they have more than enough space. Half of the university belongs to them. How inconsiderate can one be is my question?” Baker said in an email. “If this proposal is passed future generations will once again have to fight for an area that was already theirs.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/a-s-proposal-divides-the-mcc/","id":2921,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2920,2919,2918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva","biography":"Not available","articles":[2755,2842,2861,2873,2882,2911,2921,2929,2956,4704,4725,4746,4753,4762,4784],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"How to Train Your Sports Editor: It’s Time for a Change, Even  if it’s Actually Too Late","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I think it’s about time for me to start complaining a little bit.

The worst example is soccer because I’m not good at soccer. As I mentioned in a previous column, I have no foot-eye coordination. This has resulted in a mid-season stat line that goes something like no goals on five shots — none of them on goal —while allowing four goals while playing goalie. It’s been rough.</p>\n<p>What makes it even more rough is that not all of those goals I allowed were my fault! If you can bend a ball into the back corner of the net from 30 yards out, you should not be enrolled in a class called ‘Beginning Soccer.’ If you can juke me so hard that I eat shit into the turf, I don’t want to see you there. Most importantly, if you take some sick, twisted joy out of doing the above things to soccer newbies such as myself, get out of my class.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It goes the other way, too. I took beginning tennis two years ago because I had never really played the game. Even if I don’t have foot-eye coordination, I have some semblance of hand-eye, putting me a step above the people who were out there just to get some activity.</p>\n<p>So how do we solve this problem? First of all, a lot of the responsibilities lie with the teachers of the classes. If someone isn’t even learning new techniques or strategies, why is s/he wasting a given teacher’s time? It’s hard to categorize people, though, and especially so to cut it down to just three categories.</p>\n<p>My solution is to introduce more levels of each class, depending on the sport and divided by technique. Sure, there should still be introductory classes just so you can investigate a sport you may be interested in. But do you want to have the biggest tennis serve on the Rob Gym courts? Take the once-weekly class entitled ‘Tennis: Serves.’ Want to add a baseline game to that? Sign up for ‘Tennis: Groundstrokes.’ Easy as pie.</p>\n<p>This way, the whole problem of competition is eradicated. “But I love competition,” you say. Well, so do I. Fear not, the competition is still to be had, in intramural sports. I say that anyone enrolled in an ESS class should also be on an intramural team, where teams are decided by a brief tryout in the first week. If you feel as if you’ve been misplaced after that, find a new team that will have you and get to it.</p>\n<p>ESS is being removed from the curriculum because it’s costly, not because it’s necessarily a badly-run program. But there are problems with it. Who knows, maybe if they had worked out a kink or two, people would be able to get their exercise on freely. Against evenly matched competition, of course.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-31/train-sports-editor-time-change-late/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-31/train-sports-editor-time-change-late/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-31/train-sports-editor-time-change-late/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-31/train-sports-editor-time-change-late/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-31/train-sports-editor-time-change-late/","id":2918,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2917,2916,2915],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bet on the Packers’ Offense","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This Super Bowl is particularly exciting for me.

He leads nearly every passing statistic and has dominated thus far, dismissing Michael Vick, Matty Ice and Jay Cutler on the way. With running back James Starks and wide receiver Greg Jennings, the Packers have averaged 30 points per game, making them the most dangerous offense in the postseason. Their defense, led by Clay Matthews and Tramon Williams, has fared just as well, limiting the opposition to just 17 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Steelers are led by perennially troubled quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who just doesn’t understand the meaning of the word “no.” Just ask defenses around the league or folks of Milledgeville, Georgia. What “Big Ben” lacks in integrity, he makes up for in hardware. At age 28, he is already playing in his third Super Bowl, winning in his previous two appearances. After sitting out the first four games of this year, “Big Ben” found his rhythm again, producing yet another solid season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, everyone knows that Pittsburgh’s true strength is in its defense, which is limiting opponents to just 14.5 points per game. Linebacker Lawrence Timmons has 19 tackles in just two games and Troy Polamalu is a constant pest to any offense.</p>\n<p>No one doubts that the Steelers defense is good, but can they contain the smokin’ hot Rodgers? I think not. This weekend, Rodgers is going to add some actual hardware to go along with his championship belt. Nothing is stopping Rodgers from getting his first ring. Not Big Ben and not the Steelers defense.</p>\n<p>I’m betting big on the Packers expecting Rodgers to deliver me a big pay day, but if I lose, I won’t dwell on it. After all, according to The Hangover, “Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Except for herpes. That shit stays with you.”</p>\n<p><strong>Prediction: Green Bay Over Pittsburgh 21-17</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32686\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-01/bet-packers-offense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32686\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-01/bet-packers-offense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-01/bet-packers-offense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-01/bet-packers-offense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-01/bet-packers-offense/","id":2919,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2918,2917,2916],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Event Honors Michael D.

Young has been at the university with the division of Student Affairs since 1990.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Affairs Debbie Fleming said Young and his wife have made positive and lasting impacts on the university and that Young will leave behind a legacy for vice chancellors in Students Affairs to come.</p>\n<p>“JoAnne has shared Michael with us for the last 25 years, so we are forever grateful to JoAnne and the entire family, many of whom are here,” Fleming said. “Michael Young’s values — honesty, transparency, integrity, collaboration and teamwork — are at the foundation of the positive and supportive community that we treasure at the Student Affairs Division.”</p>\n<p>Marina Quintanilla, a second-year biology major and a student assistant in Young’s office, said Young will be missed by students and staff alike.</p>\n<p>“It is going to be so sad going into the office and not seeing him everyday,” Quintanilla said. “We are used to seeing him meet with numerous people throughout the whole week and he is just very nice and very caring for the students and now that he is gone it is going to be the saddest thing ever.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, along with Assembly member Das Williams, presented Young with a framed resolution to recognize and honor his time with the university.</p>\n<p>“Not only has Michael demonstrated wise and experienced leadership in his position but he has launched countless initiatives that have become the models throughout the country in areas including creation of student wellness programs, an issue of great concern I know to all of us at this time,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Young has influenced the high voter registration campaigns and turnout at the university.</p>\n<p>“He made it a value,” Williams said, “He made a recognition of the administration that having students and faculty register to vote and participate in our government was an important value to have.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful. So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you. – Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williams also said Young was a leader in the move to improve energy efficiency efforts on campus, including the Zero Net Energy Plan, an initiative to help ensure energy efficient spending at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the implementation of the Zero Net Energy Plan, UCSB will be more energy efficient in the years to come and will be more instep with our values so that we are not creating as much human pain by the energy choices that we have as a community,” Williams said, “and that is because Dr. Michael Young thought it was important and helped move that forward.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Congresswoman Lois Capps, whose late husband Walter H. Capps was a professor on the committee that chose Young as Vice Chancellor, said Young has “enriched” the university throughout his career and his “noble work.”</p>\n<p>“Michael, how you touch the individuals, during that formative time in a person’s life, when they are a college student,” Capps said, “That translates into a wider community now.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet. Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>Executive Director of Housing and Residential Services Willie Brown said Young was a constant role model to the African-American community on campus.</p>\n<p>“Michael has given his heart when a heart was needed for balance, when a heart was needed to even out the odds,” Brown said. “Michael has been a friend to anyone who needed a friend, he has connected those who have no connection.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy said she first met Young at the emergency response meeting following the shooting in May and that it was during that time that Young revealed himself as a pillar of strength for “the entire UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>“Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet,” Guthy said. “Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives.”</p>\n<p>Young said that among the things he has done during his time at the university, his development of a solar energy sustainability initiative, his support for the LGBTQIA community, his improvements in regard to mental health services and other projects are among those he is most proud of.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful,” Young said. “So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you.”</p>\n<p>Young said the Student Affairs Division will be in good hands with current Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, when she fills his position after his official retirement on Jan 31.</p>\n<p>“Those of you that know Mary know that she is smart, she is committed, she has strict, great values, [and is] a strong person with even stronger principle values,” Young said. “I want to thank you all for being such great colleagues and friends. We have had some great times together working hard, debating, arguing, laughing, playing and I just want to thank you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/","id":2920,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2919,2918,2917],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
