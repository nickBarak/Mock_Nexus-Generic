He also had “a dirty white beard, [was] wearing mussed clothing or dirty in appearance.” He may be driving an older, four-door gray car that looks “similar to a Chevy Volt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first victim said her attacker “smelled heavily of alcohol”; the second said he smelled like marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Tuesday evening, he has not been apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first assault occurred on Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. along a creek near Phelps Road and Ocean Walk Lane, when the suspect grabbed a 22-year-old female jogger by the shoulder and arm “in an attempt to pull her closer to him,” according to an initial </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-10/timely-warning-issued-for-assault-on-campus-adjacent-property/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim punched at the suspect in an attempt to break free, but the suspect then “grabbed the victim by her shoulders and punched her in the face,” according to the initial timely warning. She was able to break free and run back to her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim sustained “redness and swelling” to her face during the assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second assault occurred Monday evening at approximately 10:30 p.m. An 18-year-old female was waiting for friends by her car in the Haskell’s Beach parking area in Goleta when she noticed a man sitting in a dark-colored vehicle nearby, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man then approached her, placed his hand on her back and asked her if she was OK. He then “reached under the front of her shirt and sexually assaulted her,” according to the release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim then “kicked at the suspect, striking him in the groin area.” She then ran to her friends for help, while the suspect fled to his vehicle and drove away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proximity of the attacks, similar suspect descriptions and similar locations, being “isolated areas near rural access,” led the Sheriff’s Office to believe the assaults were perpetrated by the same suspect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone with more information about the suspect can contact the department at (805) 681-4100 or submit an anonymous report </span><a href=\"http://www.sbsheriff.org/anonymoustips.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Simren Verma / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Steinhorn, a third-year communication major, and Adri Davies, a third-year political science major, have been close friends since their freshman year when they were matched as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two got the idea to start a podcast about the lack of knowledge students have about A.S. during a class they took together last quarter: Writing for Public Discourse (105PD), an upper-division writing class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final project in the class was to put together an advocacy campaign, and Steinhorn and Davies decided to create a 30-minute podcast titled “Apathy Unveiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, this first episode of “Apathy Unveiled” is the only podcast the two have created but they plan to make more about A.S. and even expand to new topics, such as UCSB’s Greek system and national politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know a lot of the stuff that we ended up reporting on and covering until we started doing the research,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I think a lot of it also stemmed from our own curiosity about A.S. elections and how A.S. works.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the beginning of the podcast, Steinhorn spoke to how UCSB students seem to care about national politics, but not A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has one of the highest student voting populations out of public universities,” Steinhorn said. “But somehow, we have failed… to even get half the student body to vote in any recent [A.S.] elections.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn’s and Davies’ perspectives differ from that of current A.S. elected officials and candidates. Many students – including those currently running in the Spring Quarter 2019 elections – emphasize that the student body is unaware of A.S.’s budget due to a lack of transparency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies disagree. They find the root of the problem to be apathetic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Steinhorn and Davies began researching for the podcast, they decided to look into A.S.’s level of transparency for themselves and ended up finding A.S.’s budget almost immediately, Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue is not that we don’t have information or that it’s not transparent,” Davies said in the podcast. “You Google UCSB A.S. budget and it’s like the second link.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have no idea what’s going on, students that do run for positions know that they can get away with whatever they want basically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies then went on in the podcast to discuss the disqualification of former External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA)-elect Mayela Morales and the subsequently vacant EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has tried to elect a new representative, and we have continually not been able to get enough student voters to allow that representative into their position,” Steinhorn said in the podcast, referring to the failed A.S. special elections held this past school year in an attempt to elect an EVPSA.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn re-emphasized that she believes the reason behind the vacant EVPSA position is largely due to apathetic students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies spent a bulk of the podcast, however, arguing that many students do not know the reality of how much money A.S. controls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy to attribute inaction to the lack of transparency, but then when we found that there was a lot of transparency… it’s like, okay then, what is the actual problem?” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “That kind of led us to talking to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies clarified that she believes it is hard to understand what happens inside of A.S. and what exactly is on A.S. elected officials’ agendas, noting that it is the budget and the financial information that she thinks is transparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Steinhorn and Davies asked UCSB students what they knew about A.S. and how much money they thought the A.S. budget was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student guessed $20,000, and another guessed $500,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of them missed the mark by a longshot. Steinhorn and Davies told each student they interviewed that A.S.’s budget for this school year was $13.8 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students responded with gasps, one exclaimed “Oh my god!” and one even said, “For what? What do they do?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steinhorn and Davies also asked the students if they knew how much each student individually pays A.S. with their fees and asked the students if they knew that the A.S. executive elected officials get most of their tuition paid through honoraria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with interviewing students not involved in A.S., they also interviewed an A.S. insider, who wanted to remain anonymous, and asked the insider to explain what exactly A.S. is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I’ve noticed on this campus is there is a small group of people who are politically engaged, and they end up determining a lot of student-wide issues… that not necessarily a majority of students would want,” the A.S. insider said during the podcast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the theme of apathy, Steinhorn and Davies stressed that they believe there is an issue of accessibility to A.S. Although they think that students can do more, they also believe that A.S. can do more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people probably view university government as more of a club than a body that actually makes decisions,” Steinhorn said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s kind of like this selective group. It seems, at least from the outside, hard to break in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davies then joined in on expressing her frustration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are these people being picked?

In addition to the 35 residential burglaries in the month of July, the IVFP also received 28 reports of miscellaneous burglary and two reports of auto burglary, Vuillemainroy said.</p>\n<p>“The biggest crimes we have been seeing this summer are burglaries,” Vuillemainroy said. “A lot of this happens while kids are out partying and having fun, forgetting to lock their doors and take their keys. … Students need to make sure that they have the keys to their residences every time they leave in order to prevent crime.”</p>\n<p>One of the first burglaries of the month took place on July 3, when a victim awoke to the sound of footsteps in his apartment on the 800 block of Embarcadero del Norte. The resident saw a thief using the light of a cell phone to navigate the apartment before making off with a flat screen television and a computer.</p>\n<p>Similar incidents continued throughout the month, including an instance of thieves striking two apartments in the same building on the 900 block of Camino del Sur.</p>\n<p>In addition to investigating residential burglaries, Foot Patrol deputies also responded to several violent crimes during the month of July, including two cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol officers were called to the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive on July 25 after a 19-year-old man reportedly raped a woman. Vuillemainroy said the survivor was assaulted after her roommates had allowed the man into their apartment.</p>\n<p>“He then stepped into the woman’s bedroom where he forcibly raped her,” Vuillemainroy said. “She yelled for help and her roommates rushed to her and pulled him off.”</p>\n<p>Authorities later identified and arrested the man in an in-field line-up.</p>\n<p>Other cases of physical assault were reported, including an incident on the evening of July 24 where three men harassed people with a stun gun at three separate parties.</p>\n<p>“The men were threatening to stun people with a stun gun,” Vuillemainroy said. “One person was actually stunned but is okay now.”</p>\n<p>Authorities successfully arrested the assailants.</p>\n<p>Deputies also responded to a standard number of vandalisms and alcohol-related crimes during July. Officers wrote 28 drunk in public citations during the month and took reports of nine vandalisms.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/police-blotter-62/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/police-blotter-62/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/police-blotter-62/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/police-blotter-62/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/police-blotter-62/","id":3683,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3682,3681,3680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ask Me Anything: Questions About A.S.

Senate resolutions actually affect university policy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direct percentage of Senate resolutions that affect university policy. There are several different types of bills/resolutions that the Senate passes, but the main two are positional and directional resolutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional bill/resolution is one that “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events.” Positional resolutions require a two thirds vote. For example, a positional resolution passed this past year was one in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-passes-three-resolutions-in-support-of-afscme-strike-one-which-suspends-a-s-operations-in-solidarity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support of the AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional bill/resolution is one that “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, Committees and/or the Senate to specific duties.” A directional resolution requires a 50% plus 1 vote – in the case of the 69th Senate, 13 votes. One example of a directional resolution passed by the Senate during this past year is “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/new-resolution-keeps-former-a-s-advisor-kings-legacy-alive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which awards five students each a $500 grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further details about the types of bills and resolutions that the Senate can pass begins on page 313 of Legal Code under the Policy 6: Main Motions section in the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do my student fees go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the 2018-2019 school year, students pay $631.83 in A.S. and Graduate Student Association (GSA) fees and $1,188.87 in lock-in fees – overall, paying $1,820.70 in student fees each school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student fees given to A.S. fund Arts &amp; Lectures, the Child Care Center, Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.), Disabled Student Services, the Events Center, intramural sports, the Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Student Life, Recreational Sports, the Coastal Fund, Student Health and the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students fees designated as lock-in fees include Arts &amp; Lectures, bike path maintenance, a second C.L.A.S. fee, Career Services, C.A.P.S., E.O.P., Event Center, the Green Initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fund (TGIF)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health &amp; Wellness, a second MCC fee, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Recreation Center among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fees fall under both of these categories, such as two separate MCC fees and two C.L.A.S. fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact breakdown of fees for the 2018-2019 school year can be found <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/2018-19cbf.pdf?sfvrsn=6518aa46_2\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were both parties founded? Why do they have a rivalry? How are they related to OPP and DP parties?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United was founded in Feb. 2016, and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran candidates for the first time </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the Spring Quarter 2016 elections. The Isla Vista Party was founded in Feb. 2017 and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran candidates for the first time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Spring Quarter 2017 Elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Open People’s Party (OPP) ran candidates in an election was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2015.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2015.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2016 that many former OPP members “now identify with the new groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Democratic Process Party (DP) ran candidates was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2014-Election-Results.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2014</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cannot speak to the rivalry between the two. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do the candidates plan to lower student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, only one candidate – presidential candidate Alison Sir – has said she wanted to lower student fees. The other presidential candidate, Zion Solomon, said during the presidential candidate forum that they would like to keep student fees the same, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the minimum voting percentage threshold needed to win if a candidate is unopposed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in A.S. Legal Code, at least 20% of all eligible undergraduate students must vote in the election for it to be valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual candidates, Elections Board uses the Droop Quota to calculate the minimum number of voters needed for a candidate to be elected. The formula is as follows: Votes Needed = (Valid Votes Cast / Number of Seats + 1) + 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further information about the quota can be found on page 298 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is a special election? Is this a special election?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a special election. A special election can happen when a position within the executive offices – such as the president, EVPLA, EVPSA, IVP or S.A.G. – becomes vacant. Special election rules are controlled by Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, there have been two special elections: the first in Fall Quarter 2018 and the second in Winter Quarter 2019. Both elections attempted to fulfill the vacant EVPSA position; during both, less than the minimum required number of students voted, invaliding the results. </span></p>\n<p><b>Who is advising elections? Who are members of the committee in charge of elections? Do we get to see the minutes?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board is in charge of the elections. There are seven members of the board, and they are advised by Kendra Sandoval and Ruth Garcia Guevara. Election Board minutes are not open to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are on Elections Board cannot run for any senatorial or executive position or be a representative for any campus political party. </span></p>\n<p><b>Is results night still in the UCen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Results night will happen in the UCen’s Hub at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. </span></p>\n<p><b>What endorsements besides the </b><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b> can candidates get? Is there a list? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is not an explicit list of who can endorse, but rather only a list of who cannot endorse candidates. As stated in Legal Code, all A.S. entities cannot endorse candidates and parties. Further details about endorsements can be found on page 283 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 22, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why doesn’t A.S. have greater authority over the Isla Vista area?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. has representation within I.V. through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) position, held by third-year global studies major Jeike Meijer. The EVPLA can advocate on behalf of UCSB students’ needs in I.V., but they cannot make direct changes to laws; instead, they work with governmental bodies that make those decisions, such as the I.V. Recreation and Parks District and the I.V. Community Service District, to make change within the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB owns property in I.V., but cannot control or make decisions over I.V. as a whole because, by nature, the two are separate. UCSB is a university; I.V. is an unincorporated district – and home to families, private businesses and more, not just students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because UCSB and I.V.’s histories are so intertwined, there are ways in which the university can directly or indirectly exert influence over what happens in I.V. For example, the university has a representative on the I.V. CSD, who serves as a coordinator between the two entities. Additionally, UCSB gives a $200,000 grant to the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates for this year’s EVPLA election are third-year political science Matthew Griffin and third-year environmental studies major Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of compensation do A.S. members receive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. executive director and other full-time staff members within A.S. receive yearly salaries. For example, the current A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez, received $110,911 for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executives receive $3,000 per quarter, while A.S. senators receive $400 dollars per quarter for serving on the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both face different sets of rules and requirements, which can be found in A.S. legal code. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the Daily Nexus have beef with the A.S. Senate? What’s up with always criticizing their shortcomings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not “have beef” with the A.S. Senate. Just as with any other relationship between reporters and the government officials they cover, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports on both the Senate’s shortfalls and its successes. As a campus newspaper, it is important that we hold A.S. accountable because, after all, the same people who read the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the ones giving A.S. their money to spend. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the ideological differences between CU and I.V. party?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our endorsement interviews, we asked each candidate running for an executive position about the difference between Campus United and the Isla Vista Party, and they all gave various vague answers. Some candidates said their party thinks outside of the box, while others said their party was like a family to them. The executive candidates also emphasized that they would not speak about the opposing party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United has a website that includes information about its platform: </span><a href=\"https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party has a Facebook page that is regularly updated. However, there aren’t many details on the page regarding the party’s platform and ideologies: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/</span></a></p>\n<p><b>Where can I view a list of candidates?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A list of all candidates can be seen on our website <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the programs that come from my student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing Senate with a budget to spend throughout the year, your student fees fund a variety of different programs across campus. For example, the A.S. Program Borard is funded by student fees, as well as the Bike Shop, Queer Commission, Food Bank and many others. You can find the full list of A.S. funded entities here: </span><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 16, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student enrolled at UCSB pays </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.61 every quarter to Associated Students to go toward “a wide variety of operations of Associated Students that benefit the students of UCSB, the campus and the surrounding community,” as written on the A.S. Finance and Business website. This amounts to an estimated $14 million a year, as of last reported numbers. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the different A.S. positions? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. serves as an umbrella for dozens of organizations. The most well-known divisions of A.S. include the legislative branch (the A.S. Senate), the executive branch (the A.S. Executives) and the judicial branch (the A.S. Judicial Council). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the A.S. Senate, there are 25 senatorial positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 25 senators are elected based on different constituencies; there are 12 off-campus senator seats, five on-campus senator seats, four Letters &amp; Science senator seats, one College of Engineering senator seat, one College of Creative Studies senator seat, one transfer senator seat and one university-owned off-campus senator seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no College of Creative Studies senator for the past school year, and no students have declared candidacy for the seat this year’s election as of press time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the executive branch, there are five A.S. executive positions: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBASOP/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ivpucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal vice president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IVP), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbEVPSA/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB6ux9CZOA9eMPbLvNNLuo5kIGZGoj3jtgxwRvfm0rLaYKe9A5qbzuS2FCpyxrzSJFwR85Z0BVYmuyX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for statewide affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPSA), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evplaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for local affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPLA) and the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/osaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student advocate general</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (S.A.G.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPSA position has been vacant since Spring Quarter 2018 following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales and the two subsequent special elections that failed to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president serves as a representative of UCSB at the systemwide level and is a voice for students within the UCSB administration. They also work on projects within their own office to enhance the UCSB student experience and sit on various committees around campus. The IVP presides over the A.S. Senate, and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The EVPLA works with local government bodies, such as the I.V. Community Services District and the I.V. Recreation and Park District. The EVPSA advocates for UCSB student issues at the state and federal level. Finally, the S.A.G. heads up the Office of the Student Advocate, which provides support for students/student groups who are involved in a dispute with the university.</span></p>\n<p><b>How can you reach out to your senators and other executives?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to contact your senators and executives. As of this year, the 69th senate passed a resolution that requires senators to provide their constituencies with an official Facebook page. A.S. executives also have official Facebook pages, where you will find their office hours, the location of their office hours, contact info and projects they are currently undertaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the entire Senate as a whole, students or community members can speak at public forum during weekly Senate meetings, which begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Flying A room of the University Center. The Senate does not hold meetings during Week 10 or finals week. </span></p>\n<p><b>When does voting begin?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting officially begins on April 22 at 8 a.m., or Monday of Week 4. It ends on April 25 at 4 p.m. The results will be announced on April 25 at a time and place to be determined. Log onto G.O.L.D. to cast your vote.</span></p>\n<p>A full version of A.S.
