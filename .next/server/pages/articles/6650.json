Tyler will be gracing us with his presence at Campbell Hall this Friday, courtesy of A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>With the summer release of the critically-acclaimed <em>Flower Boy</em>, Tyler took listeners on an excursion into his jazz-funk world. <em>Flower Boy</em> is the sonic equivalent of riding in a baby blue LaFerrari at the highest speed, blaring BadBadNotGood through the speakers. The album allowed for all of the previous enigmas of Tyler, the Creator we once knew to come together to form an album that smoothly flows from track to track, with jazzy drums exuding through a majority of the album. The excellent production on <em>Flower Boy</em> diverged from the experimental stampeding and chords of its 2015 predecessor, <em>Cherry Bomb</em>. Most fans that knew Tyler from <em>Wolf</em> and Odd Future ran away once they heard the distorted instrumentals combined with blaring bass on <em>Cherry Bomb</em>. Yet the introduction of <em>Flower Boy</em> saw an onslaught of new fans that weren’t so appreciative of Tyler’s earlier works <em>Bastard</em> and <em>Goblin</em>. In the split-screen “FLOWER BOY: a Conversation” moderated by comedian Jerrod Carmichael, Tyler credits the change in his fan demographic due to his inclination for “making pop music.” Carmichael tells Tyler that “Boredom” is Tyler’s equivalent to Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean.” The track “Boredom” has struck a chord with people that share the same confusing boredom when they are stuck in suburbia. Regarding performing “Boredom” on the Coachella stage this April, Tyler responded with a blunt, nonchalant, “Let me shut up and do a hook, so the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit.”</p>\n<p>Tyler stated that he did not want to get personal on <em>Cherry Bomb</em>, but “just wanted to make songs.” Meanwhile, when producing <em>Flower Boy</em>, Tyler wanted to create feel-good anthems he would find people jamming to in the middle of the club — similar to how his primary inspiration, Pharrell Williams, entices listeners with waves of funk throughout his songs. Tyler attributes the songwriting process of <em>Flower Boy</em> to simultaneous feelings of loneliness and joy he expresses throughout the album. The inner workings of these songs humanize him as he admits that despite what he has achieved at 27, he still experiences loneliness, vulnerability and the lingering feeling that he isn’t good enough.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Even when Tyler was making his way into the music world, he was exploring other outlets that did not coincide with his music. He created the Adult Swim cult-classic of “Loiter Squad” that contained memorable skits parodying the Real Housewives of Atlanta, a mock PSA dubbed Lightskin Awareness, and an imitation of “Beyond Scared Straight.” Then he created the first sketches of clothing for his line Golf Wang that featured shirts with cats and upside down crosses on them. A collaboration with Vans came quickly after that, which capitalized on Tyler’s profound love for skating. Fast forward to 2018, and Tyler’s Golf Wang designs got him a 12-page spread in <em>Vogue</em>, and he created a fashion show to illustrate the designs he is comfortable with wearing. Also, this year marks the airing of his VICE show “Nuts + Bolts” that analyzes the step-by-step creations of Tyler’s favorite things, as well as his animated show “The Jellies,” which has highlighted the importance of representation of people of color in cartoons, while still carrying Tyler’s mish-mosh of Eric Andre and Kenan &amp; Kel humor. He has a Grammy-nominated album, a successful collaboration with Converse and by the way, threw the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival where attendance was near 30,000 fans.</p>\n<p>Tyler is the lovechild of the greatest creative minds, as there are parts of him that seem to channel Pharrell, Kanye West, Elon Musk, Kid Cudi and Roy Ayers Ubiquity. Although Tyler seems to be a wild amalgamation of creativity and a hyperactive personality, he is just Tyler. A dude who occasionally enjoys dressing like an Easter egg, listening to jazz, Lil Uzi shoulder-rolling to Playboi Carti’s “Half &amp; Half” and, in his free time, making groundbreaking albums that influence young kids to do the same. If you’d like to witness the creativity of Tyler in person, skate into Campbell Hall while wearing GOLF-brand overalls and matching blue one-star Converse.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/tyler-the-creator-to-discuss-work-at-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/tyler-the-creator-to-discuss-work-at-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/tyler-the-creator-to-discuss-work-at-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/tyler-the-creator-to-discuss-work-at-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/tyler-the-creator-to-discuss-work-at-campbell/","id":6650,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6649,6648,6647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez","biography":"Not available","articles":[5771,5810,5823,6266,6527,6541,6593,6628,6632,6650,6670,6677,6689,6701,6718,6742,6788,6804,6806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Modest Mouse Gets Weird at the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3687-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3687-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Their sound is a bit punk: catchy, shouty, angry, fun.

The marquee announced it in big red letters. The band, led by singer and guitarist Isaac Brock, had their heyday in the mid-2000s, but their pull was still strong enough to draw a pretty jazzed crowd that night. There are a lot of people in their thirties trying to look like people in their twenties; the phrase I’ve decided on is Uncle Hipster. This means trimmed beards and flannel for the fellas, t-shirts and jeans for the ladies. Some leather, not much. Tattoos, if extant, are concealed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the marquee, people are clumped in twos and threes, taking pictures. I head over to the merch table, intent on spending money. T-shirts and hoodies are up on the wall. The designs are pretty weird, especially the one I end up getting: a deep blue t-shirt with a buck staring out of the center, neck and body mirrored left and right. MODEST MOUSE glows in green, blue and pink lettering which, combined with the neo-’80s typeface and mirrored deer, results in a sort of confetti psychedelia. That same shirt is everywhere inside, stretched over chests and peeking under hoodies. At what frequency does a faux-pas cease to be a faux-pas? I stash my shirt under-arm and head to my seat, where I sit until the openers come on around eight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re called Mimicking Birds, a soothing, toothless indie-folk group. They play an hour of decently groovy stuff over blue and sea-green light. The singer thanks us and thanks us again for being there. Everyone claps indulgently. Mimicking Birds leave, and the shapes of the stage crew materialize on stage, testing wires and mics. The stage is dark for 20 minutes. Then the maintenance shapes leave and other, better-dressed shapes emerge, picking up guitars, twirling drumsticks. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd cheers and claps. The stage lights up. Modest Mouse opens with “Ocean Breathes Salty,” a hit from their 2004 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good News For People Who Love Bad News.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Brock’s ironic, tongue-in-cheek presence surfaces in his banter and inter-song musings. A recurring concern is the hot sauce that he swears stings his eyes. “I had a taco earlier,” he explains, “with the hot sauce, and then I rubbed my eyes.” Someone brings him a towel several songs in, and he stands on stage dabbing his eyes with it. We cheer encouragingly. He goes on to perform a spirited, idiosyncratic show, though the towel makes several more appearances before the night is out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They played a mix of earlier cuts and later hits, including “Dashboard,” “Missed the Boat,” “Fire It Up,” and “The World at Large.” A lot of Modest Mouse’s stuff is nautical-sounding (especially their 2007 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), possibly inspired by Brock’s house flooding three times in his teens. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983586179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83338\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83341\" data-attachment-id=\"83341\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/dfx_3060/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DFX_3060\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83341\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their sound is a bit punk: catchy, shouty, angry, fun. Brock’s delivery defines their sound — his voice is somewhere between a yelp and a howl, conversational one second and guttural the next. Johnny Marr brought jangly guitar arrangements to their ’04 and ’07 albums, and the effect is propulsive and buoyant. The lights that night were cool, dynamic and synchronized snugly with the rhythm. A good mix of motion, color and strobe-y effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspicuously absent, however, was the band’s 2004 mega-hit, “Float On.” If you know one song by Modest Mouse, it’s that one. Brock’s decision not to play their biggest hit was disappointing at first, but, upon further thought, made more sense than the alternative, considering his abundantly weird stage presence and, judging by his interviews, presence in general. (One album promo features a mustached Brock interrogating a neck-braced Brock, who consults the lawyer beside him when asked questions like “Who are the members of your band?”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halfway through the show, Brock asks us how we’re doing tonight. We cheer, as audiences do. Brock looks disappointed. “Now,” he says, “when I ask you how you’re doing tonight, I want you to remain totally silent. It’ll be uncomfortable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hush develops as the crowd tries to figure out why he isn’t playing “Float On.” People look around. Some clap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are you doing tonight?!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scattered, defiant cheers. Brock, unfazed, repeats his question. “How are you doing tonight?” Most obey this time, not saying anything, except for some dudes a couple rows up. In their Aviators and OCBDs, they whoop-whoop into the silence of the theater. The moment’s over. Isaac Brock says, “This is turning into a different experiment than the one I’d envisioned.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/","id":6647,"author":{"id":764,"name":"Andre Bouyssounouse"},"related":[6646,6645,6644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ariel Pink and DIIV Were Indie As Fuck at SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"His live presence was everything we could have expected and more.

Coming off of his 2017 homage </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which received widespread acclaim from critics, Ariel Pink is hitting the road in multiple countries and has brought DIIV along for some of the stops.

Their performance was tons of fun and featured a group of very likeable and talented musicians. Although it may appear easy to doubt the tangible potential for industry success in these hot local Isla Vista bands, no one can deny their talent and poise, and the opening for legend Ariel Pink is no dismissable task.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140889214\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83329\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83333\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-25/ariel-pink-and-diiv-were-indie-as-fuck-at-soho/the-real-savage-henry-soho-siavash_ghadiri-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Real Savage Henry @SOhO Siavash_Ghadiri (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DIIV was a clearly effective primer for Ariel Pink’s performance as the more mellow atmospheric sounds and elaborate light set provided a spacy backdrop for the night. I have seen DIIV play excellently before, and their SOhO set was no different. Their instrumentals nailed their usual perfect blend of clean and ambient with just the right amount of reverb and all cues were executed as cleanly as ever. A talented group that has played together for a long time, this set was clearly not their first, as hits such as “Dopamine,” “Doused” and, of course, “Under the Sun,” were executed effortlessly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After chilling out at the patio in the afterglow of DIIV, my friend and I moved up close to catch the man of the hour, the mastermind himself, Ariel Pink in all of his weird glory. After a beautiful musical blur of over an hour, I can now say in full confidence that Ariel Pink was very weird and very glorious. His presence was all that I could have imagined –– plus more that I could never have –– with beautifully strange and staggered stage presence, intense and clearly visible passion, an extremely cohesive backing band and just a shitton of high quality jams.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83331\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

ever seen, sporting a half-cut hairstyle with one side long and one side short, jean shorts that went far above his knees and a classic striped “Guess Jeans” t-shirt. With a mic full of stylistic reverb and distortion, Pink strutted and poured over his lo-fi instrumentals like no one else. His opening tunes included some standouts from his newest work, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as most of his stops on the tour has revolved around the album. Some of the earlier plays included aggressive punk era thrasher “Time to Meet Your God,” and ambient pop landscape “Bubblegum Dreams.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The later parts of his set included more selections from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as “Feels Like Heaven,” “I Wanna Be Young” and standout late night ballad “Another Weekend,” which was arguably the highlight of the night. The mellowed-out reflective change of pace gave a moment of breathing room for the audience as Pink crooned over a dreamy backdrop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The L.A. recluse also provided some deeper cuts from his repertoire as expected with someone of his lengthy and deep discography. Some other cuts included “Lipstick,” from 2014 project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pom pom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and pop ballad “Baby,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mature Themes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pink also included a number of tracks from his 2006 classic album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House Arrest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the title track as well as “Hardcore Pops are Fun,” that his backup singer pretenced with “There’s glam pop, and then there’s hardcore pop!” Such a simple yet important statement effectively summarized the cultural pull of Ariel Pink as a genre bender and musical journey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stepping off for a quick encore after an electrifying set, Ariel Pink came back out to finish with “House Arrest,” standout “Netherlands” and end with “Bobby Jameson,” B-side “Ode to the Goat,” which came as a thank you to us as an audience as well as a thank you to his inspirations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall the set was incredible with almost 20 tracks performed, all with intense personality and emotion. It seemed to fly by with quick transitions and intoxicating daze, and the man himself proved to be an absolute great and a symbol in the world of music. Ariel Pink is someone I will surely see again in the future and has opened up my eyes to the full extent and range of his work. A door was opened that gracefully pushes some more casual fans to explore just everything that this lasting artist has to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariel Pink is a mystery, an icon and indie as fuck. He has ever-expanding layers of depth and art that reach farther than most people can really know, and even knowing a little bit about him is equal to knowing nothing at all. Perhaps he is not from our time or planet, though he is equal parts future, past and present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His live presence was everything we could have expected and more. It was enigmatic, it was borderline insane and it was, for lack of a better term, Ariel Pink as fuck. Last Thursday personally marked one of the most memorable and immersive concert experiences of my entire life, as a living legend proved his extensive and everlasting prominence.</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_83330\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1275136068\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83329\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83330\" data-attachment-id=\"83330\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-25/ariel-pink-and-diiv-were-indie-as-fuck-at-soho/ariel-pink-soho-siavash_ghadiri-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ariel Pink @SOhO Siavash_Ghadiri (4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83330\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ariel-Pink-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fleetwood Mac has always been one of my favorite bands, and I would have been disappointed if they didn’t live up to the hype of the 70s, so I went in with little to no anticipation. I was lucky to find an empty seat near the front; the proximity of my seat to the stage immediately added to the intimacy and excitement of the night. Seeing Fleetwood Mac live certainly was a dream come true.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the earlier songs they played was a rendition of “Black Magic Woman” by Santana (written by Peter Green). Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks sang the song in harmony, and I was so impressed by their interpretation of it. They changed the spiteful aspect of the song to a first-person, mysterious and spell-binding narrative. Not only was the rendition absolutely breathtaking, it also still maintained the same rock-and-roll element from the original, making this cover an absolute hit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A worry I had before the night started was whether the band would have the same energy as they did in their prime. In addition to their older age, I was worried I wouldn’t feel like I was seeing Fleetwood Mac without Lindsey Buckingham being there. I was immediately proven wrong by “Black Magic Woman”— but when Stevie Nicks performed “Rhiannon,” I was indubitably sold. Nicks put on a special garb for her performance of the track and channeled a strong energy for the performance. Watching her sing “Rhiannon” was mystical; the song emulated a similar energy to the 1976 performance of it. And it wasn’t just Nicks who still possessed excitement and musical prowess — the entire band was having a blast on stage. McVie commented that she was having “so much fun” playing on stage even though the acoustics of The Forum didn’t fully amplify her sound.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had never really paid much attention to Mick Fleetwood, the drummer and co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, when listening to their music. In concert, though, it’s impossible not to — his stage energy really brought the group together. His presence even added an element of humor to the performance, as he made these incredible, hilarious faces throughout the set. If you’ve seen him live in the 70s, or watched live videos on YouTube, the faces have not changed. He packed his drum solo with intensity and energy and really riled up the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What added to the charm of the performance was how close to one another the band members appeared on stage. They weren’t just performing old songs; they were enjoying their time together on the stage and performing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> each other. Finn and Nicks interacted with charm and charisma on stage, making Finn fit in like a missing puzzle piece. It’s clear that the band has been through so much together and has nothing but appreciation for each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance moved like a story, culminating energy and ending on a positive note, “Don’t Stop,” for their encore. I danced along to so many of their songs and truly felt blessed to be there. The fact that the venue was completely seated didn’t stop almost everybody from standing and dancing throughout. The band officially closed their performance with Nicks and McVie performing a relatively obscure song, “All Over Again,” from their 1995 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TIME</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at the end of which they shared a hug.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mick ended the concert with a simple message of kindness and compassion, telling the audience to take care of themselves and be kind to one another. It’s incredible when a band that can play so well and perform with such intensity still takes a step back to promote positivity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole show was not only beautiful but also wondrous and dreamlike — from the moment the whole band started to the end, there was not one moment of lull. Some of their songs have such powerful lyrics, but seeing them live gave a whole new dynamism to the music. The ethereal and magical energy that the band emitted throughout the concert stuck with me for the whole night. I gained a newfound appreciation for Fleetwood Mac and would certainly see them again if given the opportunity.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.
