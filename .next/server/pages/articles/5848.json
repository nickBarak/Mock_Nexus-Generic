Kennedy’s assassination in 1963.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the swirling buzz around Election Day, last Wednesday night seemed an appropriate time for UCSB’s Pollock Theatre’s screening of the HBO film “All The Way,” a biopic of Lyndon B. Johnson’s tumultuous 1964 campaign for presidency. The event also featured a Q&amp;A with the film’s director, Jay Roach, (of “Meet the Parents” and “Austin Powers” fame) which treated students and moviegoers to a night of lively discussion about the film and its portrayal of the complex presidential candidate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson became president in the worst way he could have imagined — in the wake of John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. A Texan Democrat brought to power by the support of Southern Democrats, Johnson faced enormous political pressure from a party divided between conservative “Dixiecrats” and Northern liberals. Caught between loyalty to his fellow Southerners and the moral imperative of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Johnson was forced to make tough decisions concerning Civil Rights. “I will drag the South out of the past kicking and screaming if I have to,” Johnson, played by Brian Cranston, says, decisively staking his presidency on the controversial Civil Rights Act. The film focuses on the generational divide between young radicals and older conservatives, portraying Johnson as moderate, yet innovative. “The South won’t like it, but this is how new things are born,” he argues. This innovation becomes the driving force of his campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film depicts several important events of the Civil Rights Movements that occurred during Johnson’s campaign, such as the murder of three Mississippi Freedom Summer Project volunteers, who went missing after registering blacks in Mississippi to vote, and the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, during which Mississippi’s all-white delegates walked out to protest the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party’s attendance. Johnson’s frustration with the South is a source of constant anxiety, but director Jay Roach portrays him as a man who sticks to his guns. “I believe in the power of the government to do good,” Roach explained during the Q&amp;A after the film. “I really wanted to emphasize that Johnson tried to do the right thing.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were more than a few nuances to Cranston’s character. Roach portrayed Johnson as a bully to his wife and to numerous people who crossed him. He is also depicted several times in moments of deep self-pity, moaning from his bed that “everyone is against [him].” However, every moment of weakness is contrasted by a moment of power — Johnson declaring that “politics is war” and telling senators that he “will crush them” if they stand in his way of passing the Civil Rights Act, to name a few. The film’s nuanced portrayal of Johnson called to mind today’s presidential candidates and asked the viewer what kind of qualities they want to see in a president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ryan, director of Pollock Theatre, commented that the movie seems to be relevant to the current election season, noting that voter intimidation in the film is much like the voter intimidation on the news today. From the recent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vandalization</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a church in Mississippi, which was spray-painted with the tag “Vote Trump,” to Trump’s support of restrictive voter ID laws, the 1964 campaign is more relevant than ever. In one of the film’s most powerful scenes, Johnson asks a Georgia senator threatening to walk out of the Democratic National Convention “what side of history he wants to be on.” Present day voters might ask themselves the same question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All The Way” could also inspire students and members of the community to vote and appreciate the effectiveness of grassroots campaigning. The political pressure groups such as SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) put on Johnson made a difference in his decision-making. Dr. King, played by Anthony Mackie, tells SNCC in the film that “Johnson isn’t going to give anything to us. We have to take it.” The movie demonstrates that voting is not a right to take for granted, and the effectiveness of grassroots campaigning is motivation to participate in the election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening ended with a small reception with food in the lobby. Movie goers were left with lots to think about. Perhaps the most striking realization about Johnson is that he was able to shed the legacy of the “accidental” president following Kennedy’s assassination. His campaign proved that he was capable of leading a divided Democratic party and earning the nomination in his own right.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/all-the-way-captures-election-anxiety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/all-the-way-captures-election-anxiety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/all-the-way-captures-election-anxiety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/all-the-way-captures-election-anxiety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/all-the-way-captures-election-anxiety/","id":5848,"author":{"id":774,"name":"Molly Guillermo"},"related":[5847,5846,5845],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":774,"name":"Molly Guillermo","biography":"Not available","articles":[5848],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Not Beyond Expectations, but Still a Good ol’ Trek","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?resize=800%2C527&ssl=1","description":"A better title would have been \"Star Trek: Evolution.\" That said, perhaps it is warranted since the film seems to really be all about going beyond one's nature.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72149\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"894613608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72148\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72149\" data-attachment-id=\"72149\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/not-beyond-expectations-but-still-a-good-ol-trek/beyond-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?fit=800%2C527&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,527\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"beyond-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?fit=888%2C584&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72149\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/beyond-01-e1471232800427.png?resize=800%2C527\" alt=\"Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"527\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Star Trek Beyond” is a bit of misnomer. The Enterprise crew never really goes “beyond” anything, neither in the galactic nor the as-characters sense. A better title would have been “Star Trek: Evolution.” That said, perhaps it is warranted since the film seems to really be all about going beyond one’s nature.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme in the film, after all, is transformation. Kirk and Spock have both become contemplative about what their futures hold for them and find themselves at a crossroads: Will they remain with their friends and keep Trekkin’ on the Enterprise’s dull five-year mission, or will they choose a higher purpose that will allow them to make change? This is the great quandary the two must consider, as, wouldn’t ya know it, the Enterprise gets the living shit kicked out of it by a superior force.</p>\n<p>And who is behind this shit-kicking? The ridge-headed alien Krall (played by Idris Elba, whose baritone gives Morgan Freeman’s distinctive voice a run for its money). Unlike Shere Khan from “The Jungle Book,” however, Elba’s “Trek” villain is barely threatening or compelling. Just like Khan (the <em>other </em>Khan), he’s mighty pissed at Starfleet and wants to destroy them. This time, however, he has a MacGuffin key to a superweapon, which is just like most other superweapons you’ve seen. Krall, you’re lucky your makeup looks awesome; otherwise you’d be pretty boring.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Good thing the villain isn’t really the focus. Most of the time, we follow the divided members of the Enterprise crew on a Class M planet (basically, another Earth) as they try to figure out how to solve their predicament. Well, mostly: Uhura settles on psychoanalyzing Krall for some reason.</p>\n<p>On the more exciting end of things, Kirk and Chekov struggle to survive against alien onslaughts and dim lighting. Meanwhile, Scotty meets one of the first fresh and fun characters in the Star Trek franchise for a while: Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella, who this writer predicts could snag a role in “The Expendabelles” (whenever the damn thing comes out, that is). Boutella is no stranger to bad-ass roles (see “Kingsman: The Secret Service”), and here she gets more ass-kicking in than any other character, what with her superb hand-to-hand combat and some staff-wielding skills that would make Rey jealous.</p>\n<p>Speaking of action, what differentiates the action of “Beyond” from its predecessors is its use of anachronisms within the plot: Kirk using a motorcycle to evade aliens and blasting spaceships to the tune of The Beastie Boys (McCoy humorously refers to “Sabotage” as classical) is something that “Enterprise” fans will wholly appreciate. Essentially, Star Trek’s sci-fi roots have been boiled down somewhat for the sake of the fight scenes, which is a good thing in this case. There’s only so many times you can watch a pair of spaceships casually float by while shooting lasers at each other.</p>\n<p>Apparently, one of the big criticisms of the prior “Kelvin timeline” Star Trek films is their lack of life lessons. You certainly get some here, courtesy of Kirk. In the time he espouses said lessons, however, he could easily be taking Krall down and preventing his generic master plan from succeeding. I don’t quite remember where I heard this, but I think it’s an appropriate adage for such a scene: “You can suspend disbelief, but not common sense.” In this case, common sense is shooting a genocidal alien before he can commit mass genocide.</p>\n<p>Finally, I feel it’s appropriate to address the two big losses to the Trek world: Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin. The movie is dedicated to the memory of both. Considering the timing of their deaths, only Nimoy’s really affected the plot, and in a touching way that feeds into Quinto-Spock’s character arc. Since this is Yelchin’s last time on the final frontier, it’s good to see that he gets a fairly prominent role in the plot, a final hurrah for a talented man gone too soon.</p><div

palpable as the intrepid first guests trickled into the spaciously small UCSB Art, Design, &amp; Architecture Museum, accosted by the grotesque and jagged faces of monsters from beyond the stars. Alien faces leered with eyeless sockets as patrons braved this bold new world, a chaotic and perhaps nightmarish universe conceived in the mind of an otherwise affable and unassuming genius.</p>\n<p>The architect of this madness is Michael Westmore, who stood, benevolently mild, to the left of the entrance in a corner surrounded by the cybernetic arms and blinking eyes of the hellish Borg. Walking among the gnarled faces of Cardassian soldiers and Klingon warriors, coexisting in lifeless harmony, an appreciation for the spatial complexity of the sculpting involved in the creation process dawns on the viewer.</p>\n<p>Foam latex molds and sketches of alien facial features adorned the walls of the exhibit. Full head casts of Sir Patrick Stewart, who played the levelheaded Captain Jean-Luc Picard in “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” rested beside a display detailing the drawing-board evolution of an alien nose.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Getting to “[see] how this stuff is made” became a near-overwhelming experience.</p>\n<p>Local Trekkie commitment was literally visible in the quantity of “Star Trek” themed apparel strolling through the exhibit, including a fully dressed Uhura. The line to speak with Westmore became saturated by avid fans yearning to convey their love of the show and its role in their development. Countless pictures were snapped with the man responsible for the foodstuffs of so many of their young imaginations.</p>\n<p>But the generational gap presented no problem, as young fans of both “Star Trek” and Westmore’s successful game show “Faceoff” also waited to converse with the familiar artist. A gaggle of freshmen with nominal connection to either “Star Trek” or Westmore’s other extensive works were giddy with admiration at meeting the man behind their favorite show, something that to them has become “a family experience.” Westmore released some good news: fans have another three seasons of “Faceoff” to which they can look forward.</p>\n<p>While Westmore’s legacy spans over 80 movies and television shows, encompassing the likes of “Rocky,” the “Munsters” and “Raging Bull,” his family’s work in the Hollywood makeup industry offers some of the most prolific contributions to the history of Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Beginning with Westmore’s grandfather George Westmore, who founded the first movie makeup studio in Hollywood, the Westmore family has been involved with movies as influential as “Gone With the Wind” and created creatures as notorious as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Creature From the Black Lagoon. The Westmore name is so ingrained into Hollywood that stars such as Elizabeth Taylor coddled Mr. Westmore as a child, while Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro became family friends.</p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus, Westmore began his studies as a fine arts major, hoping to diverge from the movie-making sculpting that surrounded his childhood by becoming an educator. With heavy training in the arts, Westmore soon decided to pursue what he found to be his passion, art history, with the hopes of museum curation, archaeology or professorship.</p>\n<p>Invariably, he ended back in Hollywood for a movie production internship with his uncle, Bud Westmore. Finding a mentor in John Chambers, another of the most influential makeup artists in movie history, Mr. Westmore held fast to the profession of his forefathers, even becoming involved with the CIA in a project involving fake identities and disguises.</p>\n<p>The evening continued as the UCSB Pollock Theater presented a 20th anniversary screening of one of Westmore’s more famous Star Trek movies, “Star Trek: First Contact.” While the theater was not packed, a vibrant population of Trekkies arrived to show their support.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73120\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1840219882\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73156\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73120\" data-attachment-id=\"73120\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73120\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"William Emmons / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73120\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With a few opening words from Westmore and Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan, the audience delved straight into the heat of a zero-g spaceship battle above Earth’s atmosphere. Enthralled in the voyage of the Enterprise E and her crew, UCSB students and locals alike were shown the complexity and otherworldly craftsmanship of the Westmores’ makeup work in creating both the cybernetic Borg menace and the Federation allies (the likes of Data the android and Warf the Klingon).</p>\n<p>As the credits rolled, a healthy ovation surrounded the appearance of Michael Westmore’s name.</p>\n<p>A small Q &amp; A session led by Ryan followed the film. Questions focused primarily on “First Contact” and Westmore’s more famous works, including his interactions with stars like DeNiro and Bette Davis. Though much was said of the business aspect of the art of movie makeup, Westmore did offer advice to aspiring artists, drawn from his personal experience as well as his role as a guide for artists navigating the modern industry on his show, “Faceoff.” “[In today’s world] you have to go to school, in order to be competitive and to know what you’re doing. The training offered in school is highly recommended.”</p>\n<p>Westmore touched on his training, which involved classical makeup (i.e. beauty work) and an emphasis in sculpting.</p>\n<p>Westmore’s exhibit, Lifeforms, is open until Dec. 4. The exhibit will reopen after a winter hiatus until April of 2017.

Dory, the amnesiac regal blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres (aka mediocre Oscar host number 39) suddenly recalls her childhood memories. Knowing she has to head to California, she sets her sights for Morro Bay and goes on a journey, with Nemo and his father, Marlin, following right behind. With almost the entire cast and crew of the original back for a second outing, it looks likely that Pixar will craft another great sequel. (Cars 2? Didn’t happen).</p>\n<p><em>In theaters now.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Independence Day: Resurgence</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it be New York, the planet itself or the Godzilla franchise, Roland Emmerich is the king of fucking shit up. And now, his first sequel is invading cinemas.</p>\n<p>Taking place after the original big-budget B-movie, “Resurgence” sees humanity, armed with enhanced alien weaponry hacked from the last one, going on the defense once again as they return to destroy our famous landmarks. But with the help of Will Smi…wait, what? He’s not in this one? Then who did they get? Liam Hemsworth? Oh. Eh.</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, expect to turn off your brain when this comes around. You like seeing shit blowing up? Surprise, you’re gonna see shit blow up.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters tomorrow, June 24.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Star Trek Beyond</strong></p>\n<p>Good luck seeing this, unless the lens flares of the last two have blinded you already.</p>\n<p>After the Enterprise gets its ass handed to it for the umpteenth time, Captain Kirk and co. are forced to evacuate to an unfamiliar planet where a big, bad alien played by the golden-voiced Idris Elba appears to give them grief. As to be expected in a Trek film, there are badass aliens, a lotta lasers shooting all over the place and some banter thrown in for good measure.</p>\n<p>With Justin Lin in the director’s chair instead of J.J. Abrams, it remains to be seen if he can keep up the storytelling energy of the last two. At the very least, Lin can drink the tears of all the Trekkies clamoring for less action and more politics. Sorry guys; it ain’t happening.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters July 22.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The BFG</strong></p>\n<p>Are you feeling the ‘Berg? Yeah, that’s all I got.</p>\n<p>The newest entry in Steven Spielberg’s long filmography, “BFG” is an adaptation of the classic children’s novel written by Road Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film involves a little girl named Sophie encountering a gigantic man (Mark Rylance) whom she calls BFG, or Big Friendly Giant.</p>\n<p>After “Bridge of Spies,” it should be fun to see Spielberg regress back into more sentimental fare. And having never read the book, I am personally looking forward to watching this adaptation. Plus, hearing another John Williams score never hurts.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters July 1.</em><br>\n<strong>Suicide Squad</strong></p>\n<p>If anything, this movie will either be the Lazarus pit or the crowbar to the head for the DC movie universe. Props if you get the references.</p>\n<p>Bringing together a huge ensemble cast, “Suicide Squad” follows a squad of super-baddies who have been recruited by government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). Their mission: Go kill other bad guys.</p>\n<p>The biggest draw of this film is, of course, finally getting to see the likes of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Waller, etc. on the big screen, as well as Jared Leto’s take on the Joker. Thus far, the film’s marketing has been killer, showcasing the quirky charms of the squad, using some pretty fun music and keeping plot details under some impressively taut wraps.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Aug. 5.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Snowden</strong></p>\n<p>Well, this isn’t exactly high-octane popcorn fare or the like, but it ought to be fascinating.</p>\n<p>Now that I have turned you off the film, let’s get down to the details. If the title didn’t tip you off already, “Snowden” is an account of the life of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). After getting a job at the NSA, he realizes the extent of its surveillance powers, and decides to take action.</p>\n<p>Even though all of us AP Gov. survivors know how this ends, the experience should hopefully be worth it; director Oliver Stone is most famous for his political thrillers, and Gordon-Levitt has Snowden’s appearance and voice down to a tee.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Sept. 16.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</strong></p>\n<p>I started off writing about “The Magnificent Seven,” a remake of a remake. Then I saw three seconds of footage from this movie and changed my mind.</p>\n<p>Essentially X-Men with a healthy dose of Tim Burton, “Miss Peregrine’s” is about Jacob, a boy who arrives at an orphanage run by the titular Miss Peregrine (played by ex-Bond girl Eva Green). At this orphanage, every child has a particular, peculiar trait, like a little girl with a mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth in the back of her head.</p>\n<p>Burton is the master of the weird, although his adaptations have been wavering in quality in recent years. Will this redeem him for “Alice in Wonderland?” Perhaps if we say the title three times, it will make it so.</p>\n<p><em>In theaters Sept. 30.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/artsweek-summer-movie-preview/","id":5847,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5846,5845,5844],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
