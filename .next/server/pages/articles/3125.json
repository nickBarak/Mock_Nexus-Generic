Similar campaign...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Environmental Affairs Board is currently lobbying the Associate Students Senate to endorse a campaign requesting that the campus make divestments from fossil fuel-based companies.</p>\n<p>Similar campaigns have been organized across the UC system, with numerous university campuses taking a stand against corporations centered around fossil fuels. Ultimately, the students and other supporters involved in these efforts hope to gain the approval of the UC Board of Regents in endorsing a system-wide movement.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year environmental studies major Emily Williams, who is campus coordinator of statewide affairs for EAB, said the group first introduced the proposal at last Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting. However, due to opposition from many A.S. members, the resolution was postponed until a later meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams said she hopes to gain student support in lobbying for the movement, allowing UCSB to join almost 200 universities and colleges across the U.S.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing else in the policy that says how we should invest our money other than to maximize the profit and minimize the risk, and to me that seems wrong,” Williams said. “If we claim to be sustainability-focused and if we claim to be progressive, how can we be invested in an industry making profit off the suffering of others and the degradation of our environment?”</p>\n<p>UC campuses divested from Sudan during the genocide as well as from South Africa during apartheid, so it would seem appropriate to essentially boycott fossil fuel-based companies, which inflict on public health and the environment, according to Williams, who added that fossil fuel divestments particularly affect people in communities near natural gas or coal processing plants.</p>\n<p>In regards to last week’s Senate meeting, UCSB sociology professor and co-director of the International Institute of Climate Action and Theory John Foran said the petition aims to address a multifaceted issue with far-reaching effects that are not apparent at first glance.</p>\n<p>“This is an education process,” Foran said. “It’s not an easy issue to get your head around — it’s something that’s very huge. It’s in many ways invisible, and in many ways it’s coming at us from the future.”</p>\n<p>Foran also said the marginal financial effect posed by divestment pales in comparison to the looming catastrophe that could result from fossil fuel-induced climate change.</p>\n<p>“There is a limit of carbon dioxide we can afford to put into the atmosphere,” Foran said. “The existing proven [carbon dioxide] reserves of the fossil fuel industry are five times the amount that will push us over the limit.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the campaign could take time to catch on due to the technical complexity of the proposal, which includes terms such as “endowments” and “marginalized risks.” Despite this, Williams said he hopes that even schools that have partially divested from fossil fuels should be praised for sparking the conversation about the movement on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think once people get to know, ‘Okay, we’re just talking about investments in an industry,’ people get very passionate about it,” Williams said. “I can see the campus getting really riled up — students, faculty and staff — I see them talking together … Let’s work with the Regents.”</p>\n<p>Foran said many adversaries of environmental reform lack credibility because they skew information to fit their own agenda.</p>\n<p>“There are going to be people trying to scare others, and that’s really the only argument they have,” Foran said. “We know that the fossil fuels industry has a well-documented record of countering any criticism, and they’ll do that by any means necessary … to distort facts and to lie outright.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, the UC is not deliberately invested in the fossil fuels industry and thus, its progressive image will not be marred with divestment. In reference to an article by Chief Investing Officer Patrick Geddes of the Californian money management firm Aperio Group including a study indicating a negligible effect on UC revenue in the case of fossil fuel divestment, Foran said pointing out environmental issues without action would be “hypocritical.”</p>\n<p>“In some of the studies I’ve seen — and I’m sure we’ll see more studies — [fossil fuel divestment] makes very little impact on the portfolio,” Foran said. “It doesn’t harm the holdings of the university and it doesn’t therefore go against any responsibilities of the investment people to maximize income — I’m talking percentages of a percent.”</p>\n<p>According to UCSB philosophy graduate student and environmental studies teaching assistant Quentin Gee, the UC system as a whole has slipped from its place at the leading edge of responsible investing.</p>\n<p>“Universities have actually gone from being the leaders of responsible investing to sort of following on the coattails of other foundations,” Gee said. “We just want the investment group that the Regents oversee to think creatively.”</p>\n<p>Gee also said several smaller colleges have managed to divest and even larger institutions such as Harvard University have been active about putting the issue on the table.</p>\n<p>“Even though you can make money off of something that is fundamentally unsustainable and detrimental to our health, population and environment … doesn’t mean you should,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>EAB’s fossil fuel focus group plans to host a teach-in to further inform students about the divestment campaign sometime in the upcoming month.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50150\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50150\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/eab-petitions-a-s-to-divest-fossil-fuel-holdings/","id":3122,"author":{"id":204,"name":"Adam Courtin"},"related":[3121,3120,3119],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Representatives</strong></p>\n<p>Six unelected representatives were sworn in to the 2011-2012 Associated Students Legislative Council at last night’s meeting to replace four newly elected representatives involved in an ongoing judicial council case in addition to two representative-elects who have officially resigned.</p>\n<p>After pleading no contest to charges of grand theft, unauthorized alteration of a computer data system, felony burglary and receiving stolen property at his preliminary hearing yesterday, Representative-at-Large-elect Joe Lee formally stepped down from his position, citing “idiotic political pressure … roaming around A.S.” Lee, who was replaced by Democratic Process Party representative-at-large Sophia Armen, went on to accuse an unnamed fellow council member of extortion during the meeting’s public forum. Lee is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing on June 22.</p>\n<p>In addition, Open People’s Party On-Campus Representative-elect Pancho Occiano chose to defer his position on next year’s council to D.P.P. On-Campus Representative Christian Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Four elected O.P.P. members — Representatives-at-Large Kelly Gandee and Chelsea Parrott and Off-Campus Representatives Lauren Begleiter and Alexa Cover — were charged with supplying alcohol to minors during Spring Elections by A.S. Elections Committee on May 6 and face either disqualification or forced resignation pending Judicial Council’s approval of the case. The four were replaced by D.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Xenia Mendez and Marlene Moreno and D.P.P. Representatives-at-Large Danielle Stevens and Danielle Bermudez.</p>\n<p>Four additional council members — O.P.P. Off-Campus Representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and O.P.P. Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter — were charged with the same infraction but given the option to either resign or serve their terms without receiving honoraria. All four were sworn in last night and plan to remain on the council. Former Legislative Council members Yeni Nguyen and Kellie Hartl were also implicated in the case but may not fall under the purview of Elections Committee as they are no longer student government representatives. O.P.P. Executive Board members President Harrison Weber, Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker, External Vice President of Local Affairs Tim Benson and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Ahmed Mostafa were also charged and given the option to either resign or serve as planned and complete 45 hours of A.S.-related community service each during the 2011-2012 academic year. All four plan to remain in their newly appointed positions.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is slated to inform the individuals today of its decision to either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or hear an appeal drafted by the Executive board members on behalf of all 14 implicated students.</p>\n<p>According to Benson, Elections Committee — which holds closed meetings only — reached their decision in a manner not consistent with A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely taking [the case] to Judicial Council because we feel that, based on the Legal Code and based on the rules that are in place for the elections committee, they followed them improperly and we were unjustly given pretty harsh punishments,” Benson said. “They never gave me any due process in any of this. I felt that it wasn’t really fair that I was given no chance to explain myself, no chance to explain any of my involvement in what was going on and I was given quite a hefty slap on the wrist.”</p>\n<p>Visit dailynexus.com for online updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Business</strong></p>\n<p>In their final meeting, the 2010-2011 council approved a reallocation of $700 for a planned UC Haiti Initiative and set aside $55,000 — comprised of funding from the budgets of various BCCs — to fund the A.S. Annex, an Isla Vista community center that provide offices for A.S. entities, in the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Representative Joe Lewis said while he supported the allocation, he is concerned the center’s location is not accessible to students in the community.</p>\n<p>“I think this is a great bill but I drove by and checked out the building, and it seems a bit hidden,” Lewis said. “I’d eventually like to have a sign or notice on that street to attract some attention since I don’t think it’ll get a lot of foot traffic on its own.”</p>\n<p>Former Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said the resolution provides that there will be such signs in the surrounding area of the center.</p>\n<p>The council reallocated $200 instead of an originally requested $467 for Black Graduation to print graduation programs. Lewis said the funding did not seem necessary as it would benefit only a select number of students.</p>\n<p>“I just don’t feel it represents the entire student body as student funds should,” Lewis said. “I feel it’s exclusive to the rest of the student body.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville authored a Green Bill mandating sustainable practices within A.S. buildings, including recycling, composting, avoiding paper and using green cleaning products. The bill was amended to include a mandate that A.S. funds given for group events or meetings may only purchase food that is at least 50 percent sustainable.</p>\n<p>While Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez said the request would be unrealistic for student groups and drive up event costs, Mayville said the bill is intended to set a precedent for the rest of the student body.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize it is expensive, but I think a little less food or more costly food is worth it because it is socially and environmentally responsible, and A.S. needs to set an example,” Mayville said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker said the bill’s specificity would make it difficult to enforce.</p>\n<p>“Coming from a Finance board perspective, another really tough thing will be how to let groups know about all this,” Stryker said. “It’s going to be hard for groups to follow all of this. Make it more broad so student groups can feasibly follow and understand it.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the council has the duty to implement progressive policies and student groups have been asked to follow similar rules in the past.</p>\n<p>“[Office of Student Life] groups learn so quickly about what our funding policies are,” Tzankov said. “I think it’s important that we do set the precedent and we don’t put this off, but approve it as it is.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually passed the bill with an amendment making it applicable to only A.S. entities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council deliberated over a bill to increase transparency within the group by posting audio recordings of its weekly meetings on the association’s website. However, the bill failed to pass due to expensive software and microphone costs. Tsankov said he recommended that the newly appointed council continue discussion on the measure.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39346\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39346\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/swears-representatives/","id":3123,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3122,3121,3120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
