Showing the best of the best cinematography of the Banff Film Festival that takes place in Canada every year, the Banff Film Festival World Tour made a stop at the Arlington Theater downtown Tuesday and Wednesday, February 23 and 24. This epic event was hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures for the 25th year in a row, and showed 17 short films and film excerpts demonstrating intense outdoor adventures.</p>\n<p>Two thousand people, notably decked in Patagonia, The North Face, various flannels and puff jackets, snaked around the Arlington waiting to take their seats. This crowd was stoked to say the least. Families, large groups, small groups, teenagers and everyone in between all shared the same sense of adventure, which connected all 2,000 of us together.</p>\n<p>Most of these people were Banff veterans anxiously awaiting more adventure in their lives. While waiting in line, I spoke to a man dressed in sandals and a blue Hawaiian button-up shirt who said that he’s attended the tour every year that it has stopped in Santa Barbara. “It’s always entertaining,” he said, “I like the mountain culture aspect of it.” He recounted films that were shown years ago, that kept him on the edge of his seat then, and clearly left a huge impact on him, as he remembered the audience’s reactions and how the footage made him feel. When I asked about how the films have changed over time, he stated that instead of seeing “a Miller ski scene,” as he described it, we now see more complex but still exciting cinema.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>All 2,000 local community members and students alike were exceptionally eager to get inside, and finally the line started moving. We inched below the red marquee and into the foyer. There, UCSB Adventure Programs, a sponsor of the event, was tabling and giving out the recycled pens and the orange-yellow ombré stickers that we students know so well. We filed in to take our seats, chatter filled the auditorium, the lights dimmed and it was showtime. A reel of the event’s sponsors played and when the advertisement for Deuter backpacks was presented, the audience simultaneously yelled a German phrase like it had been rehearsed before the show. I still don’t quite know what it meant or where it came from, but it really showed how connected, involved and allegiant the audience of this film tour was.</p>\n<p>An introductory video of the tour played, and with every breathtaking image or death-defying stunt that played on screen, you could hear gasps coming from every corner of the building. Literally the only word going through my mind was “woah.” It was only five minutes into this thing and I was already speechless. I suddenly knew why all these people continue to come back year after year.</p>\n<p>We were eventually greeted by Shauna Strain, who works for the festival, who introduced us to all the films throughout the evening. Out of the 65 movies made and shown in the festival in Banff, 17 of the best competitors were able to go on tour.</p>\n<p>The first film of the night was a short special edit of “Paradise Waits,” a film made about free skiing and big mountain skiing. The piercing imagery of this piece, the upbeat music and the humor really set up the night and got everyone settled in for an awesome time.</p>\n<p>Cinematic masterpiece after masterpiece played, each being just as, if not more, stunning as the last. These films captured the spirit of mountain culture and raw adventure. Crystal-clear imagery never left the screen and constantly captivated the audience. The vivid colors of our natural world saturated the eyes of everyone there. Mixtures of blues from either the sky or ice, and deep greens from the trees or the salamanders from “The Last Dragons,” a film covering conservation efforts happening on the East Coast, filled the room. Depicting scenes of rock climbers defying the odds, ice climbers challenging themselves in new ways, paragliders breaking new records or tour guides in China introducing local children to the wonders of nature, these films provided something for everyone. These stunts were unbelievable, and had the crowd at the edge of their seats. There were even a few, “Oh shits!” interjected throughout the evening from the gentleman sitting to my right. Yet, if I had to pick a favorite, the special edit of unReal” was by far the most exciting film to watch. Telling the story of a group of mountain bikers, this slow-mo, yet action-packed movie gave me a whole new respect for mountain biking, and was filmed right here in California. The good news is that you can find all of these films online on the Banff Film Festival website.</p>\n<p>But alongside these astonishing images of the planet was always a lesson to be learned. Many of the movies focused on the ways that we can help conserve and preserve the natural beauty of this world. These stories shared eye-opening facts about environmental degradation happening all around us, and the scary, yet true, repercussions we may face if we continue to live our lives this way. These films showed us the magnificence and power of our planet and all of the precious gifts it has to offer us, because without the wilderness we would not be able to partake in any of these outdoor sports or excursions.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Roman Baratiak, the associate director of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, who had been putting on this event for each of the 25 years it has been in Santa Barbara. He said that the main goals of this film festival were to share a love and appreciation for nature, a sense of environmental consciousness and of course, having fun. These goals were most definitely achieved, as everyone left the theater ready to learn more about people and the planet, and start new adventures of our own.</p>\n<p>We should all try to connect more with the planet, whether it’s paragliding through the Canadian Rockies or hiking to Inspiration Point. So get outside, grab some grub, pack up the Subi and go shred some gnar.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/banff-film-fest-hits-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/banff-film-fest-hits-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/banff-film-fest-hits-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/banff-film-fest-hits-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/banff-film-fest-hits-santa-barbara/","id":5869,"author":{"id":777,"name":"Kaitlyn Haberlin"},"related":[5868,5867,5866],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":777,"name":"Kaitlyn Haberlin","biography":"Not available","articles":[5869],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Artsweek Reviews Deadpool","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ty0neic0o4jqee5oms8e-e1456371428887.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ty0neic0o4jqee5oms8e-e1456371428887.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1","description":"“Everyone, please turn around and welcome Ryan Reynolds!” A resounding crack echoes inside I.V.

Hey, they may have slaughtered the Fantastic Four, but at least they know how to market their shit.</p>\n<p>Then the screen goes dark and the comic book nerds shush their talkative neighbors. The film begins. “Angel of the Morning” plays and the film immediately lets us know what we’re in for as credits like “Starring God’s Gift to Man” and “Directed by Some Overpaid Tool” appear.</p>\n<p>Yup, “Deadpool” has arrived, a year and a half after I watched the leaked concept video during orientation. In its journey from CGI “what if” to Ryan Reynold’s flesh-and-blood crotch taking up most of the screen, the titular antihero has not lost an inch of his psychopathic charm.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is what anchors the film. Deadpool himself is impossibly hilarious. Nobody is safe from his sarcastic observations and scathing references. “Oh, your poor wife,” he moans after he punches the chrome colossus that is, well, Colossus in the balls. Ryan Reynolds has pitch-perfect delivery, although his performance is not all shits and giggles. There’s still enough emotional weight to his character that gives him motivation and humanity behind the burned casserole that is his face.</p>\n<p>That’s more I can say for the villain. Ajax (or Francis, as Deadpool vehemently insists on calling him) is about as interesting and amusing as a boiling pot of water. His only purpose is to provide Deadpool more material to work with. It’s a little disappointing that the film’s villain has absolutely no motivation, no good lines and, contrary to my friend’s insistence, has the sex appeal of roadkill. (Then again, aren’t all Marvel villains barring Loki like that?) It was a lot more gratifying to see Deadpool annihilate Rob Liefeld than watch these two mutants violently cross blades.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, you may be wondering: does “Deadpool” live up to its R-rating? Believe it or not, Marvel’s Netflix series actually seems gorier in comparison. That’s because whereas “Daredevil” treats its violence very seriously, “Deadpool” turns a man cutting off his own hand into a gag. But fear not, for there is definitely enough decapitations and blood to go around.</p>\n<p>As for the graphic nudity front, I can say that both boys and girls will probably come away turned on, but the women may have to look a little harder. Whereas the boobs are all well-lit thanks to the neon-pink strip club lighting, Deadpool’s wang is obscured in shadow. And, just saying, I only looked out for his dong for the sake of this review. I swear. Really. You should be thanking me.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful (yeah, lame transition, I know) that “Deadpool” is a riot. The jokes keep coming like a gift that keeps on giving. There’s such a wide variety of humor on display: satires of superhero movie tropes, parodies of John Hughes movies, Fawlty Towers references(!), incredibly violent slapstick and of course, a lot of penis humor.</p>\n<p>The movie’s humor, however, is not groundbreaking by any means. It still adheres to that annoying cliché of stopping the action and cutting out the music, which is basically the overpaid tool’s way of saying, “Laugh, goddammit, laugh.”</p>\n<p>Contrary to the marketing, the film is not a straight laugh train. Half of the time, both the movie and Deadpool himself steer into typical superhero melodrama. For what’s here, it works, but there’s not quite enough substance for my pretentious tastes. Deadpool has motivation, sure, but the villains don’t. The villains are there to look mean and act likewise. It’s a movie of halves.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean half the movie sucks; it’s undeniably entertaining. Deadpool is not the messiah of superhero comedy; it’s flawed, but it definitely takes advantage of its hard R to the best possible extent. The badass Merc with a Mouth is unashamedly immature and is all the more awesome for it. I definitely don’t regret waiting for an hour and a half for my ticket. Go see “Deadpool” and make it rain for 20th Century Fox.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

beginning to worry that Johnny Depp might not show up to collect his Maltin Modern Master award from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. A no-show would have been uncharacteristic of someone who Scott Cooper, the director of Depp’s latest film “Black Mass,” described as “one of the kindest, most soulful, most generous men that [he knows],” and true to form, Depp eventually arrived. Depp was rushed past reporters and into the Arlington Theatre by his handlers, although he made an attempt to answer a few questions along the way.</p>\n<p>This effort on his part was surprising since, as Leonard Maltin, the film critic for whom the award is now named, pointed out at the start of the evening, Depp is notorious for avoiding press. “People have said in the past week or so: ‘Johnny Depp doesn’t do things like this,’ which he doesn’t,” Maltin said, although even without this observation, it would have been obvious to most people in the audience. Depp was visibly nervous and fidgeted throughout the evening with his rings, hair, sunglasses and, most notably, his black and white HUF Plantlife socks. For much of the first portion of the interview, he stared down at his hands, peering sideways at Maltin or up at the audience to see if one of his numerous jokes got the right reaction.</p>\n<p>For the most part they did, although some of his more bizarre jokes were lost on Maltin, and this seemed to boost his confidence. By the time Maltin and Depp were halfway through their hour-and-a-half long interview, Depp’s body language had opened up. He was looking at and interacting with the audience more, affectionately imitating former co-stars and, on two occasions, gesturing so enthusiastically that he knocked his own microphone. Depp even joked, un-annoyed, with the one bizarre heckler of the evening, who told the actor to “grow more things.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I grow things,” Depp said, adding, “Might not be the same things that you’re growing,” although his socks implied otherwise.</p>\n<p>This was in contrast to Maltin, who stayed in almost the same rapt position throughout the interview and seemed a bit awestruck by Depp. He didn’t interject often, content to listen to Depp’s rambling, often inconclusive but entertaining stories and, when he did interrupt, it was to introduce one of the many movie clips that interspersed their conversation or to prod Depp for the end of a sentence. It’s possible that Depp could have used a bit more prodding, however, since the event went on so long that some people started leaving and at least one woman fell asleep in her seat. This could also have had something to do with the sheer number of movies Depp has in his repertoire — over 40 at this point — and Maltin even apologised at the start they could not show clips from all of his works.</p>\n<p>Clearly Depp shared the opinion that the interview went on too long, though, since he started rolling a cigarette about forty minutes in and had it in his hand until the end. He may have lost his initial shyness and expressed sincere gratitude that he was “lucky enough to meet [his fans] outside and across the globe” but it remained obvious that he dislikes press and the general trappings of fame. He apologized for his awkwardness at the end, saying “I’m not good at this stuff … Stuttering and stammering — I don’t know, they haven’t really diagnosed it yet,” and mentioned being disguised with prosthetics in order to “take his kids to the London Eye without people looking at [him like he’s] Johnny Depp.”</p>\n<p>Still, Depp’s assessment that he is not good at interviews was perhaps too self-critical. Over 90 minutes he walked the audience through his entire career, starting with his stint as a TV actor on “21 Jump Street,” right up to the present day. He related how unhappy he was acting for TV, “where you can only play one character for a long period of time” and end up “being a product,” along with the bizarre ways he tried to get fired, including refusing to remove a turban or inventing a peanut butter obsession for his character. He went on the describe his “instant” connection and three-hour-long conversation with Tim Burton, after seeing him at the coffee shop where they had agreed to meet “with his hair looking like there was an explosion at a hardware store and … chewing on his coffee spoon. I walk into a joint, I know that’s the guy I’m talking to,” Depp said of the encounter, “Even if it’s not Tim Burton.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Depp had glowing things to say about everyone he has worked with and even his insistence that Al Pacino is “certifiably insane” was more loving than not. He was particularly emotional about the late Marlon Brando, whom he described as “a hero, a father, a mentor, a brother and a friend.” He again demonstrated his distaste at some aspects of the industry, though, when describing how his agent received a call after his friend’s death, asking if he now wanted to release “The Brave,” the movie he had produced and starred in with Brando some years earlier. Depp was disgusted at this attempt to have Brando “exploited and looked upon as a freak or some novelty,” a sentiment that merited a lot of applause from the audience. That said, the film’s abysmal reception when it premiered at Cannes could also have contributed to this decision, although Depp clearly isn’t afraid of making mistakes and claimed at the end that the possibility that “[he] could fall flat on [his] face” is a vital part of being an actor.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the event made clear that Johnny Depp has not only achieved a staggering amount of success but has also done a lot to earn it, including trying to contract heat stroke to perfect the reeling swagger of Captain Jack Sparrow. He remained humble, however, making constant references to the hard work of his agent of 30 years, Tracy, and avoided any hints of pretentiousness. He was particularly flippant about method actors, who he envisaged “at the craft table refusing to eat those Doritos because [they’re] Henry the Eighth,” and said that he knows he’ll see them “in the bar later, because [they’ve] got more problems than [he does].”</p>\n<p>A similar humility was displayed by Leonard Maltin who, though not an international film star, had reason to think highly of himself, since it was his first time conducting the Modern Master interview since the award was renamed in his honour and he was described by Mark Scher, the president of SBIFF, as a “rockstar.” Maltin, though, attributed his success as a film critic to having “broke in at the right time” when it was still possible to become established through “old school print journalism,” stating that he “wouldn’t want to be breaking in today … [since] the internet’s changed everything.” Maltin arrived at the red carpet with his daughter as his date and was affable and eager to talk to everyone, which was probably why he got on well with Depp, who could be seen leaning over to talk to him while the film clips were playing.</p>\n<p>The interview ended with Black Mass director Scott Cooper appearing on stage to heap more compliments on Depp, who bashfully deflected these by making the “make it rain” gesture after being called generous. Depp, having accepted his award, said he was “lucky to get away with everything [he] got away with over the years” and focused on the “talent … [and] brilliance of men like Leonard Maltin.” Cooper, however, who said he’d “travelled the world espousing the virtues of Johnny Depp,” insisted that “there really is no one like Johnny” and called him “the most overlooked actor of the year” in reference to his Oscar snub. From the response this got from a, by that point, very tired audience, it was clear they agreed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68124\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68124\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/","id":5867,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[5866,5865,5864],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Edge of Glory: Ronan and Larson awarded at SBIFF","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Saiorse-Ronan_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Saiorse-Ronan_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Saoirse Ronan and Brie Larson were given the prestigious Outstanding Performer of the Year award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Monday, Feb. 9.

Making SBIFF history, Larson called in via Skype to recount her history as an actress.</p>\n<p>“I started auditioning when I was six or seven years old,” she said. “Been at this for about 20 [years]. It’s been a very long road, but I wouldn’t want it to be any different. I wouldn’t change it — it brings me closer to who I am.”</p>\n<p>After a year of acting in plays, her mother got her an agent and she started appearing in fake commercials for Jay Leno.</p>\n<p>Larson got her first big break in “The United States of Tara” as Kate Gregson, a role she was initially rejected for. “It set me on my path,” she said. She would go on to co-star in “21 Jump Street,” “Short Term 12” and “Room,” the film she was awarded for.</p>\n<p>For her role as Ma, a woman kept captive with her son in a shed for seven years, Larson lost fat and gained muscle and consulted with a trauma specialist. She described how she and discovered the film on an emotional level as shooting went on. Like her character’s son Jack, she ended up missing the warm security of “Room” after the crew moved out into the chilly cityscape of Toronto.</p>\n<p>Larson graciously accepted her Outstanding Performer of the Year Award before leaving the call to catch her plane.</p>\n<p>Then, Saoirse Ronan, clad in white, walked onstage with a box of popcorn. As she sat down, she said, “I just realized Brie and I are wearing the same dress,” much to the audience’s amusement.</p>\n<p>The actress, famed for “Atonement” and “The Host,” was awarded for the romantic drama “Brooklyn” — which is where she was born, according to the moderator.</p>\n<p>Not so, Ronan corrects him: she came from the Bronx. “Obviously. Clearly I was born in the Bronx. Could you not tell by my sassy attitude?”</p>\n<p>Like her character Eilis Lacy, Ronan’s parents were Irish immigrants. Her mother worked as a nanny and her father worked a variety of jobs, including actor, bartender and construction worker.</p>\n<p>One of her first acting gigs came when her father cast her in a surrealist short film. “I started acting when I was very young. Being exposed to a group of young, creative people who interacted with me when I was a kid inspired me to be like them.”</p>\n<p>Ronan’s early experience made her adept at accents, which she demonstrated to the audience by adopting typical Valley Girl twang. She would go on to star in “Atonement” alongside Keira Knightley, which earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>She later played the teenage assassin Hanna in the film of the same name. Ronan recounted doing weightlifting and practicing martial arts for the role. A clip played, showing her killing Michelle Dockery’s character. “I snapped Lady Mary’s neck,” she tells a laughing audience. “So sorry.”</p>\n<p>For “Brooklyn,” Ronan was able to deeply sympathize with her character. She eventually moved away from her family to live in London and became very homesick.</p>\n<p>“There was a part in a movie when I tell Jim Broadbent ‘I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.’ I know that feeling … everyone’s come from someplace else. We need to make that first step out the front door, and it’s frightening.”</p>\n<p>Then event concluded with SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling taking the stage to sing the praises of Ronan, causing her to tear up as she graciously accepted her golden trophy.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point of taking a photo now, my makeup’s ruined. It’s important me to remember how important the work is and how important it is to make film and stories on stage or a film set. It’s what I love to do, and I get to work with wonderful people. Thanks for listening to us go on for the last hour. I hope you have a nice night, and thank you for coming.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/","id":5868,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5867,5866,5865],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
