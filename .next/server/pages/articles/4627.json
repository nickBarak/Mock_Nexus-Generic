Community Service District</a> (CSD) board of supervisors, which will be put to a vote in November.</p>\n<p>The CSD is a proposed form of local government in I.V. with the ability to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>It will appear as Measure E on the November ballot and require a majority vote to pass. All candidates running for office as the board of directors will be listed on the ballot, along with a tax designed to partially fund the CSD.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which outlines specific powers for the I.V.

For the inaugural election in November, two four-year positions have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates.</p>\n<p>Freeman, who was the first to file for candidacy, is the founder of software company Cydia and a 16-year I.V. resident. He joined the race shortly after an unsuccessful run for Santa Barbara County Supervisor in June.

His first assignment was in October 2015 when AB 3 was signed into law. From then on, he said he picked up as many assignments as possible for the Tuesday night meetings.</p>\n<p>“These outreach meetings are a large reason why I decided to run in the first place,” Brandt said in an email.

Off-Campus Senator.</p>\n<p>“I want to bring to the table the students and residents of Isla Vista who are not often normally politically engaged,” Jordan said in an email. “They will need to be part of the solution if we want the CSD to be widely successful.”</p>\n<p>Hedges is a local pastor and volunteer chaplain for the I.V. Foot Patrol and has lived in I.V. since he first arrived in 1968 as a UCSB student. He is running for the director position because he “got drafted” by other community members, he said.</p>\n<p>“I responded favorably to that because I believe in what is being done with the Community Services District,” he said. After living in I.V. for 48 years, he said he has been in a “unique position” to have observed and been “right in the middle of” much of I.V. history.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time I have heard a strategy that really moves this community forward toward identity and a voice,” he said. “It may not have been time for [the CSD] decades ago, but it is time now.”</p>\n<p>The four new candidates will be officially registered with the county elections office after finishing paperwork due August 12, according to Hector Gonzalez-Loera, the Santa Barbara County elections supervisor. Prior to dropping out, Covolo was the only candidate that had filed completely, Gonzalez-Loera said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-08/candidates-make-a-run-for-office-in-isla-vista/","id":4627,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4626,4625,4624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Pardall Center to provide the community with food and information on local resources.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Resource Fair is a public event which will feature several different organizations, including Committee of Student Well Being (COSWB), I.V. Food Co-Op, Department of Public Worms, Health and Wellness and Environment Affairs Board. The organizations will offer information about their resources, answer questions and host free food giveaways.</p>\n<p>IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim said the Resource Fair will bring people together in I.V., which is the goal of IVCRC.</p>\n<p>“As IVCRC, our goal and intention for having this committee to begin with is to bring this community together — bring everyone together — and I think the Resource Fair is a great way [to do so],” Lim said. “Not just for UCSB students to know what resources are available for them, but because it’s in I.V., we can have families come, and different people around the community come.”</p>\n<p>Lim said the event will inform attendees of the resources available to them provided by multiple I.V. and UCSB organizations.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of people don’t know what’s available to them, and to have this [event] and present it to them in one day, in one space …” Lim said. “I’m excited for it to become a really big part of what we do as a community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and third-year art and sociology double-major Aimee Hanna said she is looking forward to the event and what it can offer to the community.</p>\n<p>“This event is about feeding people, letting people know all about the resources that are available to them and allowing for these things to become accessible,” Hanna said. “It’s for folks to really come together and realize how we can all come together to make a better community.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC secretary and third-year psychology major Tai Kang said A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen inspired the decision to host the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“When Aimee and I first got our positions in IVCRC, we were really interested in food security,” Kang said. “I suggested it to Aimee because I read a bunch of articles on food security, so we went to the Food Bank, where we met Tuyen, and she was the one who gave us the idea for the Resource Fair.”</p>\n<p>According to Kang, Nguyen asked IVCRC to take on the project because A.S. Food Bank lacked the time and resources.</p>\n<p>“We have all the student lock-ins and the fees to do so, and it’d be a great resource to the students,” Kang said. “I think that big thanks has to [go to] Tuyen because she was truly the one who inspired us to do this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the I.V. Resource Fair has been in the works for some time, though it has been unsuccessful until now.</p>\n<p>“It was something that some of our previous leadership wanted to do last year, and we started to do a couple resource fairs with some community folks to begin to look at and model,” Nguyen said. “Something that already exists in the community, such as the Healthy Food pantry provided by the Isla Vista Youth Projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Nguyen, A.S. Food Bank met with IVCRC over the summer, during which the committee chose to pick up the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re super thankful to them to put forth their resources and attention,” Nguyen said. “They are amazing and they’re actually the lead; we’re here to actually just be a partner in their particular project.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said A.S. Food Bank will provide food at the I.V. Resource Fair.</p>\n<p>“Our role would be to help support and provide pantry items,” Nguyen said. “We have a variety of produce that folks can sift through, but this is a way in which we can provide a different access.”</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental science major Colleen McCamy said she is looking forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a really cool event,” McCamy said. “[It’s] helpful for students to explore the different resources here in the community and on campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66171\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66171\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-resource-fair-to-provide-information-on-local-organizations/","id":4624,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[4623,4622,4621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"8th Annual Pardall Carnival Showcases Campus Organizations, I.V.

IVCRC additionally reached out to local restaurants to cater to the event, such as Ike’s Place, Silvergreens and Blaze Pizza, altogether expanding the tasty range of amenities the carnival had to offer.</p>\n<p>Spudnuts Donuts drew in crowds with free donut bites, green tea boba and coupons for their next visit, nestled among the herds of passing students.</p>\n<p>“The main goal of the event is to start off the year with all of the community united,” said Jennifer Kim, external chair of IVCRC. “It isn’t closed off just to UCSB students; we aim for the families in the community to come out and enjoy the fun as well!”</p>\n<p>Organizations outside of USCB took advantage of this opportunity, inviting students to get to know the resources available to them beyond the campus in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>Acacia Counseling and Wellness, for example, had a colorful board of post-its near the ferris wheel that carnival goers could add to. Students circled the board to write words of encouragement to share with their fellow peers, putting them on display to pass on to the next person in need of a positive pick-me-up.</p>\n<p>Ruby Aranki, a fourth year student and administrative manager of the organization, said the purpose of the activity is not only to “destigmatize the current notion of mental health but also raise awareness of the current outlets available to serve those who suffer with depression or anxiety disorders.” With their upcoming $1 yoga sessions available to all members of the Isla Vista community, Acacia plans to put all proceeds towards a student therapy fund for those unable to afford the cost of counseling.</p>\n<p>When asked about her impression of the I.V. community thus far, first-year student Emily Hong noted that she loved how the community is so tight-knit and welcoming and the fun extends “beyond the frathouse.”</p>\n<p>“It kind of reminds students that I.V. isn’t all about the party reputation you expect coming into it, and it’s completely avoidable if it’s not your thing,” Hong said. “In my opinion I thought the carnival was a great way to kick off the new year, and with all the food and carnival games there was something fun for everyone to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Kim rested easy at the end of the event she helped organize, noting that although it got hectic behind the scenes, the shortfalls meant nothing compared to the success of the event as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how it all came together the day of and all the happy faces of people coming to the stands, it really made the hard work pay off,” Kim said.</p>\n<p><em>See more at <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-01/in-photos-pardall-carnival-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">In Photos: Pardall Carnival 2016</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72779\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72779\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-02/8th-annual-pardall-carnival-showcases-campus-organizations-i-v-community/","id":4625,"author":{"id":104,"name":"Aly Giammanco"},"related":[4624,4623,4622],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Board Considers Solution to I.V.

The IVMP mandates regular street parking surveys and stipulates that if the survey finds a parking vacancy rate below 15 percent for three consecutive UCSB academic quarters, the county will implement a permit parking program to bring parking vacancy rates back above the 15 percent mark. Many I.V. residents take issue with the 2013 survey findings, claiming I.V. parking is more impacted than the survey suggested and requires a more immediate solution. The Commission ultimately voted to recommend IVMP’s existing decision to continue surveys before implementing a permit program.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division Matt Schneider said parking surveys, conducted by Fehr and Peers Transportation Consultants, help monitor parking vacancy rates.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The purpose of the parking survey … is to monitor the vacancy rate, with 15 percent vacancy rate being the tipping point,” Schneider said. “Based on the current data we have available, we are below that threshold. There certainly will be a need once we cross that to develop a more robust parking program.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Daniel Blough said a parking survey is not necessary, as parking in I.V. is clearly impacted.</p>\n<p>“On that one issue I just can’t see wasting the money or the time,” Blough said. “I don’t need a survey to tell me there is a problem.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Joan Hartmann said parking surveys should monitor parking until results “trigger” a program.</p>\n<p>“It may be that we already have a strong sense that there is not enough parking, that it has already met the trigger since that survey was done in 2013, but I think we need ongoing surveys to see if there is change,” Hartmann said. “It is mrely a monitoring program and if we have other strategies to deal with parking, then we would like to see those changes on the ground.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said UCSB faculty and staff parking may be impacting I.V. due to insufficient on-campus parking, meaning improved UCSB parking could help I.V.</p>\n<p>“Maybe there are other things in addition to the parking permit program that we can be working on,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees member and UCSB alum Jonathan Abboud said I.V. should have a way to locally oversee the proposed permit program.<br>\n“I personally would support moving the plan forward now, but we should have an Area Planning Commission in Isla Vista in the future to oversee the implementation of the plan to make it more community-reflective and more community-based,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said I.V. needs an effective parking solution because many students depend on cars for transportation.</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes, it is dismissed that students need cars, but oftentimes it is very vital that they have them, so adequate parking really needs to be considered,” Minoiefar said. “The landlords’ use of high parking fees for their parking spots is an issue.”</p>\n<p>The Commission will send its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which will consider the revised IVMP this winter. If the Board adopts the updates, it will submit the IVMP to the California Coastal Commission in Santa Barbara County in Spring 2016.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/","id":4626,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4625,4624,4623],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
