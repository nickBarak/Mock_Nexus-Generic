I was a sophomore at UC Santa Barbara when a troubled young man violently ran down my classmates with his car in Isla Vista. Those kinds of memories stick with you forever. It’s times like this, in moments of tragedy, that we need to come together and lean on one another for support. A tragedy like this calls to the members of the community to comfort each other because the days ahead will be difficult. The families, friends, teachers and classmates of the victims are unfortunately dealing with something life-changing. It’s shocking and heartbreaking to lose loved ones and I know many of you feel helpless. I encourage you to attend candlelight vigils and reach out to the community and volunteer in any way you can.</p>\n<p>I am thankful that I have the opportunity to give back to the families who are going through a terrible tragedy through my company, Greek U. I also want to take this opportunity to speak out against the negative connotations about Greek organizations. As a company that serves fraternities and sororities, I know that Greeks have always represented love, respect, leadership and philanthropy. No one can take that spirit away from you. Having been the main targets of this tragedy, try to keep your heads high and remember why you pledged: because the bonds you form are strong and unbreakable.<br>\n<em>Daniel Passov is the owner of Greek U. </em></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, May 29, 2014 print edition of the Daily Nexus.<br>\nViews expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Multi-hyphenate screenwriter, director and producer Adam McKay strives to answer this question with his most recent film, “Vice.” Returning to the screen as another husband and wife dynamic duo, Christian Bale and Amy Adams star as Dick and Lynne Cheney, examining Dick Cheney’s rise to prominence, beginning with his days as a White House intern all the way through his term as vice president of the United States and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Vice” is a far cry from any other biopic of the time period, and, quite frankly, should not be compared to other dramatizations of political events or careers. As people lean into the habit of glorifying the Bush Administration, McKay seeks to drag his audience back to reality — reminding them of the atrocities committed during the years that Bush and Cheney occupied the executive branch. He bluntly reminds us of this through shocking scenes depicting the bombing of Iraqi civilians and the use of torture at American-run detainee camps like Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Unlike contemporaries such as “Darkest Hour”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or “The King’s Speech,” the story of Cheney’s insidious rise to power is riddled with humor that hangs over the audience like a stormcloud, time jumps and one rather peculiar Shakespearean scene. Also unlike the stories of glorious kings, presidents and prime ministers, Bale’s Cheney stars as the antihero of the film, which becomes more and more obvious with his ever-increasing preponderance of power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most difficult tasks of the entire film is the humanization of Vice President Cheney. In depicting a man notorious for his cunning abuse of executive power, willingness to commit horrific crimes against humanity in the name of targeting “enemy combatants” and a snakelike ability to turn on family and friends for the sake of political gain, McKay and Bale certainly had their work cut out for them. While it is quite apparent that the film pins the devastating Iraq War and rise of terrorist organizations like ISIS on Cheney, it also attempts to intersperse moments throughout the plot that serve as a reminder that even the most cold-hearted and ruthless powermongerers have feelings too. A particular soft spot of Cheney’s examined in “Vice” is his relationship with his daughter Mary, his support of her sexuality and his concern for her privacy during his campaign for vice president. However, McKay never lets the audience stray far from the reminder of Cheney’s green light on numerous war crimes. McKay masters the juxtaposition of Cheney’s life as a family man versus that as a ruthless global instigator. In one particular scene, the Cheney family is seen eating a meal on an idyllic porch, surrounded by laughter and innocuous conversation; suddenly, we are transported to Iraq in which we are faced with deafening blasts, burning bodies and the screams of soldiers and civilians alike. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a movie that can sometimes get lost in its storytelling, what really sets “Vice” apart is its remarkable cast. It is no surprise that Bale and Adams keep getting cast as a pair, and this film is no exception; the two deliver a subtle yet still electrifying chemistry and balance each other’s energy to deliver a pair of powerful yet nuanced performances. Additionally, true standout performances are delivered by Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld  and Tyler Perry as Secretary of State Colin Powell. Rockwell disappears into the role of the younger President Bush, and his village idiot-like naïveté expertly furthers the plot of Cheney’s merciless ascent to power. Carell’s Rumsfeld seems to be a step outside of the actor’s wheelhouse, though at times he provided comic relief as the old-school and crude Secretary of Defense. Perry artfully portrays the far-too-smart Powell, reaching his peak in a scene in which, at the behest of Cheney, he regretfully delivers a speech to the UN encouraging the disarmament of Iraq. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phenomenal makeup, transformative cast and at times bizarre employment of storytelling tropes have made “Vice” one of the most unique films of the year.

I was a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara during the post-Reagan, George H. W. Bush era in the late 80s and early 90s. Nearly 25 years later, UCSB is still fraught with the issues of violence and sexual assault we struggled with in 1990 and beyond. In 2014, there is more information, better data, bigger guns, more deadly violence and yet the same issues of sexual entitlement and misogyny remain. In fact, the misogyny might be worse.</p>\n<p>During my time at USCB, President Bush Sr. and Congress were busy sledgehammering women’s right to choose by enacting parental consent laws, unnecessary and prohibitive waiting periods and other restrictions. These restrictions set in motion many of the huge barriers to safe abortions that we still face and fight against today. Meanwhile, our college sex lives existed within a new age of compulsory condom use. The free flowing sex of the 70s and early 80s was over. We were the first generation to come into our sexual agency with the reality of AIDS. “Sex=death” had begun.</p>\n<p>A fire was flaring inside me that demanded agency over my own body and that violence against women, in general, had to stop.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>An anonymous group of women started to take action on campus to raise awareness and challenge the community to do more to stop rape. They were vocal about what was happening to our reproductive rights. The Creative Underground Network of Truthful Sisters (aka The C.U.N.T.S.) took Isla Vista and UCSB by storm. The C.U.N.T.S. would dress all in black and wear black hoods, taking cues from the Israeli-founded anti-war activist group Women In Black. They showed up at “Little Sister Rush” and frat houses where women in the C.U.N.T.S. had actually been raped. They showed up to protest in the midst of the fraternity<br>\nfundraisers for the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center. The protests were silent. C.U.N.T.S. would hold signs with messages, hand out flyers and stickers with a compelling, reticent presence.</p>\n<p>It angered people. It incited action and debate. Dialogue.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to believe, but there was no Internet yet. That made the Daily Nexus (which existed only in print) the centrifugal force of campus communication and information. Every other week a new dialogue raged on the pages of the Nexus Op Ed section as students battled over whether what the C.U.N.T.S. were doing was right. Much of the controversy focused on their tactics, e.g. spray painting messages intended to raise awareness about rape on the side of a fraternity house. But many wrote passionately about the issues the C.U.N.T.S. were calling to attention.</p>\n<p>I worked at Morninglory Music in Isla Vista at the time, where I often overheard animated, sometimes angry conversations about the C.U.N.T.S. “Say what you want,” I’d sometimes interject when I’d had enough, “But the C.U.N.T.S. have already been successful: they have your attention. They have every student and faculty member on this campus talking about these issues. Whatever your critique is, the fact is that they have made you talk — and made you think.”</p>\n<p>I was a young feminist coming into consciousness about gender inequities and power imbalance. I used my bandwidth on air at KCSB, the campus radio station, to be more political. I was a woman on fire with a mission to change the way we learn and experience sexuality and power. It was the beginning of my journey into the sexuality field.</p>\n<p>The most common question I am asked when someone learns that I am a sexual empowerment coach is, “How did you get into that line of work?” UCSB was where it began for me. I could see how women’s sexual oppression and experiences of violence needed to change in a big way, in a watershed way. It took so much away from the women I knew.</p>\n<p>The energy required to fend off unwanted attention, to report a rape that will rarely be prosecuted, to keep saying “no” until we are worn down, to try to dress in a way that might help us stay safe and unnoticed, to be on alert when walking alone, to get ourselves past all the barriers to care and get to the clinic in time, to fight to get things like the Violence Against Women Act passed, to get the restraining orders, to protect our children, and to heal from assault — that energy would fuel the entire world. Men rape women, using our bodies and sex as weapons to fight wars and to emasculate their enemies. Our wounds keep them in power while we are again focused on the work of healing and changing systems of patriarchy that continue to oppress us around the world.<br>\nRight now there are hundreds of girls still missing in Nigeria because of their pursuit of their birthright to education. This is a barbaric act of misogyny designed to keep these women where they are, and to keep us all scared. Last month in Connecticut, a high school girl was murdered in her school stairwell after turning down a boy who asked her to go to junior prom. And in idyllic Santa Barbara, a young man with a dream to annihilate an entire sorority house killed six and injured 13 because he didn’t get the sex from those he felt entitled to.</p>\n<p>All of these issues are part of a worldwide misogyny that denies women human rights, agency over our sexuality and bodies and the energy that we need to self-actualize our dreams. They are part of a misogyny that defines women as less valuable than men are — it defines sexual access to women as a privilege of maleness and an unequivocal expression of masculinity. Women are still treated as property, as weapons of war, as bargaining chips and as trophies by men.<br>\nWomen are outpacing men in education. Women are claiming our sexuality. Women are making more money. Women are (still) demanding birth control and access to abortion. Women are speaking out. Women are starting movements. Women are fighting back.</p>\n<p>Women are standing together, and it is only as men stand with us that we will finish these seemingly endless battles. No oppressed people overcome systemic oppression without members of those in power and privilege standing with them and working for change.</p>\n<p>I call on men to join this battle. It’s the same battle that keeps men’s emotional vocabulary limited to anger and punishes them for tenderness. It’s the same system that creates such a limited idea of what men can be that when they don’t fit the “alpha male” avatar, they implode. It’s the same one that teaches men that their limited choices for acting out their masculinity are sexual conquest or violence. It’s the same one that teaches men they are entitled to women and that if women are giving sex, they should always take it, always be ready for it and always want it. Gender oppression directly impacts us all.</p>\n<p>Changing cultural norms is no small task. All forms of violence can be traced back to traditional gender roles, which create a larger system of patriarchy that limit men’s emotional agency and women’s freedom, safety and political power. Every single one: War. Sexual Assault. Domestic Violence. Hate Crimes. Gay Bashing. Street harassment. Genocide. Annihilation. But until we broaden ideas of what it is to “be a man” and change what women can do, say or choose, we will continue to be plagued by these massive problems. Guns or no guns, men who think they are entitled to women’s bodies, sexuality and affection will continue to act violently towards women — and, themselves. Traditional gender norms harm us all.</p>\n<p>It is with both deep sadness and tremendous hope that I have engaged in dialogue about these complex issues this week. I was challenged on Twitter for participating in the “YesAllWomen hashtag because it allegedly gives more power to a man who murdered for infamy. I liken #YesAllWomen to the C.U.N.T.S. and see what just happened in Isla Vista as yet another catalyst for dialogue about men’s sexual entitlement and women’s sexual vulnerability, new awareness about how toxic ideas of masculinity hurt us all and an opportunity to break new ground on a long-overdue and sorely needed healing of sexuality.</p>\n<p>For the truly sexually empowered, there is no sexual entitlement. There is only sexual responsibility and agency. That sexual agency cannot impede another person’s agency, for then it becomes control, manipulation and violence. No one owes anybody else anything sexually — not the person you are on a date with, the one who doesn’t want to go on a date or the one you’ve been married to for 20 years. I envision a world where all people are sexually empowered in their bodies and desires, expressing their sexuality from a locus of self-knowledge, with total agency over their choices. Sexual empowerment is needed for all of us now. We must address gender and sexuality maturely and men must raise their voices with us so we can all heal.<br>\n<em>Amy Jo Goddard is a Sexual Empowerment Coach and UCSB aluma who has  taught courses at UCSB as a visiting instructor.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

In this new “Beatles Revolutions” film series curated by the Carsey-Wolf Center, “A Hard Day’s Night” kicked things off last Thursday with a free screening for students and community members, followed by a Q&amp;A session with journalist Ivor Davis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for their “Script to Screen” series, this year the Carsey-Wolf Center introduces “Beatles Revolutions.” This winter film series is dedicated to showcasing the lives of those four iconic Liverpool musicians who changed music forever. Examining the various ways The Beatles inspired revolutions not only in music but also in politics and culture, the series includes several different film styles revolving around these topics. With free screenings of the documentaries, animation films, live performances and adaptation films, Pollock is now offering music fans and film buffs alike a wide scope of the true effect The Beatles had on the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Pollock showed “A Hard Day’s Night,” and Beatles fans of all ages made an appearance to the sold-out screening. While I had been to the Pollock several times prior to this, I had never actually gone to an event there that sold out every ticket. And, after viewing this film, it’s easy to understand why it did. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the film came out in 1964 at the beginning of The Beatles’ vast career, it accurately captures the wave of Beatlemania that was to come. Director Richard Lester uses an interesting filming style that works to both document the group’s antics as well as follow a very loose yet fun plotline. Lester’s style is described by the Carsey-Wolf Center as a “black-and white, semi-documentary style with a cartoonish energy that celebrates the Beatles at work and at play.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A Hard Day’s Night” differs from a lot of movies I’ve seen, as it sticks to no formal film rules and often dances on the fringe of a fictitious and realistic plot. The whole film is centered around the band traveling to appear on television for a live performance, only to face several obstacles along the way and sing their own songs while they’re at it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As The Beatles are musicians before actors, the decision to use the film and band’s popularity to further showcase their music was quite an obvious one. While normally musical scenes in movies can be used to push a story forward or serve as a transition, “A Hard Day’s Night” uses the tracks of the album that have the same name as the film primarily to imbue them with some sort of exposure. Cynically, one can view this film as merely a giant advertisement for the band’s latest album release at the time; however, The Beatles fan in me refuses to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filled with witty jokes, thick British accents and classic Beatles tunes like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “And I Love Her” and, of course, “A Hard Day’s Night,” this film gave its Pollock Theater audience a show to remember. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this screening of “A Hard Day’s Night,” Pollock Theater will be showing several other Beatles-related flicks throughout the course of the 2019 Winter Quarter. Next up is the 1970 film “Let It Be,” which is also known as the last original release from The Beatles and will be playing Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. This film documents the group’s process of recording the songs for their final album and includes footage of their last live public performance on the rooftop of Apple Corps in London. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more Beatlemania, visit the Pollock on Feb. 12 for “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” Feb. 27 for “Across the Universe” and, finally, March 2 for “Yellow Submarine.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/beatlemania-hits-pollock-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/beatlemania-hits-pollock-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/beatlemania-hits-pollock-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/beatlemania-hits-pollock-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/beatlemania-hits-pollock-theater/","id":5792,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[5791,5790,5789],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
