As the officer walked the subject to his patrol vehicle, the belligerent bronco began yelling incoherent words.</p>\n<p>He then got angry with the officer, who he accused of ruining his “stunt” while he was “trying to impress the chicks.”</p>\n<p>Saving the man from any woman who would fall for such bravado, the cowboy was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>No Freebies at Freebirds!<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 6, 2:30 a.m. – Officers walking along Embarcadero del Norte overheard what sounded like a fight.</p>\n<p>Upon further investigation, the deputy determined that a Freebirds employee was detaining a 20-year-old man who was attempting to break out with an unpaid-for burrito in tow.</p>\n<p>The officer detained the subject, who reeked of alcohol and whose eyes were bloodshot and watery. The man was unable to maintain balance, and officers had to restrain him to prevent him from falling over.</p>\n<p>The burrito burglar was then arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Hell Hath No Fury Like a (Drunk) Woman Scorned<br>\nFriday, Oct. 5, 11:00 p.m. – An officer standing on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive observed a woman staggering down the sidewalk by herself.</p>\n<p>As the deputy approached to check on her welfare, the 18-year-old woman yelled, “I hate you, get away from me.”</p>\n<p>The officer identified himself and said he was only trying to help her before asking the woman what was wrong.</p>\n<p>The subject told him that she was having the “worst day of [her] life” because her boyfriend had just broken up with her.</p>\n<p>When he asked her where she was going, the woman said she was headed home to 989 Abrego Rd., a non-existent address. He then asked her how much alcohol she had consumed, and she said “none,” despite exhibiting several signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p>When asked what year she was born, the heartbroken honey replied, “1929.”</p>\n<p>Because the woman had no friends to look after her, the deputy decided to arrest her for her own safety.</p>\n<p>During booking, the woman repeatedly lied about her age and expressed her distaste for the IVFP officers, saying “I am 19. I fucking hate you guys… I hate you, leave me alone.”</p>\n<p>As the woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, she would switch between crying uncontrollably to yelling and acting belligerent. For the safety of other detainees, she was placed in her own cell.</p>\n<p>Whiskey Bent and Jail Bound<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 6, 12:19 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive noticed a 21-year-old man stumbling in the way of oncoming traffic.</p>\n<p>When contacted, the swaggering subject was mumbling incoherently and was unable to answer simple questions.</p>\n<p>Eventually he said to the deputy, “I’m drunk, you can arrest me if you want.”</p>\n<p>The officer obliged, but was unaware that the easy arrest would become such a hassle. During transport, the subject began vomiting, which continued all the way to the IVFP office.</p>\n<p>During booking, the man was unable to walk on his own, unable to focus his eyes and gave conflicting information about his identity, confusing his phone and social security numbers.</p>\n<p> The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As the man’s growing frustration got the better of him, he began to cry.</p>\n<p>Officers then arrested the man for public intoxication. While deputies transported him to jail, the man became very emotional and again started to cry.</p>\n<p>The subject confessed that his girlfriend had just broken up with him, and he had only wanted to give her a birthday card. The man admitted that he had made a mistake by drinking too much “cheap” vodka and apologized to officers for getting plastered.</p>\n<p>The man was booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Flash of Brilliance Belligerence<br>\nFriday, Nov. 10, 5:20 a.m. – Officers walking by a bus stop on Camino del Sur observed a 21-year-old man lying on a bench.</p>\n<p>As a deputy approached the man, he saw that the subject’s pants were unzipped and his penis was exposed. The man was lying in a pool of urine, which streamed down the bench into a nearby gutter.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to wake the leaky lawbreaker by shouting at the subject, but eventually had to administer a sternum rub to elicit a response.</p>\n<p>When the wiz kid woke up, he was extremely disoriented and repeatedly told officers that he lived on “Ryan Street.”</p>\n<p>Since that street does not exist anywhere near Isla Vista, the officer decided to arrest the filthy flasher for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed and left to mull over his own mess, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>All I Want to Do Is Bicycle!!!<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 25, 9:15 p.m. – Deputies were patrolling the 6700 block of El Colegio Road when they saw a 22-year-old man zoom past them on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>As the subject sped past the officers, he fell off the bike and flew through the air, before ultimately crashing on to the pavement. He stumbled for several yards before regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the man picked up his bike and threw it to the ground. He then flopped down on to the street, where he sat, pouting, until an officer approached him.</p>\n<p>The deputy detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the surly cyclist’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When the officer began questioning the subject, the man attempted to answer -but only managed to say, “I live at 555… ah… I’m not sure.”</p>\n<p>Despite the commendable effort to remember where he lived, the man was completely oblivious to his surroundings and could not even stand up. To ensure the man’s own safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/","id":3882,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3881,3880,3879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Why is the Rum Always Gone?\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Why is the Rum Always Gone?<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy contacted the man, he noticed the subject had a fixed look in his eyes – silently staring as if in a trance.</p>\n<p>The officer helped the man to the curb, and placed him on the ground in a seated position while he filled out the police report for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The mesmerized man remained mute during the process, and the deputy collected most of his information from the friend of the speechless subject.</p>\n<p>When the man stood up to be transported to the police station, a water bottle with dark liquid inside fell out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>The man ended his silent streak and told the deputy, “Hey, that’s Captain Morgan’s rum.”</p>\n<p>The officer told the man he did not care who’s liquor it was, and poured out the contents of the bottle before transporting the subject to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Getting Arrested<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 12:35 a.m. – Deputies stationed on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed an 18-year-old man stagger into the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The man walked right up to an oncoming car, forcing the driver to slam on his breaks and swerve to miss the subject.</p>\n<p>The deputy shinned a flashlight on the man, and ordered him to leave the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The subject eventually staggered to the south side of the road, where he met the officer with bloodshot eyes, as well as the strong odor of alcohol and urine.</p>\n<p>The man told the officer he was trying to find a ride home, but could not remember his address.</p>\n<p>The deputy offered the man a lift, which he readily accepted.
