Once I realized that there would always be someone better, I stopped worrying about trying to be the best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my 11 years of dance training, this was one of the things that became ingrained in me. My teacher used to tell my classmates and me that we should always look for the best dancer in the room and stand next to them. When I was younger, I took this advice to heart. I would stand next to whoever I thought was the best and aim to get my leg higher, do more turns or balance longer. This mindset led me to improve at a faster rate and to embrace challenges when I encountered them, rather than giving up when things got hard.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87978\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87978\" data-attachment-id=\"87978\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-05/mastering-your-mindset/changingyourmindset/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Changingyourmindset-e1557091787392.png?fit=650%2C502&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,502\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Changingyourmindset\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Changingyourmindset-e1557091787392.png?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Changingyourmindset-e1557091787392.png?fit=888%2C687&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87978\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Changingyourmindset-e1557091787392.png?resize=566%2C437\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"437\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87978\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I got older, this drive to challenge myself began to wane — I was jealous of people whom I perceived as better than me, and instead of using those people to motivate myself to improve, I got discouraged. I’m not sure why this change began, but I can only imagine it manifested from the mental health challenges I was encountering at the time. Toward the end of my senior year, I was stuck in a full-fledged spiral of self-doubt and negativity, and I couldn’t seem to find my way out.

The idea is that someone with a growth mindset believes that their intelligence and skill can improve over time and with experience, while in contrast, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and skills are fixed traits that cannot change. These beliefs are underlying, but they nonetheless dictate a lot about how we learn — Dweck’s research has shown that people with growth mindsets find more success and satisfaction in learning than those with a fixed mindset. But while this concept mainly focuses on the way we learn, Dweck also suggests that our mindsets can have a huge impact on other aspects of our lives as well, whether that be academic, professional or personal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was learning about this research and the different kinds of mindsets, I began to recognize myself as a “fixed” thinker, but I also noticed that I wasn’t always like this. I remembered when I was younger and eager to pick myself up each time I fell down, and whether it was in the classroom or the studio, I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes. Somewhere between tutus and teendom, I lost my capability to bounce back from perceived failures. After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change. But the question remained: how? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fixed mindset made my first year of college very difficult. I found myself often discouraged and simply giving up academically. I took a math class in the winter of my freshman year, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to overcome the overwhelming thought that I wasn’t good at math and never could be. I let the homework pile up and the self-doubt devour me. Remember: One of the identifying characteristics of someone with a fixed mindset is the belief that their baseline intelligence can’t be changed, and I was a textbook example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of my first year, I was rapidly losing confidence in who I could be academically and artistically. It wasn’t until the next fall that I had my lightbulb moment. One morning I went to my dramatic writing professor’s office hours to tell her I was excited to write but I was worried that I sucked, and she said something along the lines of “everyone sucks until they don’t.” It took me a while to warm up to the idea, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it’s OK to suck; in fact, everyone sucks at some point, and especially at the beginning. In that class, I delved into the world of podcasts about writing and books on dramatic writing, and I discovered three fundamental truths: 1) first drafts always suck, 2) you will face a lot of rejection, 3) the only way to be a good writer is to write. Learning these things through the lens of writing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something I love and am </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sensitive about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made me realize that they apply to everything.

No one is born amazing at math either. Or ballet. That’s not to say that some people don’t have natural proclivities toward certain subjects; of course, some people are born with arches that are perfect for pointe shoes or a natural sense of rhythm in their writing.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with those proclivities, it takes work to be great.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s OK to suck, and skills and intelligence are not stagnant </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we can always find ways to improve and grow. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, my mindset hasn’t changed overnight, and there are many days when I feel like I’ll never be a great writer or that my arabesque will never get higher. But in those times I have to remind myself that it’s OK to suck, and skills and intelligence are not stagnant </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we can always find ways to improve and grow. The best advice I can give to anyone struggling to motivate or believe in themselves is to welcome criticism and failure, because it can only make you more resilient. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants her fellow Gauchos to be fearless in the face of sucking and to grow from their failures.</span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

Cock rings are very simple and require little effort on the part of the sir. Just stretch the ring around his deep-V diver and have it settle around the base. And voila! Now, have sex.</p>\n<p>Before I move on, a word of advice: Do not invest in the ones that go inside of you. It is certainly uncomfortable to have a small device inside of you already when your Casanova is insistent on stabbing it further in with his wang. Just mellow out with the basic version. You’ll get comfortable with the idea of vibrators, he’ll enjoy mixing it up, but it’s all still familiar.</p>\n<p>Once invested in a vibrator of a higher caliber, line up in naughty spoons and have him enter you from behind. Bring your top leg up so that your fleshy flower is exposed and he can have full access to it. The angle is tight for you both and there’s going to be clitoral stimulation up the yin-yang. He can then hold the vibrator to it as he goes for the gold from behind. The dual action feels crazy good and you can both get off. I suppose this position would work for both of you lying on top of him or doggy-style, but I feel you both can balance better and focus on the task at hand with a greater deal of precision.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been foraying into the world of kink and my hook-up buddy played this little gem out for me (more on that delicious topic later!) Standing up with your arms behind your back (good luck with that), he has the vibrator. What I like about this one is that it can work for either g-spot vibrators or ones that stimulate your clit. He holds it to your bits, rubbing it back and forth, in and out, what have you. The catch? You cannot reach your happy ending until he says so. You must ask him. If he’s naughty, he’ll take a few moments to ponder your request. Once given the okay, the desperation will give way to wicked awesomeness. You should do this close to a cushioned surface, as you will most likely fall over and eat shit otherwise, Jello-legs.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are a guy and interested in how a vibrator would feel, that’s great. Why wouldn’t you want your junk to be electronically stimulated? We dig it, so why wouldn’t you? While I am fearful of referring to Cosmo’s suggestions, one in particular did seem safe and potentially enjoyable. Very simply, when she is going down on you, stick the vibrator to her cheek. The muted vibrations alongside her already righteous tongue lavishing should be pretty bomb.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, I leave you to fantasize about toys. Go forth, prosper and bask in all they have to offer. You should always be comfortable with your body. Doesn’t it seem a little silly to be unfamiliar with what’s between your legs?</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. has managed to make jello that much dirtier.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48191\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48191\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/lets-play-toys-bedroom/","id":6408,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6407,6406,6405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Toxic Friends No More!","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Therapeutic Thoughts","publish_date":"2019-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-1-e1556159637566.jpeg?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grace Wiley calls upon college students to cleanse their social lives of toxicity.

This is not high school, people. We don’t have classes with the same people five days a week, we do not have the same dependence on finding a group of people to eat lunch with and, thank god, we are not stuck in the same place for seven hours of our day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we have freedom. And not only does this mean being able to choose where we eat lunch and what classes we take, but it also means choosing who we spend our time with. This means that friendships are not obligatory, and we can find people who truly make us feel happy and fulfilled.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students need to become better at self-care in terms of determining which friendships are actually healthy.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am not saying that this task is easy. In the complicated social life of college, your friends are usually connected to your other friends to create a complex web of people you know, but do not always like. So, trying to get rid of a toxic friend that sits within a group of people you generally like is almost impossible. And I am not saying that I have all the solutions to these types of awkward situations; what I am saying is that it is important to recognize people in your life that repeatedly annoy and drain you. This doesn’t mean they are inherently horrible people — you just don’t want them in your house constantly, eating your beloved Ben &amp; Jerry’s The Tonight Dough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have had a series of epiphanies this quarter especially. I have reached the end of the honeymoon phase where everyone is nice, funny and a great friend. Some people are just friends more so out of obligation or for convenience, as we just don’t click with everybody. The same goes for friends in high school as well. At UCSB, I have learned what I want in my friends and the people I surround myself with. In high school, friends were more handed to us through similar activities and classes, but here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a difference between loving your friends for their faults and tolerating a toxic friendship because we are too nice or too lazy to express our feelings. Loving your friends for who they are should not translate to making you feel degraded or hurt constantly, but rather means appreciating the diversity amongst friends. This does not mean we should berid anyone that seems slightly irritating, as some of my best friends are individuals who I did not originally click with. However, that only means that active communication is even more important, so both friends understand each other and their wishes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, as we constantly cycle through who we see, we have the amazing ability to narrow down who we see in our daily schedule based on a prioritized list of qualities that we want in friends.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, it can be easier to recognize these qualities within romantic partners. Of course, this does not always mean that a break-up is clean, as sometimes even the most disgusting of partners tend to stick around, whether we like it or not. However, just like how our friends would tell us to break up with a person who is treating us poorly, I am also saying that this break-up, although messy and stressful, can also happen with friends, whether we’ve known them for 10 years or 10 months. At the same time, it is also important to understand that people are capable of change, and sometimes communicating your feelings is the most important step toward mending a broken friendship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking care of others can often be easier than taking care of ourselves.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Divorce is not an easy concept for anyone to deal with, especially while in the midst of college. Everyone hopes for an ideal, happy family environment to come back to as well as having a sense of “home.” Nevertheless, for many students this hope just doesn’t mirror their reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if adjusting to my first year in college wasn’t daunting enough, I came to UCSB fresh out of my parents’ divorce. I still find that admitting I have divorced parents isn’t something that naturally comes out of my mouth when people ask me about my home life. To this day, it’s still strange to wrap my mind around the fact that I am no longer a student with happily married parents at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I am fortunate enough to say is that I was able to experience growing up with parents who were happily together. Of course, I, like any other kid with married parents, took this sense of comfort for granted. It’s almost impossible not to when society defines the family norm as a happily married couple with kids.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I personally never had to face the hardships involved with splitting time between two different households or deciding where to celebrate holidays when I was a kid. Both my sister and I were lucky enough to have had a completely secure upbringing with little worries or concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet there are so many people my age that did not have these same comforts growing up, and I recall being a kid in elementary school and thinking it was really sad that some of my friends’ parents weren’t together. I would watch them pack their school backpacks with miscellaneous overnight things in order to go from dad’s house in the morning to mom’s house after dance practice. What I failed to grasp at that age was how strong these other kids were becoming as they coped with a less comfortable or stable childhood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lillian Cheeks, a second-year student at UCSB, had to learn independence at a young age when her dad moved out of their house. While speaking about growing up with a single parent, she said, “I learned to be insanely self-sufficient and make decisions for myself at a young age because I had no other choice. At times I felt like I was partly raising myself because my mom had to work extra shifts, meaning I was alone most of the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, kids who grow up with married parents become reliant on their family for most everyday tasks and learn self-reliance later in life. Many other students, like Lillian, had to maneuver through childhood without a secure family bond and were pushed to grow up before they were ready. As difficult as this must have been on her childhood experience, Lillian still acknowledges that this experience shaped her into the capable student and person she is today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to college already very independent and knew how to make decisions for myself,” Lillian said. Being thrown into college and adjusting to life on your own is a scary process for most, but Lillian’s past made her more comfortable in adjusting to adult life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephanie Silveria, another second-year student here at UCSB, also feels that the trauma of watching her parents’ divorce play out when she was a little girl helped shape her into the compassionate person she is today. She claims, “it has made me more tolerant and understanding with people and situations.” For this reason, she further expressed that even with all the hurt and pain she has experienced, she wouldn’t change the way things occurred even if she was given the option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some degree, I almost envy the people whose parents got divorced when they were young because it may have appeared completely normal when they were children. At a young age, there is a better chance of the child becoming accustomed to a new familial lifestyle and those adjustments can shape the individual into a strong, capable adult later in life.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 16,  my parents dropped a completely unexpected bomb: they were getting a divorce. I was old enough to realize that the family dynamic I had known thus far would forever change. My age </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along with the naivety I carried up until that point about happy families </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have made it even more difficult to cope with the divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Sydney Fishback, a third-year student at UCSB who was only 11 months old when her parents got divorced, discussed how she sympathizes with my experience. She expressed that it would have been much harder if she was older like I was when everything happened. “It would be harder because I would’ve been conditioned to seeing my parents together and used to knowing what it’s like to live with them both,” she noted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was perhaps one of the hardest things for me to adjust to. Today, I still struggle when people ask me if I’ll be going home for breaks. I have been forced to choose whether to visit my dad, who lives much closer now that he moved to SoCal last year, or to return to NorCal to my childhood home that I grew up in to see my mom. It still takes a moment for me to explain to others that the concept of “home” is ambiguous for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Complicated” is the best way to describe my life since my parents got divorced later in my life. Being in college and having to discover ways to see my parents, who live seven hours apart, has not been easy in the slightest. Whenever I become frustrated with my situation, it’s helpful to think about how lucky I was to have grown up with happy parents and that many other kids my age didn’t have this luxury. Although their marriage ended, I still have the memories that other people my age with divorced parents lack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether someone’s parents split up when they were a child or a teenager, there are bound to be both hardships and positives in each situation. It’s okay to have trouble with it at times. Whenever I need a breath, I take it. Taking a moment to realize that having an imperfect family situation is only making me stronger as an individual is the peace of mind that gets me through the worst of it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paige Holloway embraces the </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">difficulties of a nontraditional family structure. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae1996f9eafccabb0eb58d599ab3e649?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/paige-holloway/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Paige Holloway</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Paige Holloway is a Communication and Sociology major as well a write and assistant editor for On the Menu.
