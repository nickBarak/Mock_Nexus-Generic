Salcedo pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, the father of a Berkeley alumunus was charged with </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/13/father-of-uc-berkeley-alumnus-charged-in-college-admission-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allegedly paying a test-taker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take his son’s SAT test to help him gain admission to the university, as reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Cal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The father pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were no reported instances of backdoor admissions at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June’s audit is the first of two system-wide ECAS investigations into the UC admissions process; the second will be completed by the end of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit report made note of three specific suggestions to strengthen the UC application process: clearer documentation, improved verification protocols and stronger admissions procedures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure clear documentation, the audit suggests maintaining a “clear documentation trail” in order for admissions personnel to arrive at accurate admission decisions. The audit also calls for additional documentation for students applying on the basis of athletics or “special talent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the audit calls for a surveillance of donations and philanthropy to avoid admissions decisions “being made on the basis of expected financial gain to the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an applicant’s truthfulness, the audit suggests the UC bolster its current vetting techniques to make it more difficult for third parties to frame an applicant’s “special talents” to gain an upper hand in the admissions process. Furthermore, the audit noted a lack of accountability in monitoring a student athlete’s engagement in their respective sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of strengthening procedures, the audit reported a lack of processes in place to manage conflicts of interest in the admissions process and the “reporting structure” of athletics compliance offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit suggests an improvement of these processes to “prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/current-issues/admissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that while the UC believes its UC admissions process “works well and has significant and effective controls in place,” the UC “accept[s] all of the ECAS recommendations so we can continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take our zero tolerance policy extremely seriously — even one instance of admissions fraud is one too many,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano also implored each UC chancellor to develop their own “campus-specific” plans and tailor them to the ECAS’ recommendations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a specific plan for the UCSB campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of May, the California State Assembly took initial legislative steps towards improving university admissions processes with </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1383\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 1383</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would deny any university within the UC system the power to grant students special admittance, or “admission by exception,” unless the admittance is approved by three college administrators. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Will they be able to rise to the occasion and make a run for the next world cup?</p>\n<p>After a disappointing loss to Belgium in the round of 16, Head Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his team are focused for the upcoming opportunity. Although a young team lacking veteran leadership following the retirement of Landon Donovan, new faces and talent will step in place as they start their journey to Russia.</p>\n<p>Among these players lies the 23-year old striker Gyasi Zardes. The LA Galaxy forward subbed in the second half for Team USA and within 61-seconds assisted captain Clint Dempsey for the only goal scored in the game. Turns out the bright lights and big stage wasn’t too much for the young soccer player as he shined in the spotlight and continued to be in attack mode for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Dempsey was impressed by Zardes’ play, calling the forward a “dynamic” player that “will play a big part in the national team picture moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Other players on the rise include midfielder Alejandro Bedoya and goalkeeper Brad Guzan. The duo have been two critical components of Team USA’s success, specifically Bedoya’s play during the World Cup in Brazil and Guzan’s time in the Gold Cup since replacing fan favorite Tim Howard.</p>\n<p>Bedoya’s poise with the ball on the offensive end has been phenomenal. The New Jersey native put perfect placement on the ball for captain Michael Bradley to lock things up in a 1-1 stalemate against Panama on Tuesday. After learning so much in Brazil, Bedoya has stepped up to the plate and become a leader during Team USA’s summer run.</p>\n<p>Guzan has made an impact from the get go since replacing long-time goalie Tim Howard. In the five games that he’s started, the 30-year old has hosted a goal difference of +8, only conceding a total of five goals. Guzan also had seven saves in USA’s victory against Panama Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, it is the combined efforts of role players like Zardes, Bedoya, and Guzan that make the difference and will be the X-factor in giving Team USA a run in 2018. This roster isn’t centered around one major star like a Ronaldo or Messi but consists of a melting pot of role players that can impact the game with full force. If they work together as a unit this team may follow in the footsteps of the great US women’s national team.</p>\n<p>This is a new era for American soccer. After crucial years of tough losses and decisive heartbreakers, the time has come for the US to prove to others that it can be champions on the pitch. Now that the women’s team has done its part, it is up to the men to carry the torch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/","id":3260,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3259,3258,3257],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Regents: How Representative Are They of the UC?","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshots_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshots_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An overwhelming proportion of the student regents have come from UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first student regent to serve on the University of California Board of Regents, selected in 1975, hailed from UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carol Mock, a fourth-year political science major at the time of her appointment, was “the first student ever to become a board member in the institution’s 107 year history, and came as a result of passage of Proposition 4 in last November’s election,” a 1975 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the student regent position is a step forward in communications between students and Regents.

So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me.

But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side. They reached out, and helped me get my life together,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program didn’t just throw money at us and say “here, graduate.” They provided us with skills for the future, and people we can always go back to for help. The Promise Scholars Program helps students like me have a fighting chance in college, and be successful afterwards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen compared the feeling of being part of the first graduating class to the feeling of being the first in one’s family to graduate from college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of pride in being the first group to graduate, because–although this sounds dramatic–I feel like we paved the way for future Promise Scholars.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
