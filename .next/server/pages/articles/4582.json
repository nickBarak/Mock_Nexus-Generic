There was also debate of other local issues, particularly concerning I.V., such as discussion of ongoing maintenance and restoration efforts at Anisq’Oyo’ Park, updates on the current fence project initiated by the Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs and plans to potentially implement laws requiring all dogs in I.V. to be leashed.</p>\n<p>In regards to issues of street lighting, Soutar said civic groups have been seeking adequate funding to install more street lamps in the local community. According to Soutar, there is statistical evidence that additional lighting is necessary since much of I.V.’s crime is concentrated in more poorly lit areas.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get $100,000 to do lighting in Isla Vista, and this is going to be going before the Board of Supervisors,” Soutar said. “They did some crime statistics … between El Nido, Pasado, Del Playa, all the way to Camino Corto is the bulk of, you know, where the crime happens.”</p>\n<p>Although installation of new street lamps across Isla Vista would cost approximately $300,000, attaining this initial $100,000 grant would at least allow groups to install of lamps in the most crime-ridden portions of the community.</p>\n<p>In another attempt to make Isla Vista safer, IVRPD met with county officials at Walter Capps Park to receive final approval for the Associated Students EVPLA fence project.</p>\n<p>The Board also discussed progress on Anisq’Oyo’ Park’s pond maintenance and restoration, announcing that rebuilding plans for the park’s stage have been approved by the Planning and Development Department of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>General Manager of IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the park recently received flowers as a donation from Santa Barbara Water Garden.</p>\n<p>“[They] donated about one hundred water hyacinths, which are now split between the front and the back pond,” Gould said. “What those will do, they’ll help filter out a lot of the muck that’s in the water.”</p>\n<p>Lotusland also contributed to the pond’s restoration by donating 50 to 100 plants for growth in the enclosure, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Gould suggested the district of Isla Vista adopt a series of leash laws, similar to those of Santa Barbara County, in order to waive the district’s liability for off-leash dog attacks. Gould said until I.V. implements these policies, it will continue to be responsible for these incidents.</p>\n<p>“In the County of Santa Barbara, all of their parks have leash laws. They post a leash-free zone, and that sort of protects them a little bit,” Gould said. “In the meantime, we don’t have any protections. We don’t have leash laws in any of our parks.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD meetings are open to the public and held on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 4th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50452\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50452\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/local-safety-concerns-and-issues-discussed-at-latest-ivrpd-meeting/","id":4582,"author":{"id":204,"name":"Adam Courtin"},"related":[4581,4580,4579],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":204,"name":"Adam Courtin","biography":"Not available","articles":[3122,4582],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building to discuss potential forms of tenant mediation in I.V. if it becomes a Community Services District (CSD) in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>The group met with Andrea Bifano, representative of the Community Development Department Rental Housing Mediation of Santa Barbara County, to discuss further plans for mediation. UCSB students, who have access to mediation through the University, are currently the only I.V. residents with such services.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, who is running for Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor, stakeholders should consider the fact that UCSB students already have free mediation at their disposal.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tax money people are paying is to go towards this service that they are also getting from somewhere else,” Freeman said. “I don’t think we should fully discount them. The board will make a decision on who they want to serve. UCSB is not running this government.”</p>\n<p>Carlos Lopez, fourth-year anthropology major and A.S. Lobby Corps director, said he is interested in a new mediation program that would educate renters on how to communicate with landlords about property maintenance.</p>\n<p>“I think the ability to inform students on what their rights are when living in a house is good,” Lopez said. “There have been only a few situations when something might be going on in your house and you’re not sure if it’s your job or your landlord’s job to fix. For a lot of students who are only going to be living there for a year, it’s kind of easier to put up with it for a year.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said it is important for renters to uphold open communication with their landlords about what to do if a property needs maintenance.</p>\n<p>“Even in my house there was something wrong with our fence and one of our neighbors was talking about how when they called the landlord they got a way different response than when they went online to deal with the problem,” Lopez said. “So it’s good to establish some level of consistency in treatment on issues for tenants and the things that happen.”</p>\n<p>Audrey Tamayo, a member of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and third-year political science major, said the University mediation program does not always take into account the point of view of everyone in tenant-landlord mediations.</p>\n<p>“From my accounts with people that I know, the University’s program has not been as effective as they should,” Tamayo said. “Some of the problems include mediators twisting the words a bit, so in one instance where my friend and her roommate were having an argument and one of the tenants had pushed her up against the balcony, the mediator rephrased it as a push-shove fight. That implies a mutual kind of pushing and shoving, [but] it was only one tenant who was pushing.”</p>\n<p>According to Tamayo, many tenants, including her own housemates, fear going to the University for help with mediation because they believe it will end in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“I guess they are kind of scared in a way, since others are always saying that they’re going to sue you if you go do this,” Tamayo said.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus, said he appreciates that the program will provide safety for many tenants who oftentimes end up experiencing difficulty with legality.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate hearing the fact that it ultimately can result in a legally binding contract or document,” Abboud said. “A lot of the times, dealing with landlords and property managers, you might come up with a spoken agreement, but when it comes time to resolve it, there’s another thing that ends up happening.”</p>\n<p>The task force of mediators would be neutral between tenants and landlords, with discussions of creating workshops where all parties could come together to receive education on renting in I.V. The proposed tenant mediation would be incorporated into the eight percent Utility User’s Tax, which will be on the November 2016 ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/","id":4579,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4578,4577,4576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria To Reopen","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.</p>\n<p>According to the Babais, Gio’s closed temporarily to allow the new owners to transfer business and alcohol permits back to the location from previous owner Matt Metzka.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a public meeting to discuss finances and the surplus budget for a potential Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista, Tuesday evening in the I.V. Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Participants discussed the use of a $126,000 budget for committees and services outlined in Das William’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to make I.V., currently an unincorporated area, into a CSD. The selected services, which will be aided by a $200,000 pledge by UCSB after the CSD is created, will be sent to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for approval and placed on the 2016 ballot for voters to a decide on an eight percent utility users tax. The services to be sent to LAFCO are the Municipal Advisory Council, the Tenant Mediation Program, the Area Planning Commission, a parking district, police protection services, community facilities, sidewalks, lighting, gutters, trees and graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>George Thurlow, Alumni Affairs Office assistant vice chancellor, said although the pledged funds will not be available until after the CSD is created, it should still be included in the report to LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion would be that you come up with a wish list for two years, 2017 and 2018, a $200,000 budget for each one and decide which projects and programs you want to fund,” Thurlow said. “Put that in front of LAFCO because they’re going to be criticizing [that] it’s not enough money or good enough services.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus, said the term “police protection services” should be defined before deciding on an alternative community policing program that would cost $75,000.</p>\n<p>“To me, it could be contracting law enforcement to host a few self-defense classes every quarter,” Schunk said. “That to me is contracting for additional law enforcement services and that activates that power just fine, and we also have a contract.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said contracting more law enforcement officers from Santa Barbara County or UC Police Department (UCPD) would “tie” the CSD to the police collaborative board.</p>\n<p>“I just wonder whether or not contracting with them is getting actual on-the-job police services or contracting something small like liaison work,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Pargin, second-year math major, said it would be more beneficial to get additional police services from UCPD because it would come out of the university’s budget instead of the CSD’s budget.</p>\n<p>The collaborative program is based on the S.N.A.P. program at Cal Poly which hires students to be first responders and provide campus warnings. Since the university does not want to expand the CSO program into I.V., the contracting cadets would not be UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliot, community organizer from Das Williams’ office, said the CSD could replicate S.N.A.P., but will not be an extension of the program.</p>\n<p>“They could work with student groups with whatever project they’re working on,” Elliot said. “These cadets do not carry weapons and are in training to eventually become officers. It would be better because they would learn to respond without weapons and have training that didn’t incorporate immediate arresting.”</p>\n<p>Jonathon Abboud, Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus, said it would be best to fund as many services as possible through LAFCO’s approval and distribute $200,000 in UCSB pledge funds afterwards.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually better and more effective in the long term with the money we have instead of spreading the budget out way too thin where you couldn’t do that much per year,” Abboud said. “I think it’s a much more prudent approach to LAFCO where you’ve already thought of eight percent.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/","id":4581,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4580,4579,4578],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
