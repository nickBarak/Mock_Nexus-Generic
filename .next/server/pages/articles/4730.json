What seemed like a battle of defenses was broken open in the bottom of the eighth when freshman infielder Clay Fisher singled, then reached second off of an errant throw by Long Beach State’s freshman righty Chris Mathewson.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outfielder Andrew Calica advanced Fisher to third with a sacrifice bunt. Maris drove in Fisher as the tying run from a long double to center field.</p>\n<p>“I felt confident (during the eighth); I felt like I was going to do something for the team and it just happened,” Maris said.</p>\n<p>Maris accounted for the go-ahead run, coming home off a sacrifice fly RBI from junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic. Redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson and junior first baseman Dalton Kelly also accounted for two of the four total RBIs in Sunday’s game, all coming in the bottom of the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s close series came as an offensive halt as the Gauchos scored just seven runs against Long Beach compared to the teams’ past three-game streak of over 10 runs scored per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to continue to work offensively,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have to be more dynamic offensively and be able to adjust earlier in the game, and be able to handle pitchers who can throw off-speed pitches for strikes.”</p>\n<p>Defensively for the Gauchos on Sunday, sophomore righty Shane Bieber started on the mound and allowed only one run and eight hits through 7.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“I was frustrated with myself in the first inning because I made a lot of mistakes, but I was lucky to get out of there with one run,” Bieber said. “I just tried to keep my team in the ball game.”</p>\n<p>The team behind Bieber remained errorless for the second game in a row. Junior lefty Domenic Mazza was worked in for the win, coming in as a reliever for Bieber. For a change of pace, Nesovic entered the game in the ninth for a one-inning save.</p>\n<p>“I have the most confidence in those guys, as I have had in a defense in a long time, I have the ability to see the glove, throw to it, and they always make the plays,” Bieber said.</p>\n<p>Other starters this weekend were junior righty Dillon Tate on Friday and junior lefty Justin Jacome on Saturday. Both Tate and Jacome pitched a full nine innings.</p>\n<p>“[The pitching staff] had an excellent weekend,” Checketts said. “We had two excellent starts and one quality start. We’re feeling really good about our starting pitchers.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next series will be a four-game series starting Wednesday at 3 p.m. at home against Fresno State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61824\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/baseball-opens-big-west-on-positive-note/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61824\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/baseball-opens-big-west-on-positive-note/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/baseball-opens-big-west-on-positive-note/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/baseball-opens-big-west-on-positive-note/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-30/baseball-opens-big-west-on-positive-note/","id":4730,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4729,4728,4727],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Fresno State for Four-Game Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/StephanManga_Baseball_for03312015-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/StephanManga_Baseball_for03312015-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 15 UCSB looks to get back on track in a non-conference matchup against the Bulldogs.

Though holding a 14-4 at home record, Fresno is only 2-9 on the road.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This is a little bit irregular starting on Wednesday and playing a long series,” junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic said. “I’m confident and excited.”</p>\n<p>Coming off a loss on Friday against Long Beach State, junior starting pitcher Dillon Tate will take the mound this series recording 59 strikeouts and a 1.39 earned run average. Tate holds the second most number of strikeouts and second best ERA in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the end of the world, but sometimes [losses] happen. I know the guys have my back,” Tate said. “I just need to keep doing what I’m doing, and I know they’ll back me up.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching staff is up against a very hot and cold Fresno offense that is coming off a losing series against New Mexico, where it scored eight runs on Saturday and only one on Sunday. Before that, Fresno went on a five-game win streak against UCSB, San Jose and No. 21 Cal, where its lineup scored a total of 42 runs. The Bulldogs have scored at least six runs in their past seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about our starters. We need to get our bullpen guys in there, they didn’t get much work last weekend,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be high scoring or not, but I feel comfortable with our starters, but we need to work on minimizing their pitch count.”</p>\n<p>In a commanding spot of the Fresno lineup is junior catcher Taylor Ward who has accounted for 25 RBI this season. Ward currently holds a team high .359 batting average and a .485 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>“I think [the team is] going to be ready to go, and we learned a lot over this past weekend,” Checketts said. “We pitched great but we didn’t play great offense, but I think we’ll come in more prepared for this series than they were last weekend.”</p>\n<p>Though the Gaucho offense struggled for consistency in the previous Long Beach State series, UCSB still accounts for multiple offensive conference leaders. Nesovic tops the conference chart with 24 RBI this season and comes in at third for season batting average, as he hits for .372.</p>\n<p>“We need to be able to handle different types of pitchers,” Checketts said. “We’re going to try to give them some different looks in batting practice, and adjust based on style of pitching.”</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Cameron Newell comes in behind Nesovic for fifth in the conference with .347. On the base path, Leadoff hitter, redshirt sophomore Andrew Calica has had 10 stolen bases, the third most in Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB is also tied in the conference with UC Davis for overall team batting average with .298. Though UCSB falls slightly behind Davis in overall on-base percentage, the Gauchos lead the league in RBIs with 141 this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to have an away approach and focus on hitting the ball to the opposite side of the field,” Nesovic said. “I think we’ll do that fine this week.”</p>\n<p>The series against Fresno State will run from today through Saturday at home. This will be the last home series for the Gauchos until they return to Santa Barbara to face rival Cal Poly after a road-trip to play Cal State Northridge next weekend.</p>\n<p>Today’s game is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/gauchos-host-fresno-state-for-four-game-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/gauchos-host-fresno-state-for-four-game-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/gauchos-host-fresno-state-for-four-game-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/gauchos-host-fresno-state-for-four-game-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/gauchos-host-fresno-state-for-four-game-series/","id":4727,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4726,4725,4724],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Das Williams, I.V.

The series of events aims to provide students and I.V. residents the opportunity to learn how AB 3 could benefit the community and to advocate for I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 to the State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) with the ability to levy taxes to provide residents with improved local services and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the events are meant to motivate and inform students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s educational, and it’s also in the hopes of empowering people to do work surrounding AB 3, be involved in the process, to really engage with both the bill and the concept of self-governance,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the key to successfully advocating for AB 3 is to educate I.V. residents by canvassing door to door.</p>\n<p>“I really think it’s just getting the word out,” Dela Cruz said. “There’s no way that we can just mail something out and hope that everyone knows about this. You literally have to go and knock on doors and talk to people. So it’s more talking to them and having them engage in the conversation that we’re having.”</p>\n<p>Williams said community engagement will be key to ensuring the events over the next two weeks are successful.</p>\n<p>“This is the time to show the Legislature that local support exists for AB 3, a bill which will create a community services district to meet the specific and unique needs of Isla Vista,” Williams said in an email. “Having backing from the County of Santa Barbara and surrounding cities is crucial to show the need for more direct government in this area.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 supporters being present at this week’s meetings and next week in Sacramento will be key to the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>“Bottom line is we need Isla Vista community members to rally together and be heard in the Legislature,” Williams said in an email. “Their presence is critical to ensure passing of this bill. Their voices need to be heard. They know the challenges first-hand and can serve as a strong force to move this bill successfully through the legislative process.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said AB 3 is unique piece of legislation because it was developed through I.V. stakeholders’ collective efforts.</p>\n<p>“Usually, legislation kind of just comes from Sacramento,” Schunk said. “To the contrary, Das Williams and his office have really kind of stepped up to the plate and done what I think is an outstanding job of really engaging the community.”</p>\n<p>Williams and the Initiative are asking for increased community involvement because of the bill’s importance to the I.V. self-governance movement, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“This bill is so monumental, so it deserves extra attention,” Schunk said. “Every resident of Isla Vista will somehow be impacted by this, so I think it’s critical that we try and hear from as many voices as possible.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he hopes to see a significant number of supporters turn out for the County Legislative Committee, Goleta City Council and LAFCO meetings, he has realistic expectations.</p>\n<p>“I would like to see at least 10 people at each of those meetings, and I don’t think that’s going to be outlandish,” Schunk said. “The more voices that are heard by these different entities, the more they realize that there is a broad and diverse backing for this movement.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he knows Associated Students will have a significant presence at the AB 3 events, but believes there will also be a strong turn out from non-A.S. students.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, I do expect a lot of A.S. members to be there, because those are typically the people who are politically engaged,” Schunk said. “I also do think that we’ve gotten quite a few students both from SBCC and from UCSB who are not involved in student government.”</p>\n<p>According to Dela Cruz, the series of events aims to also include non-student residents and Latino families who are not as involved in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“We had canvassing for the Family Fun Day … where we had volunteers to help us canvas, and just talked to the community,” Dela Cruz said. “Specifically, families for the Family Fun Day geared towards Isla Vista long-term residents and Latino families who don’t often come to our weekly AB 3 meetings on Tuesdays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the goal of the AB 3 events is to show Sacramento legislators there is broad local support for the bill.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we are seeking endorsements from the County and Goleta as well as the residents of I.V. itself, getting people to every event is going to be challenge due to the meetings being scheduled during work/school hours and out of our control,” Abboud said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

After going 18-straight innings with only three runs and 16 hits, the team kicked off its early momentum with a three-run homer from sophomore second baseman JaVon Shelby. Kentucky continued to capitalize for 12 runs in 13 hits and by the end of the day had improved its team batting average for the season to .316.</p>\n<p>“In college baseball, when you put up crooked numbers, it’s hard to come back,” RS senior second baseman Woody Woodward said. “Maybe we will tip our caps and just say they capitalized. SEC has some big boppers. They make contact, put some runs up and they capitalized on errors.”</p>\n<p>On the Gaucho side of the ball, UCSB did not let up as Kentucky continued to drive ahead. The team went for 13 hits as well, but drove in for only seven runs. Woodward topped the team in RBIs in Sunday’s game, driving in two while going 2-3 at the plate. Woodward has maintained a .385 on-base percentage through this season so far.</p>\n<p>“We got down early and we wanted to stay in the middle and keep the ball on the ground. That’s where a lot of the RBIs are,” Woodward said. “We wanted to scratch our way back.”</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s shutout, junior righty Dillon Tate stepped up to the mound again for his second start this season. Tate allowed no runs and four hits through seven innings pitched with no strikeouts and only two walks.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the game in the hands of freshman righty reliever Chris Clements in his first Gaucho appearance, as he allowed one hit in one inning pitched and one strikeout.</p>\n<p>“[The shutout] is a testament to how good Dillon Tate’s stuff is against a good offensive team,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Offensively, junior first baseman Dalton Kelly had a leader-board game at the plate, driving in five runs with a two-RBI double in the third and a three-RBI triple in the seventh while going 2-4 and accounting for two runs himself.</p>\n<p>Friday’s game set the tone for a winning series, as the Gaucho lineup rocked Kentucky’s ace, junior righty Kyle Cody, to allow seven runs in only three innings pitched, forcing the Wildcats to bring in bullpen backup early in the game. Kentucky played four pitchers in total.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ junior leftfielder Cameron Newell stepped up at bat in Friday’s game, going 3-4 and knocking in three RBIs.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s sophomore right-handed pitcher Shane Bieber had his second start on Friday night. In eight innings pitched, he held Kentucky’s big hitters to only nine hits for two runs before he turned over the ninth inning to freshmen Alex Garcia to finish the game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take [Sunday’s] game and move forward, but I feel good and I like our team,” Woodward said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is scheduled to play a one-game visit against Pepperdine next, in the team’s first away game of the season on Tuesday in Malibu at 2:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/61252/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/61252/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/61252/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/61252/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/61252/","id":4729,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4728,4727,4726],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
