Halfway through his third year as a Gaucho, Kingi is putting his experience to work, recording team high statistics and making improvements in all aspects of his game.</p>\n<p>“This year I just realized I need to hit harder, pass better, focus more and lead by example because I am not the most outspoken player on the team,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>Until last week, Kingi was consistently leading the UCSB men’s volleyball team in kills for the entire first half of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Austin has really embraced his role as a primary passer and go-to attacker this season,” Assistant Coach Cullen Irons said. “He is a lead by example kind of player.”</p>\n<p>It is apparent Kingi has seized this opportunity as a go-to player, already dishing out three double-double performances against Hawaii, Pepperdine and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“My first two years here I would say I was pretty consistent, but I was more of a role player … I wasn’t a standout, or I wasn’t leading the team in kills,” Kingi said.</p>\n<p>In this season alone, the circumstances have changed and Kingi’s offensive consistency and overall improvement is standing out above the rest.</p>\n<p>Kingi describes volleyball as something that has always been an important part of his life. He began playing organized volleyball in the seventh grade, but has been exposed to it through his parents for as long as he can remember.</p>\n<p>This family’s involvement doesn’t stop there. The UCSB men’s volleyball team boasts not one, but two Kingi brothers who are currently in the starting lineup. Austin is one of the outside hitters on the team and his older brother Chad Kingi is a senior libero.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to compare because his position is more of the passing,” Kingi said. “But when I am playing with Chad, we definitely have some chemistry on the court.”</p>\n<p>Not only do the brothers play on the same team, but they also live together. One might think they would be sick of each other, but Austin said they have become a lot closer in this past year. Austin lists his older brother’s influence as one of the main reasons he decided to become a Gaucho in the first place.</p>\n<p>“A part of my decision to come to UCSB was because of Chad, and I had also grown up going to basketball tournaments on this campus so I was familiar with it,” Kingi said. “Another reason is because it was a UC school, and that was a better opportunity than Long Beach and University of Hawaii which were also recruiting me.”</p>\n<p>Austin said although he considered the other options, UCSB was always the right choice, and it was close enough to his family at home. In addition to having his brother on the court with him, he has a supportive fan base in the bleachers as well.</p>\n<p>“The whole Kingi family is very tight knit around their volleyball,” Austin’s roommate Lucas Steagall said. “It’s pretty cool actually, they are all very into the sport.”</p>\n<p>At just about any game, home or away, you can find the Kingi parents and grandparents decked out in Gaucho blue supporting their boys. Austin said that his grandparents love coming to the games so much they keep a second house in Thousand Oaks especially for volleyball season.</p>\n<p>“It has been really fun because my parents are able to see both of us, they don’t have to choose a team,” Kingi said. “My grandparents are also really supportive, they are at almost every game with my parents.”</p>\n<p>Other than following in his brother’s footsteps, Austin’s love for the beach made his decision to come to UCSB that much easier. When he isn’t busy with practice and school, he says kayaking is one of his favorite things to do. He also loves playing tennis and says that he recently started playing racquetball with his brother Chad.</p>\n<p>“I love tennis, I really just like to try everything,” Kingi said. “Chad just got me my own racquet, so we are going to go and play racquetball together sometime soon.”</p>\n<p>Kingi’s desire to try new things is directly related to his future career choice. He is currently majoring in Film and Media Studies and hopes to work on something involved in movie production later in life.</p>\n<p>“I want to experience as many things as I can. I am hoping to do some internships, and figure out what I like before working under someone,” Kingi said. “Once I get through some more classes I am sure I will have a better idea of the direction I want to go.”</p>\n<p>When asked if he had any interest in furthering his volleyball career, and possibly going overseas to play professionally, Kingi said he might consider it for the opportunity to travel.</p>\n<p>“I think about it, I would consider it for a few years to travel the world,” Kingi said. “But production is the end goal.”</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the rest of the season, Kingi has strong goals for both himself and for the team.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning of this season we all talked about how we want the national championship this year. I think this year especially since everyone is older it seems much more attainable,” said Kingi. “I have similar goals for myself, but I am just working to improve my role as a leader on the team, and leading by example.”</p>\n<p>With a tough game tonight against UCLA, Kingi’s role as a consistent offensive threat will be especially important. Kingi has already recorded 158 kills and 13 service aces in half a season. With plenty of games ahead, he is already approaching the 224 kills and 20 service aces that he earned in the entirety of the 2013 season.</p>\n<p>Austin Kingi is truly a product of his support system. Whether it is through his parents traveling to Palo Alto to cheer him on against Stanford, or his team looking to him in critical moments to lead by example, he is being surrounded by all angles and answering back with an incredible season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 5, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by

In addition, sophomore middle blocker Allie Sullberg had seven block assists andsophomore middle blocker Phoebe Grunt had six block assists.</p>\n<p>For the Titans, sophomore libero McKenna Painton and freshman outside hitter/middle blocker Niki Withers led offensively with 14 and 16 kills, respectively.</p>\n<p>On the other side of UCSB’s split weekend was its 3-2, fifth-set decision loss to UC Irvine. The Gauchos battled Irvine back and forth throughout the five sets, but ultimately fell to the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“Friday night we should have won,” Barbeau said. “[Irvine’s] defense was outstanding and we just couldn’t offensively put a ball away. We couldn’t execute.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos beat Irvine in the first set 25-23. With an accurate, offensive edge behind the ball, UCSB hit for a .324 average compared to Irvine’s .256.</p>\n<p>Fighting back in the second set, Irvine rallied to win 25-23, totaling 17 kills to UCSB’s nine. Irvine kept this momentum going through the third set, as the team held the Gauchos to eight kills and 32 total attempts, while still hitting for 16 kills. The Anteaters had only two errors on their way to a 25-14 win.</p>\n<p>Tides changed back towards the Gauchos direction in the fourth set, as the team came back for a 25-22 win, hitting for a .268 average and holding Irvine to 11 kills.</p>\n<p>However, as the match led into the fifth set, Irvine regained the lead on its home court, ending the match on a 15-9 win.</p>\n<p>Offensively for the Gauchos, Barbeau, and junior opposite Jaylen Villanueva each had 14 overall kills in the match. Defensively, Spindt had 19 of the team’s 76 total digs, 12 of which also went to senior setter Ali Santi.</p>\n<p>For the opposing side, junior outside hitter Marisa Bubica hit 19 kills against the Gauchos and senior outside hitter Allison Lee held up the Anteater defense with 24 total digs.</p>\n<p>“[The season] is going pretty well. We are still trying to find that consistency against all the teams that we play, but we’re on the up,” Spindt said.</p>\n<p>UCSB return home to play in the Thunderdome this upcoming weekend to play Long Beach State on Friday at 7 p.m. and Cal State Northridge on Saturday also at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-volleyball-4/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-volleyball-4/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-volleyball-4/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-volleyball-4/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-volleyball-4/","id":5214,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[5213,5212,5211],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 8 Gauchos Have Record-Setting Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 8 UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo team had an eventful weekend, losing its first game of the season to UC Irvine before winning three in a row at the Inland Empire Classic to improve its r...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 8 UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo team had an eventful weekend, losing its first game of the season to UC Irvine before winning three in a row at the Inland Empire Classic to improve its record to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>In the team’s latest win on Sunday, the Gauchos destroyed Chapman by an impressive score of 32-6, making it a memorable win for multiple reasons.

The first time the teams met was back in February in UCSB’s first game of the Triton Invitational in San Diego. It resulted in a 5-2 defeat for the Gauchos, their only loss in the four games they played in the tournament. Their second match came just two weeks ago, when Santa Barbara traveled to Long Beach and handed the 49ers an 8-7 loss.</p>\n<p>“We’ve learned not to overlook them,” senior utility Christie Clark said. “They’re a tough team. We’ve been practicing all week for them and we’re anxious to show them how much we’ve improved.”</p>\n<p>The winner of this year’s tournament will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Every team in the conference will be battling for that bid, and with the level of talent that the conference features, no team is going to have an easy road.</p>\n<p>“Every team has a chance to win,” Wigo said. “We’re going to be fighting for every win. Everyone has [the automatic bid] in mind.”</p>\n<p>In order to get through the tournament, the Gauchos will need the entire team to play like it was playing in the season’s second half. Prior to March 4, the Gauchos posted a mediocre 10-7 record. But starting with a 14-6 beatdown of St. Francis that day, the Gauchos posted a 10-4 record. Over that period, the Gaucho defense stepped up its play significantly, allowing double-digit goals just twice and holding their opponents to five goals each time.</p>\n<p>“As long as all the girls have their heads in the game and we go for the win in every single one, we have the ability to win them all,” senior utility Kathryn Nelson said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to a handful of stars to lead the charge. Nelson, who led the team with 37 steals and 11 field blocks this season, is a key figure on defense. Anchoring the goal behind her will be sophomore Ruth Milne, who started all 30 contests this year, led the conference with an average of 12 saves per game and tallied 289 total saves, surpassing her own single-season school record of 275 from last year.</p>\n<p>Nelson, along with senior utility Claire Buchanan, combined for 92 goals to lead the Gauchos’ scoring attack. Buchanan also ended the season on a 10-game goal streak, scoring 21 times. Clark, who finished third in scoring with 29 goals and is currently fourth on UCSB’s all time scoring list with 145, will also be a factor.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’re playing really well,” Wigo said. “All of our key players have been playing great and we’re playing at home, so we definitely have some things going for us.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine, the defending conference champions, received the top seed and a first round bye. The winner of Pacific and UC Davis’ match, which begins today at 3:30 p.m., will meet Irvine at the same time on Saturday. The Gauchos will take to the pool to face off with Long Beach at 5:15 p.m., with the winner playing second-seeded CSU Northridge at 5:15 p.m. on Saturday. All matches will be held in Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37403\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37403\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/","id":5216,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5215,5214,5213],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
