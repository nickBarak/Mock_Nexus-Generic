During the march, over 100 demonstrators walked from Little Acorn Park to Del Playa, then proceeded to walk up and down Del Playa chanting “End rape culture!” and “Consent is an enthusiastic yes!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment. – Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund said Bhavnani, who is also Chair of the Academic Senate, prompted her students to organize an event that addressed what they felt were the most prevalent issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Immediately, rape culture surfaced as the biggest issue for all of us. Professor Bhavnani prompted us a little and we decided to do something about it,” said Westerlund. “The rest is history.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger, event participants felt that Friday’s demonstration was vital in order to bring attention to what many students see as an increase of sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was rewarding to be able to say publicly that there are actually people who care about this problem [and] so many people who know it’s unacceptable,” Ballinger said. “In a community where rape happens all the time, we don’t get a chances to say that enough.”</p>\n<p>Westerlund said the event helped shed light on issues regarding safety for women in I.V. and that turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations by amassing twice predicted amount of attendees.</p>\n<p>“I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment,” Westerlund said. “The fact that this happens in Isla Vista makes this event really relevant to our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59842\" data-attachment-id=\"59842\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59842 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Participants walked the one-mile stretch while holding posters and passing out flyers that read “No excuse for rape. End rape culture.” According to Westerlund, event organizers intentionally staged the march on Del Playa in order to bring attention to sexual assault in an area that has historically typified what many students see as the party culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We planned the walk for DP on a Friday night in order to reach the target audience,” Westerlund said. “DP is always filled with students, often intoxicated, looking or headed towards a party. This group is especially at risk of rape, sexual assault or harassment. We wanted to bring the problem to light in its own arena.”</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, many students and I.V. residents cheered and clapped from their Del Playa balconies, high-fived participants or took videos of the passing crowd.</p>\n<p>Organizers invited students to participate in the demonstration via Facebook in order to facilitate discussion on rape culture in I.V., third-year sociology major and event coordinator Zoe Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>“This is an interactive event to help make known that there does exist in Isla Vista a rape culture and this we hope will provide a space where students can comfortably confront rape culture,” Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.]. To end the, ‘Well what was she wearing?’ and ‘Was she drunk?’ questions, and to end the society that makes these questions okay. – Third-year global studies major Claire Breen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Patrice Trowbridge said gender roles in I.V. play a large part in shaping the presence of rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“To me rape culture is every person that feels entitled to sex and every person that feels obligated to give it. And that’s so pervasive in I.V. The way we look at gender leads to rape but people don’t see that,” Trowbridge said. “Hopefully if we make it hard to ignore it will start some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Jonathan Gonzalez, a fourth-year political science major and Vice President of Sigma Lambda Beta fraternity’s local chapter, rape is just as much a male issue as it is a female issue and should be addressed equally by both sexes.</p>\n<p>“Instead of teaching girls to be careful and to watch their backs, we should be teaching the boys to not rape. Our current generation is the next generation of parents so it’s up to us to get educated and educate our boys and girls,” said Gonzalez. “Boys and girls were stopping their normal weekend partying to cheer and chant with us.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity member Carlos Maldonado said rape culture is a topic that needs to be given immediate attention, especially within organizations that face controversy regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a fraternity member, it is essential to be present at these important events so that we may raise awareness and establish accountability within our own organizations so that we do not perpetuate this culture,” said Maldonado.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59843\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59843\" data-attachment-id=\"59843\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59843\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=253%2C168\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major Claire Breen, event attendees marched in order to empower others to participate in the local and nationwide movement toward ending rape culture.</p>\n<p>“I think that rape culture is horrifically prevalent not only in Isla Vista, but on all college campuses in the United States,” said Breen. “I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.].

Tuesday night in a candle-lit memorial titled “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends.”</p>\n<p>The third annual memorial walk organized by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends” aimed to bring attention to victims of alcohol and drug abuse-related incidents, as well as to commemorate the victims of last May’s I.V. shooting. Due to rainy weather, memorial attendees walked through I.V. streets in coats, jackets and umbrellas.</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Education and Outreach Coordinator Marjan Riazi said the event was created in order to provide an opportunity for students to support each other through common experiences of loss.</p>\n<p>“This event is for students and community members who want to come together within a community of support to grieve and process their loss and experience,” Riazi said, “especially this year, as we additionally remember victims of the Isla Vista Tragedy.”</p>\n<p>The memorial walk also aimed to address the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse in I.V., specifically seeking to warn against “synergy,” or mixing alcohol with other drugs, which Riazi said is a persistent health issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Synergy, which has caused a number of deaths in Isla Vista, is prevalent within our community,” Riazi said. “It’s crucial for our students to be aware of the dangers of mixing alcohol and other drugs.”</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said the memorial walk, along with other community-building efforts in I.V. and on campus, has played a significant role in helping to mend the I.V. and campus community in wake of recent unrest and tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We have taken this opportunity to just come together to remember students and community members we have lost,” Kurta said. “This year of course is especially powerful for all of us, we wanted to open this up to the larger community.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos for Recovery peer Nina Taylor said the walk had personal significance to her, as alcohol and drug issues are something that effect an extensive number of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m here is not only to support my community. This also touches base with some of the things I experience weekly with students that come and see us in our recovery program,” said Taylor. “I know a lot of people struggle and have had friends or family who have struggled with alcohol and drugs and as a result have injured themselves or lost their lives.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year anthropology major Brian Lee said the walk helped spur I.V. recovery from the May 23 tragedy and other common grievances experienced by students and I.V. residents last school year.</p>\n<p>“Ever since the shooting last year, it’s been really hard to recover as a community,” Lee said, “I thought tonight was a great way to just come together in peace and reminisce.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/","id":4802,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4801,4800,4799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss I.V.

Self-Governance Bill. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students met in the Associated Students Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) yesterday to discuss different services that could be helpful to Isla Vista and to develop clearer goals for CA state Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill for I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) seeks to create a Community Services District (CSD) governance for I.V. which would empower a local governmental board exclusive to I.V. to authorize and execute services and infrastructure projects for the area using locally sourced revenues. Williams’ office is facilitating multiple discussions with different stakeholders, with today’s discussion focusing on capturing student perspectives on what type of services they want in I.V.</p>\n<p>Other issues discussed at the meeting included the role of housing and utility taxes to pay for services, creating a community center and “safe space” in I.V., altering community policing and creating bicycle lanes on the streets.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he thinks that while specific services like a community center or underground facilities could be helpful in I.V., it is important to focus on the long term future and explore how a CSD will be sustained moving forward.</p>\n<p>“For me, the big picture here is [that] even if I think it’s a realistic approach, we’re not going to get all these services at one time. There just isn’t enough money in the world for that,” Schunk said. “But what we can do is prioritize a few and say that these are the most important to us and from there what we can do is really create a system that will benefit those in the long term.”</p>\n<p>One of the concerns raised at a prior stakeholder’s meeting last week was that AB3 was coming from Williams and his office without enough contribution from students and other I.V. residents.<br>\nBut according to Ashley Kruzel, a State Assembly field representative for Williams, since Williams’ office is facilitating the bill and because it has to go through the legislative process, it must come from Williams’ office or CA state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s office, as she represents Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Das can introduce a bill, I can’t introduce a bill, you can’t,” Kruzel said, “It has to come from Das or Hannah-Beth because obviously no one else gives a shit about Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>During the forum at the MCC, Schunk discussed the potential of implementing utility taxes in a future CSD-type of self-governance for I.V. as opposed to implementing a property tax. With a utilities tax, I.V. residents would be able to see exactly what they are being charged for instead of unknowingly increasing the overall cost of living without transparency, Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“I think that for a lot of people [a utilities tax] will provide that transparency that people are looking for and I think that a lot of people would desire [it] as opposed to property tax that may be a little bit more elusive,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>EVPLA office member and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she wants to convince students that these taxes could be beneficial in the long run.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s really important, because how are we going to tell students, ‘This is what’s going on. Self-governance is going on and your utilities are going to go up,’ plus tuition’s going up,” Melgoza said, “so we just have to find an effective way of making them see like, this is going to help long-term.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he believes students should consider the perspectives and needs of long-term residents when thinking about changes to the community.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s a lot of antagonism between students and long-term residents and I just want to remind everyone … that they are people, that they have lives and families like you, that they have hopes and dreams like you do,” Schunk said. “The one thing I want to encourage everyone to do is try to see them as people and try as hard as you can to really connect with them on a human level because you’d be amazed at how similarly they see this place to you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said that having an open discussion on self-governance with every constituent of I.V. is vital to ensuring optimum success with the proposed bill.</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing though is that we don’t let this become a students versus others kind of debate,” Schunk said. “I think moving forward, if students can keep in mind, that we owe it to this community to be members of the community. Then I think we’ll have much better dialogue also.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/","id":4803,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[4802,4801,4800],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Plan DP March Against Rape Culture","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NexuslogoBLUE1-310x232.jpg?resize=310%2C232&ssl=1","description":"Chair of the Academic Senate and Sociology Professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani, along with four students from her Introduction to Women, Culture, and Development (SOC156A) class, plan to march up and down Del ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Chair of the Academic Senate and Sociology Professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani along with four students from her Introduction to Women, Culture, and Development (SOC156A) class plan to march up and down Del Playa Drive Friday night to bring attention to rape culture in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Participants will begin marching from Acorn Park at 10 p.m., are encouraged to wear “party clothes” and will be given posters and signs with slogans made specifically for the event. The walk aims to address issues regarding sexual assault and gender stereotypes in I.V.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major and event organizer Diana Figueroa said the event idea first came about when Bhavnani invited students from her SOC156A class to discuss issues regarding I.V. with her over dinner.</p>\n<p>“We were like ‘You know what? It would be cool if we had a march to show people in I.V. who are in the party scene that rape culture exists,’” Figueroa said.</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, the main goal of the march is to draw attention to sexual violence, especially against women, and its prevalence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We really want people to start the conversation, but we don’t only want discussion, we want action,” Figueroa said. “We want other people to make a stand and do something about it … We want this event to start a catalyst of other events about rape culture and see this issue gain more attention.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Akshaya Natarajan said she is looking forward to participating in the march and thinks it is vital to shed light on cultural practices in I.V. that promote— instead of combat — instances of sexual violence or harassment.</p>\n<p>“As a first year, I don’t have much experience with people and the direct effects of rape culture, but it’s easy to see the direct effects with people using rape as a slang term and unnecessarily catcalling women in the street,” Natarajan said. “I think the march on DP is really cool and I’m excited to go.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators plan to march on Friday at 10 p.m., when parties typically occur and when Del Playa is generally crowded, in order to make a statement that aims to strongly impact students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Rape happens more commonly during parties where people are intoxicated, and marching on Del Playa, where the most amount of parties occur with the highest amount of people, will be confronting the problem where it happens most,” Figueroa said. “It will be spreading the message to everyone that this stuff happens and it can happen to anyone partying out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, marching on Del Playa will send a powerful message to students and I.V. residents occupying parties on the oft-crowded streets Friday night.</p>\n<p>“I think that they’re doing that on DP on a Friday night will really have a lasting effect,” Natarajan said. “It’s a bunch of people walking together, making a stance and calling people out who participate in rape culture. I don’t know how it will turn out — there’s always risks walking in a big group on DP, but I think it will be powerful one way or another. ”</p>\n<p>Figueroa said she expects to have a couple hundred people attend, however according to her the significance of the event should not be measured by how many people participate, but rather by the march’s impact on students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really matter how many people walk with us so long as people see us and see what we’re standing for and what we’re talking about,” Figueroa said. “And this hopefully starts dialogue among other people while they’re out partying and remind them that this stuff happens when people do party.”</p>\n<p>According to Figueroa, fear of sexual assault or harassment should not be an issue in I.V., as individuals should feel secure in their neighborhood.</p>\n<p>“I think at the end of the day, we just want women to feel safe going out,” Figueroa said. “We want men to realize that they play an important role in rape culture and that we need their help in ending rape culture as well. Unfortunately it exists and we have to teach people not to rape and warn women about the dangers of going out and dressing a certain way. It shouldn’t be an issue.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and a second-year physics major Liam Stanton said it is “incredibly important” that issues regarding sexual violence and harassment are addressed by “everyone in the UCSB and Isla Vista community, male, female, or otherwise.”</p>\n<p>“As a Senator, I particularly view it as one of my first responsibilities to support any movement seeking to combat rape culture and its implications in society, especially given the events which have historically plagued our community,” Stanton said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, students are ultimately responsible for stopping the abuses associated with rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture starts and ends with the students,” Natarajan said. “UCSB can implement all the rules they want but there’s still an underlying problem, and we need to make a stand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/students-plan-dp-march-against-rape-culture/","id":4804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4803,4802,4801],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
