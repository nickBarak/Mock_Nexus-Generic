To some extent, their calls seem to have been heard.</p>\n<p>Hannah-Beth Jackson, Santa Barbara’s state senator representing California’s 19th district and author of SB 1346, optimistically expressed approval for the new gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Although these laws encompass the entire state, UCSB’s past experience with gun violence oftentimes compels many local leaders and students to be more vocal about their opinions on the issue of gun control.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, a violent attack in I.V. left six people dead. Half died due to gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB] students will support these laws by being reminded that we need to do more — this will give them an incentive to call for more action, particularly at the federal level to combat gun violence,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Combating gun violence has been an ongoing initiative in California, highlighted by legislative action taken by former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>\n<p>While Gov. Brown did sign some bills addressing gun control, he also vetoed a number of them, some of which could have reduced the number of guns in the state, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>In the context of gun control, Jackson has high expectations for Gov. Newsom.</p>\n<p>“I expect him to be very supportive of policies that help reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes her bump-stock bill, SB 1346, will have an impact in reducing gun violence by prohibiting access to bump stocks in California and will hopefully reduce the number of gun deaths in the state.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see that our representative Hannah Beth Jackson introduced SB 1346,” Jeike Meijer, Associated Students (A.S.) executive vice president of local affairs, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Meijer spoke at the vigil for the 11 lives lost in a Pittsburgh synagogue due to gun violence and then again at the vigil in remembrance of the Thousand Oaks shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Both mass shootings occurred in November.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll see the rest of the country follow California soon,” Meijer added.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, A.S. president, believes the new legislation will be effective.</p>\n<p>“[Gun violence] is always on people’s minds, on prospective students’ minds, and I think that these kinds of measures are exactly what we need to have students feel more comfortable and safe in Isla Vista,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Kopel believes that SB 1100 specifically, which raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a firearm, would make UCSB students more comfortable “knowing that the people around them can’t even purchase a firearm.”</p>\n<p>“Even though most of the students that are attending this university now weren’t here to experience the 2014 shooting, that legacy does live on through vigils and remembrances,” Kopel added.</p>\n<p>Still, Kopel finds that more work needs to be done and believes that a “cultural change” regarding guns is needed in the United States.</p>\n<div

done.</p>\n<p>Limón is specifically looking forward to the potential impacts of AB 3129, which imposes a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>“I am especially hopeful that AB 3129… will make an impact in reducing the rate of women and children who die at the hands of repeat domestic abusers,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, believes that California serves as a model for the rest of the country when it comes to gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of Isla Vista, I feel like my voice has been heard and that our calls for reducing the amount of gun violence in this country are actually being taken seriously,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While Brandt believes that California is an effective leader on gun control legislation, he does not think the federal government has been adequately following California’s lead.</p>\n<p>“The national government, under the Republican Party, has decided that they’re going to pretend like they can ignore this issue and it’ll just go away,” Brandt said. “I think that that philosophy is something that has never worked out well and never been viewed well by history.”</p>\n<p>“The federal government used to look to California as a model, because these are the sorts of bills that should be implemented nationally.”</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said that he’s fighting for just that: he wants pieces of California gun control legislation to be laws of the nation.</p>\n<p>Carbajal plans to reintroduce the Gun Violence Restraining Act in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>“[The Gun Violence Restraining Act] allows family members, when they come across a loved one that seems to be, through their behavior, posing a danger to themselves or others… to work with law enforcement, officials and the court system to temporarily take guns away from [that individual],” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually similar to the one that California has in place that was enacted after the tragedy that happened in Isla Vista and UCSB, so it’s duplicating a similar law that exists in California.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes that the new California gun control legislation will enhance gun safety in California, and says he is “working to introduce similar legislation and be part of similar legislation introduced here in the House of Representatives.”</p>\n<p>“Far too many lives continue to be taken due to unnecessary gun use,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we are passing banning assault weapons, that we are banning high capacity magazines and that we move forward with universal background checks and the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Jan. 17, 12:11 p.m.]: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that most of the individuals killed in the I.V. attack died of gunshot wounds.

I really enjoyed that model, and I thought how could we get even better at this and understand the needs of the community better and model our policing to the needs of the community,” he said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>In the past year since Schroeder has been stationed at IVFP, he said he has experienced the ins and outs of I.V.’s unique community and its functioning.</p>\n<p>“I really saw the interaction between our department, law enforcement and the community members out in Isla Vista and saw how the way we interact really impacts how we enforce the law,” he said.</p>\n<p>One project he wants to bring to I.V. is the Citizen’s Academy, which is a two- to eight-week program about law enforcement that gives insight behind what police do and why.</p>\n<p>“A lot of stuff we do, the citizens don’t know why we do it. It’s tactically sound for us, it’s the way we’ve been trained, but the community doesn’t understand it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said his goal is to identify needs in the community by bringing programs. He is already working with I.V. Tenants Union, I.V. Youth Projects and UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students to identify areas that require change.</p>\n<p>Schroeder already started several programs since his appointment as CRD less than a month ago, some of which are pilot programs meant to gauge the response of the community.</p>\n<p>One such project is the party registration program, which allows residents of I.V. to notify law enforcement when they are hosting large parties. Deputies will then send a text to the hosts to alert them if they have received any noise complaints.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything like that. All we get is a large party and now we have to try to find a resident and we shut the party down because we can’t find anyone who lives there,” Schroeder said.</p>\n<p>“If we were to send a simple text message, maybe the party would quiet down a little bit.”</p>\n<p>He also wants to implement a diversion program for citations in I.V. Through this program, people who have received tickets for a noise or alcohol violation can attend an educational program and do community service as an alternative to paying fines.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said it would be more beneficial to educate the public rather than punish them and students who cannot afford to pay a hefty fine.</p>\n<p>He also brought up a program designed to educate people on how to react and respond to an active shooter situation. The current program in place is located in Goleta but is also in the works in I.V.</p>\n<p>Schroeder works closely with UC Police Department as well in his position. He is currently working alongside Matt Bowman, community and relations training lieutenant, and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">Kovena Avila</a>, I.V.’s new interpersonal violence detective.</p>\n<p>This collaborative effort brings forth several programs, such as town hall meetings for fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>Schroeder emphasized the importance of town hall meetings, as they cover a wide range of topics in I.V. from sexual assault, how to act if pulled over by police or what to do if an individual is caught with an open container.</p>\n<p>Schroeder urges residents of I.V. to contact him with any issues they might have.</p>\n<p>“Bring me what’s bothering you because I don’t know what’s bothering people out there. Sometimes people are a little shy or reserved about telling me. They’ll go to a party or they’ll go home and complain about it to their friends, but we never receive that complaint,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I just want to open up that line of communication and really bring any issues at all to me, and I’ll do my best to address it.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Schroeder can be found at the foot patrol station, located on 6504 Trigo Road in I.V.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Act – signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016 and implemented Jan. 2017 – requires local law enforcement to inform undocumented immigrants of requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) to speak with them.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Brown emphasized during the forum that the prison release dates were public in accordance with state law and are accessible to members of the public, and I.C.E., only if the resident’s name is known.</p>\n<p>He also said that the release dates were public so that residents would be able to know when someone who had committed a crime against them would be out of jail.</p>\n<p>Brown reported that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) released 15,241 inmates in the 2017 calendar year, and I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release dates of 526 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. then picked up 351 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>In Oct. 2017, Governor Brown passed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">Senate Bill 54</a>, which restricted the authority of I.C.E. in regards to local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[SB 54] curtails the use of state or local resources from engaging in immigration enforcement, effective in 2018, subject to a number of exemptions,” Sheriff Brown said during Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 30, 2018, SBSO released 11,551 inmates. I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release of 390 of those inmates and then picked up 74 of those.</p>\n<p>SB 54’s passage led immigration officials to spend more time out in the streets, Brown said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of relying primarily on taking inmates from the county jail, they now have started to conduct field operations,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>“[I.C.E.] may be after someone who is a criminal offender, but if that person has other people with them, [and] they determine that those people are undocumented aliens, then oftentimes they will [arrest them as well].”</p>\n<p>Brown noted that this has only created more fear within Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Most immigrants who are in our county, be they documented or undocumented, are good, hardworking people who are otherwise law-abiding. But it’s naive to think that every one of them is like that,” Brown said during the forum.</p>\n<p>“The reality has shown that we have had some very significant crimes committed in our community by people who are illegal aliens. There should be a common desire for everyone to see that people who commit such crimes are members of gangs or who are predisposed to violence for a serious crime, to be removed from our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85330\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85330\" data-attachment-id=\"85330\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/sbc-residents-demand-police-end-cooperation-with-i-c-e-during-annual-t-r-u-t-h-act-forum/img_4008/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4008\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85330\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several Santa Barbara County residents showed up to the forum to protest SBSO’s cooperation with I.C.E. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Numerous residents from Santa Barbara County spoke out against the actions of the local law enforcement during the public forum, demanding an end to the provision of prison release dates to I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Present among the speakers was Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Interim General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who, along with several I.V. and Associated Students officials, presented a petition calling on the sheriff and the County Board of Supervisors to “cease and desist the publication of release dates of all people within the Sheriff’s custody.”</p>\n<p>This sentiment was echoed by the 19 speakers who followed, including representatives from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice and the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>\n<p>Some of those representatives shared personal anecdotes of family members being taken away by immigration enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p>“I think most of us can agree that the federal government has failed to create a workable immigration process,” Gina Whitaker, an Allies for Immigration representative, said. “There is no line to get into for millions of people who face increasing persecution. The reasons that people are here undocumented are varied and complex and often beyond their control.</p>\n<p>“We need to consider the individual circumstances of each person’s life and recognize the humanity of all people.”</p>\n<p>Joana Barrera, a representative for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (C.A.U.S.E.), shared a personal story of her family being separated after police cooperation with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>She explained that her brother had finished his community service when he had been picked up by I.C.E.</p>\n<p>“Luckily he knew his rights and we were able to find him and pick him up from a local shopping center,” she said. “But that really speaks amounts about the lack of trust between the government and residents.”</p>\n<p>“If a person who happens to be an immigrant commits harm, they need to be held accountable like anyone else. But the actions of a few people should not be used to scapegoat whole communities.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
