We were really without Phoebe completely, and Lindsey played just a little bit since it was her first match back after hardly practicing,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted. “Even with the team we had on the floor last time, we felt confident that if we had cleaned up a few things, [the match] would have gone a different way. Now we just have more strength.”</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins will look to regain her early season magic as she continues to get her feet back under her after an injury derailed her contributions early in the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman — eighth in Big West play with 3.64 kills per set — and freshman middle blocker Rowan Ennis — fifteenth in conference play with 2.76 kills per set — will accompany Ruddins in a now fairly healthy Gaucho attack.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt will also be back after playing in some light action last weekend, and she, too, will hope to reproduce her early season dominance.</p>\n<p>The defense, as usual, will be centered around sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who continues to lead the Big West in digs per set with 4.72 and total digs with 326.</p>\n<p>The libero also earned her second Big West Defensive Player of the Week Honors of the season after registering 49 digs in two matches last week against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to use its home court advantage to its full benefit in hopes of extending its one win over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday into a winning streak.</p>\n<p>The longest streak it has put together thus far this season is fives games, which occurred in the earlier portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>When on the losing end of the spectrum, the Gauchos have not tended well, having been swept in six of their eight losses losses this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, and Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with both games being played at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/gauchos-remain-at-t-dome-for-the-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/gauchos-remain-at-t-dome-for-the-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/gauchos-remain-at-t-dome-for-the-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/gauchos-remain-at-t-dome-for-the-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/gauchos-remain-at-t-dome-for-the-weekend/","id":5432,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5431,5430,5429],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Falls to Long Beach State 3-1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road at Long Beach State to kick off a four-game road trip, the No. 12 UCSB men’s volleyball team fell to the 49ers 3-1 on Friday.

They were ready to go. We actually played tough with them the first two games, then they took over.”</p>\n<p>Using that momentum from the UCLA victory, Long Beach came out attacking against the Gauchos, taking the first set 25-20.</p>\n<p>Bouncing back however, was a Santa Barbara squad that has improved as of late. The Gauchos needed extra points to overcome Long Beach capturing the second set 30-28 in a tough back-and-forth battle.</p>\n<p>“It looked like we just lost focus pretty much right out of the gate,” junior middle blocker Dylan Davis said. “We weren’t all with it. I think it was just one of those games where we failed to come together in the beginning. We came out flat in the beginning and we were never able to recover from it.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Long Beach offense was junior middle blocker Colten Echave with a game-high 17 kills. Echave helped the 49ers to a 25-15 victory in the third set to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Overall, the 49ers had six players who recorded eight or more kills in the game. Long Beach used that diversity to overpower UCSB, clinching the match with a 25-20 win in the fourth and final set.</p>\n<p>“It was really what was on the court that was the biggest factor in the game,” Davis said. “We didn’t bring what we needed to.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, junior outside hitter Miles Evans led the Gauchos with a team-high 16 kills, while freshman outside hitter Kevin Donohue continued to impress with a game-high 12 digs and 13 kills of his own.</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Weston Nielsen contributed eight digs, five kills and five blocks for the Gauchos, while Davis had five kills and three blocks.</p>\n<p>“Our blocking is coming around,” McLaughlin said. “You’re always going to block better against some teams than you do against others just because you match up better with them, and we matched up pretty good with Long Beach. We were able to block pretty well, we just didn’t receive serves real well.”</p>\n<p>As a squad, Santa Barbara recorded 11 team blocks compared to 13 for Long Beach.</p>\n<p>“Our blocking is getting better, slowly but surely,” Davis said. “We’ve been working on it a lot in practice. We just need to keep working on every aspect of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues their road trip on Friday when they travel to BYU. First serve is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44841\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-falls-long-beach-state-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44841\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-falls-long-beach-state-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-falls-long-beach-state-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-falls-long-beach-state-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-21/ucsb-falls-long-beach-state-31/","id":5429,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5428,5427,5426],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battle Back to Overcome BYU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Down two games to none at No. 3 BYU, the UCSB men’s volleyball team rallied on Saturday night, capturing three consecutive sets to give the Gauchos their biggest victory of the season.

The Gauchos, who were in 10th place before the trip to Utah, currently sit in a three-way tie for eighth place and the final spot in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>“This win is probably one of the most important wins of our season as far as trying to make the playoffs,” Evans said. “We still have a long way to go, but this win helped us in a lot of ways to make the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>BYU, meanwhile, falls to 11-4 (7-3 MPSF) on the season and currently sits in fourth place in the conference, a drop from their spot at third before entering the series with Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“From this win, we believe in ourselves a little bit more and we think we can take some of the top five teams in the league,” Evans said.</p>\n<p>Boosting the Gauchos to victory was freshman outside hitter Austin Kingi, who, in his first two opportunities to play this season, recorded a combined 25 kills over the weekend. Kingi led all players in Saturday’s match with a career-high 18 kills, while also recording 14 digs to catapult UCSB over BYU.</p>\n<p>“I think it was important because we needed another solid outside hitter to help spread the offense out,” Kingi said. “We could spread the ball out and have a more effective offense.”</p>\n<p>Evans once again proved pivotal for the Gauchos, recording 15 kills and 13 digs while freshman outside hitter Kevin Donohue added 16 kills and seven digs. The trio of outside hitters gave the Gauchos a versatile offensive attack to help overcome a strong Cougar squad.</p>\n<p>“Beating BYU at their home was a huge win for us and gave us a lot of confidence,” Evans said. “Now we know that we can go to a top team in our league, at their gym, and we can take them. We just have to stay confident and really put it on them and compete to the best level that we can.”</p>\n<p>Falling behind 2-0 in Saturday’s match, the Gauchos captured three consecutive games to secure the 3-2 victory in the face of a raucous BYU crowd. Despite losing 3-1 to BYU on Friday, UCSB salvaged their weekend in what appears to be their most important victory to date.</p>\n<p>“We just stayed composed and really played as a team, not as individuals,” Evans said. “We really stuck together, and if we ever made a mistake or got a kill or a big point, we’d bring it in close. We had a lot of energy whether we won or lost the point and stayed confident, and that really helped us play better, with better team chemistry.”</p>\n<p>With their weekend split, the Gauchos have positioned themselves into the thick of the MPSF race for the final spot in the conference tournament and are tied with Hawaii and Northridge for eighth. They currently sit one game behind Long Beach for seventh in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It was really important to give us some momentum to try to get into playoffs,” Kingi said. “It shows that we can definitely be one of the top teams. Right now, anyone can beat anyone. You get these chances, and it just gives us confidence to get into the playoffs and keep moving on and getting better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Northridge on Wednesday for a 7 p.m. match.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45018\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-battle-overcome-byu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45018\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-battle-overcome-byu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-battle-overcome-byu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-battle-overcome-byu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-27/gauchos-battle-overcome-byu/","id":5430,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5429,5428,5427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 11 Gauchos Host No. 8 Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After falling Wednesday night in a heated contest, the No. 11 UCSB men’s volleyball team will look to gain revenge tonight when they host No. 8 Long Beach State.

It’s just a matter of passing and staying focused if we want to come out on top.”</p>\n<p>Coming off a momentous win over No. 1 UCLA the last time UCSB faced Long Beach, the 49ers were swept by the Bruins on the road on Wednesday night, marking their second loss in the last three matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB may have the upper hand this time around, as Long Beach holds a 1-5 record on the road, compared to a 5-2 mark in home contests. The Gauchos, meanwhile, are hoping to improve on their 3-5 mark in home matches after returning from a four-game road trip.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be good, I’m excited to play in front of a home crowd again,” Davis said. “It’s always fun to play inside of Rob [Gym], so hopefully that should give us a little bit of momentum when we play Long Beach [tonight].”</p>\n<p>On their road trip, UCSB finished with a 1-3 mark, highlighted by an impressive comeback victory over No. 5 BYU. The match against Long Beach marks the first of a five-game homestand that will last until the end of spring break when they will hit the road again.</p>\n<p>Davis, who recorded career-highs in kills and blocks against Northridge with 22 and 14, hopes to carry over the impressive performances, but also coming along with a win this time around.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach isn’t as tough as a serving team as Northridge, so hopefully our passing game should be a lot better,” Davis said. “I think we’re pretty prepared for the match [tonight].”</p>\n<p>Despite losing to Long Beach earlier in the year, the Gauchos are in no way intimidated facing the 49ers, as they hope to capitalize on the opportunity to exact revenge for the loss.</p>\n<p>“We look forward to getting them up here and playing them again,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said immediately after the loss to Long Beach in February. “I think it’s a team that we can compete with for sure.”</p>\n<p>Rolling as of late, the Gaucho offense will try to keep their momentum against a 49ers defense ranking third in the conference in opponent hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Hoping to sustain their recent play, Davis and a trio of outside hitters in junior Miles Evans and freshmen Austin Kingi and Kevin Donohue formed an outstanding attacking squad against Northridge, totaling a combined 57 of the team’s 66 kills in the match.</p>\n<p>First serve tonight against Long Beach is set for 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/11-gauchos-host-8-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/11-gauchos-host-8-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/11-gauchos-host-8-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/11-gauchos-host-8-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-02/11-gauchos-host-8-long-beach-state/","id":5431,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5430,5429,5428],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
