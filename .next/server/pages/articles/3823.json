The subject was extremely confused, and asked himself out loud, “Where am I? Well, how did I get here?”</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked how much the man had to drink, the subject sheepishly confessed, “I pissed myself and I only had two beers.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and providing false information to a peace officer, and was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>You and the Cap’n, Make it Happen<br>\nFriday, Sept. 28, 10:47 p.m. – Residents of a house on the 6800 block of Sabado Tarde Road reported to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol that an unknown man was passed out on their deck.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived at the scene, they found the 19-year-old subject looking unkempt and detected, by his stench, that he had soiled his clothing.</p>\n<p>When the man saw the deputies, he attempted to stand, but immediately fell to the ground. The officers soon understood why.</p>\n<p>The man puffed up his chest and announced that he had taken 30 shots of Captain Morgan. Following his proud pronouncement, he tried to approach the officers to explain that he was OK, but again fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>Due to his extreme level of inebriation, the man was arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, he vomited in the van before falling asleep in the puke-y puddle.</p>\n<p>You Say It’s Your Birthday<br>\nSunday, Sept. 30, 12:05 a.m. – Deputies contacted a 19-year-old man after they observed him disturbing a group of women walking down the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>After confirming that the man did not know the women he was attempting to hit on, the officer sent him home.</p>\n<p>The deputy watched the man walk away and noticed that he had a very unsteady gait. After watching him run into a parked car, the deputy and his partner began following the suave subject.</p>\n<p>Officers had been trailing the man for approximately three minutes when they observed the man collide with yet another parked vehicle. They then decided to arrest him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>During questioning and booking at the I.V. Foot Patrol Station, the subject revealed his name and told officers that his birthday was “100036.” The self-proclaimed 71-year-old subject then began vomiting before he passed out.</p>\n<p>The man was transported the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he woke up with a hangover and a criminal record.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/","id":3823,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3822,3821,3820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore","biography":"Not available","articles":[454,2872,3823,3860,3861,3863,3883,3884],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last week, Santa Barbra police officials made three different arrests for large-scale drug charges, with one arrest involving a Santa Barbara City College student found to be in possession of one poun...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, Santa Barbra police officials made three different arrests for large-scale drug charges, with one arrest involving a Santa Barbara City College student found to be in possession of one pound of MDMA — a drug chemically consistent with ecstasy that is also known as “Molly”.</p>\n<p>19-year-old Isla Vista resident Joshua Steinhorn was arrested at his apartment for possessing roughly $45,000 worth of MDMA. Steinhorn is being charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Santa Barbara County police officials also arrested two Santa Barbara residents for possession of half an ounce of heroin, which holds an estimated street value of $1,500. One of the suspects, 29-year-old Donald Windsor, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, transportation of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia while 25-year-old Cassidy Morse was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p>Although Steinhorn was initially booked into Santa Barbara County with his bail set at $30,000, he was released on March 22 and is expected to appear in court again on April 25. Both Windsor and Morse are being held at Santa Barbara County jail, with Windor’s bail set at $35,000. Morses’s bail is set at $2,500, although he is not currently eligible for bail as he had an active felony warrant for his arrest at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>— Staff report</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 3rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-03/police-blotter-77/","id":3820,"author":{"id":271,"name":"Nexus Staff Report"},"related":[3819,3818,3817],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Officers Search for Suspects After DP Stabbing, Assault ","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UCSB Police Department officers are actively searching for two suspects in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred just after midnight Saturday morning on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>Sherriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said the incident began with a verbal altercation between a group of about four people and two males that escalated when one victim was stabbed in the back and another was hit in the head with a bottle.</p>\n<p>Officers responded to 6579 Del Playa at approximately 12:20 a.m. and were unable to locate any of the four original suspects — three males and one female — after searching the area extensively, Hoover said.

bus system is adding 14 new electric shuttles and introducing new farebox and smartphone technology to modernize its system as well as rebranding its 30-year-old logo.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) will accompany the technology with a new student access system in the next year, along with making changes to bus schedules beginning Aug. 21.</p>\n<p>According to reports by the American Public Transportation Association, UC Santa Barbara student ridership has increased by 31 percent from 2011 to 2016 — a contrast to the dropping rates both nationwide and in California.</p>\n<p>Nationwide ridership is decreasing, said Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, due in part to a sustained period of low gas prices and the change in landscape for transportation.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said they cannot point out a specific reason for declining ridership, but they are “definitely interested in competing for people’s ridership.”</p>\n<p>According to the MTD 2016-2021 Strategic Plan, “The vision of MTD is that public transit within the District should be so available and attractive that use of an automobile is a choice, not a necessity.”</p>\n<p>Despite national and statewide ridership trends, 14 new electric shuttles are being custom-made in Lancaster, CA, and after thorough training and testing, they will slowly be introduced to the district this summer.</p>\n<p>The new shuttles “show [their] commitment to the environment,” Blackerby said, and she hopes their schedule adjustments will improve bus arrival timing.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the proposed schedule adjustments hope to combat traffic congestion, primarily near the Storke and Hollister intersection, which is caused by the new housing developments that have changed the traffic flow.</p>\n<p>MTD is also testing student ACCESS cards to see if they will be compatible with new fareboxes that will be installed later this year.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the new boxes will work based off of a list of active student ID numbers that determine rider eligibility when a card is swiped. The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. MTD officials are still negotiating the details with the university, she said.</p>\n<p>A new smartphone app will also launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route, Blackerby said. The service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users.</p>\n<p>“As someone who has waited hours in line” at the A.S. Ticket Office to get a bus sticker, third-year history of public policy major and Off-Campus Senator Batsheva Stoll said she is looking forward to the new farebox system.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she believes this change will best serve students that live in the Santa Catalina dormitories because “They are the ones that use the bus the most to get to school.”</p>\n<p>Lines 12x and 24x, which run from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. A few isolated trips will be removed throughout the day so the buses’ arrival times are more consistent.</p>\n<p>Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x, 23 and 25 will be slightly adjusted in timing but not reduced in frequency. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said Transit Planner Mark Clyde.</p>\n<p>Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10-minute to 15-minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</p>\n<p>The Nexus previously reported that a potential route from Goleta to Carpinteria during the morning and evening commute hours would become available through Caltrans funding. Blackerby told the <em>Nexus</em>, however, that Caltrans decided to not fund the project.</p>\n<p>“Their schedule is not tracking correctly with what is happening in reality, and to a lot of people [the changes] look like a cut at first, but I think they did a good job at clarifying,” said Director of the Isla Vista Community Services District Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have a schedule that is in line with reality so that folks don’t end up waiting at a bus stop,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/","id":3822,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3821,3820,3819],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
