They enter tonight’s matchup with a record of 2-3.</p>\n<p>Although expectations weren’t exactly sky-high for USC coming into the year, a big 72-69 upset road win over then No. 20 Wichita St. one week ago capped a surprising 5-0 perfect start to the season. The Trojans have since dropped their last two games on the road to No. 12 Xavier and Monmouth and come to Santa Barbara at 5-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Inconsistent shooting had been the story for the Gauchos to start the season, but they appeared to find some answers on the offensive end in their last two outings, particularly from their starting guards in junior Eric Childress and sophomore Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Against Arizona St. on Sunday, Childress put up an all-around stat line characteristic of his ability to do all the little things, recording nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Vincent, who had been particularly struggling with his shot through the first three games of the year, went 12-25 from the field and 6-13 from deep over the past two games. He is averaging 10.8 points and 1.4 steals per game, good for third and second best on the team, respectively.</p>\n<p>Two players who have most certainly not hurt UCSB’s shooting percentage are seniors Michael Bryson and Sam Beeler. Since missing the first game of the season due to suspension, Bryson has stepped easily into his role as the team’s best offensive player, shooting a team-best 37.5 percent from three and 48.2 percent from the field. His 18.8 points per game average ranks second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beeler, who has started all five games at center, has shot an extremely efficient 76 percent from the field, finding most of his shots deep in the paint for an average of 7.6 points a night.</p>\n<p>The Trojans’ 5-0 start to this season was their best start since going 8-0 in 2000-01. They are led on the offensive side by former Etiwanda High School standout guard Jordan McLaughlin. The sophomore, who was voted one of the team’s two captains for the 2015-16 season, was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team last season with averages of 12.1 points, three rebounds and 4.5 assists. He has been especially hot to open this season, leading the team with 15.3 points per contest and shooting 55.2 percent overall and 51.9 percent on threes.</p>\n<p>Backing him up are junior guard Julian Jacobs and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, who come in averaging 12.4 points each. In just his freshman year, Boatwright has impressed with an ability to score from inside and out, tying McLaughlin for the team lead in three-pointers made with two per game.</p>\n<p>Jacobs has shown that he can do much more than just score, sitting at second on the team with averages of 6.3 rebounds and 1.28 steals and leading the way with 5.5 assists.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be the Gauchos’ last home game of 2015 before playing their next six on the road. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/","id":342,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[341,340,339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos’ Resurgent Second Half Performance Earns 81-68 Win vs. CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 54 points scored in the second half helped the UCSB men's basketball team to overcome a seven-point deficit coming out of halftime.

The Gauchos responded with improved energy and effort coming out of halftime, outhustling Fullerton in statistical categories that included rebounding, assists, field goal percentage, and ball possession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara controlled the pace of the game in every facet of the second half— shooting 66 percent from the field and 77 percent from downtown while it contained the Titans for the majority of Saturday’s contest, holding CSUF to a dismal overall field goal percentage of 38 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on their trips to the line as well, making 13-17 on the night from behind the stripe to finish with a 76.5 free-throw percentage, a major improvement from their 53.8 percent outing against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Influencing UCSB’s improvement on offense in the second half was its ability to penetrate the Titans’ defense when driving the ball.</p>\n<p>“We got great space off of our drives [in the second half],” Williams said. “Our penetration created open shots for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB was poised when handling the ball. It concluded Satuday’s game with just nine turnovers, a total below the Gauchos’ season average of 13.3 per game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Eric Childress played a major role in UCSB’s victory Saturday night, registering only one turnover in the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Childress, learning from his six point and five turnover performance last Thursday against Hawaii, was aggressive with his attack which provided a much-needed boost behind scoring threats Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson. The Hawthorne, CA native finished with 13 points and seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>“Eric was shooting the ball under great control and had great poise,” Williams said. “He looked so in control of his game offensively and it really caused problems for Fullerton’s guards.”</p>\n<p>Childress’ control of the ball also resulted in more scoring opportunities for Vincent and Bryson. The two tallied 45 points Saturday night, 20 for the sophomore guard and 25 for the senior Bryson. It was an efficient shooting night for Vincent as he finished 7-15 from the floor and made a game-high 5-7 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be aggressive and look for shots to attack,” Vincent said. “We can always get shots up from the perimeter, I was hitting the three tonight, but I was really trying to get out in transition and get to the rim.”</p>\n<p>Bryson also flirted with a triple-double, grabbing a game-high nine rebounds and tying Childress’ game-high of seven assists. His 25-point performance helped him to climb to eighth-place on the Gauchos’ all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>Young players like Jarriesse Blackmon contributed quality minutes this weekend as well. While the freshman forward did not score in his nine minutes of action, the Salt Lake City native pulled down a career-high eight boards for his team, five of them offensive rebounds giving UCSB second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>“[Jarriese] is not afraid of the moment and not afraid to try and make plays,” Williams stated. “He’s a high energy guy and that’s what we needed out of him tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hope to take Saturday’s home victory and use its momentum for the team’s two-game road trip starting at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“[We need to take] the energy, enthusiasm, and accountability we played with tonight into next week,” Williams said. “[Our guys] understand that we’ve dug ourselves a whole and the only way to get out of it is by playing hard and playing better.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to the Pavillion on Thursday, Feb. 11 to face the Aggies. Tip-off will take place at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/","id":339,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[338,337,336],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope to Bounce Back at UCI & LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's basketball team is looking to pick up a pair of Big West wins after losing three of its last four conference games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After being defeated by a game-winning three-pointer in the remaining seconds of last Saturday’s game against Hawaii, the UCSB women’s basketball team looks to recoup on the road at UC Irvine tonight and at Long Beach State on Saturday.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68081\" style=\"width: 201px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68081\" data-attachment-id=\"68081\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/je-zhe-newton-pushes-her-way-to-the-hoop-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Je Zhé Newton pushes her way to the hoop.

Including last Saturday’s loss, in four of five games following a 20-plus point performance, she has registered single-figures in scoring.</p>\n<p>With the Big West Conference Tournament approaching, Roper is hoping to become a more consistent scorer for UCSB on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“Taking the game slower and step by step” Roper explained. “Not rushing anything, just letting it flow — it all starts in practice.”</p>\n<p>Occupying the Gauchos’ game plan heading into Thursday’s contest is their strategy to combat the Anteaters’ size and depth.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of dribble moves,” Henrickson said. “It’s not a traditional sit down deep, pivot and score [offense]. It’s get off the block a little bit, face you, rip and drive, back you down and spin. There’s a lot of dribbling involved and its multiple moves. So our bigs have got to stay down and keep their feet alive.”</p>\n<p>Despite the versatility within their frontcourt, the Anteaters haven’t had much production offensively this season. Overall, they rank last in field goal percentage at 34.4 percent, three-point percentage at 22.3 percent and their average of 12.1 assists per game ranks eighth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Irvine’s defense has emerged during its lack of offense. The Anteaters have held three of their last four opponents under 60 points and recently allowed a season-low 50 points in their loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A central figure within UCI’s stout defense has been the play of Mokun Fajemisin. A junior forward, Fajemisin grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds and had two blocks against the Mustangs. Her total of 40 blocks and 2.0 rejections per game leads the Big West. In addition, Fajemisin ranks fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 7.7 average and a total of 154 rebounds this year.</p>\n<p>Her blocking abilities have influenced the rest of the team since the start of Big West play as the Anteaters lead the conference with an average of 4.6 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Finding a way to combat UCI’s size will be most important for the Gauchos, who are depleted in size this season.</p>\n<p>Closing out UCSB’s road trip is its matchup against Long Beach State. The 49ers are coming off of a 22-10 season last year in which they put together a 15-game winning streak at one point, but faltered during the conference schedule as they finished with a 9-7 record.</p>\n<p>LBSU was knocked out of the first round of the Big West Conference Tournament by CSUF, then loss in the first round of the WNIT to San Diego.</p>\n<p>In the midst of a five-game winning streak and in second place, the 49ers may be in route to a strong finish to conference play. Thus far, it has been Long Beach’s defense that has led it to such a solid start.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ average of 21.5 turnovers forced per game leads the Big West and ranks 12th in the nation. Despite nearly being upset and allowing 71 points in an overtime win at CSUN, Long Beach State has held 12 opponents to 60 points or fewer and five to under 50 points this season.</p>\n<p>Complementing the 49ers’ defense is their shooting from behind the three-point line. They rank third in the Big West in three-point percentage at 32 percent. Most notably, LBSU set a single-game program and Big West record of 20 three-pointers made in its 82-61 victory at CSUF.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UCI is set for 7 p.m. tonight at the Bren Events Center. The Gauchos game at LBSU will take place on Saturday, Feb. 13 at 4 p.m. in Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 11, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/gauchos-hope-to-bounce-back-at-uci-lbsu/","id":340,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[339,338,337],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sisterly Ties: From the Court to the Heart","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=801%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Put into perspective is the influence of family, specifically her older sister Afure, in the life of third-year point guard Onome Jemerigbe of the UCSB women's basketball team.

But it’s great having multiple siblings. I’ve always loved the fact that there’s always multiple people to talk to; it’s like having three best friends.”</p>\n<p>Of those three best friends, the relationship with her only sister, Afure, developed into a relatability beyond the ties of lineage, for it also revolved on the basketball court.</p>\n<p>“She’s [Afure] definitely one of the biggest influences I have as a person and for the reasons why I play basketball,” Onome explained. “She started off playing basketball when she was young. Me being the youngest, I always kind of copied my older siblings, so I kind of followed her into it. Her love for the game influenced me to even try out for basketball.”</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, Afure’s love for the game of basketball didn’t develop without the persistence of a valiant effort that was committed to improving everyday. Nonetheless, Onome served as a constant reminder in ensuring Afure displayed her best at all times.</p>\n<p>“I have always had an incredible love for the game. It was that love that made playing basketball so much fun for me,” Afure said. “I truly believe that Onome plays the way that she does, with so much heart and passion because she too has this love for the sport.”</p>\n<p>Afure attended and played basketball for St. Mary’s High School from 2006-2010. She ranked No. 15 on ESPN HoopGurlz 100 list during her senior year and was a 2010 McDonald’s All-American.</p>\n<p>When Afure was a senior at St. Mary’s, Onome was a freshman. While it was one of the few opportunities for the two to play together, Afure made sure to cherish her last year both being around and playing with her sister.</p>\n<p>“When baby sis played with me for a year during her freshman year in high school, my senior year, I loved it,” she said. “I could watch over her. Make sure she was doing her homework especially on the road games. She was the point guard and could see things from a perspective that I couldn’t, and as a wing guard and an experienced athlete, I could see things that she couldn’t. We have always had such a fun, goofy and close sister to sister relationship. I consider her to be my best friend. I want her to always be the best person that she can be, and I knew that it in order for her to be that, that it started with me. It started with me because I am her older sister and she looked up to me. We were always around each other.”</p>\n<p>Yet their time together would end with Afure attending and playing basketball at the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating in 2014, she played one season overseas in Spain for Al-Qazeres women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It is through these experiences in which Afure has been able to help guide Onome throughout her career. Specifically, helping enhance Onome’s capabilities both on and off the court is most paramount.</p>\n<p>“From playing at Cal and then going to play overseas, I learned the importance of good character. Character is what is deep inside us; it’s who we are on a daily basis, when things go well and when things go wrong,” Afure said. “It’s who we are in the locker room, on the court as well as in the classroom. We have reason to be proud when both reputation and character are a mirror image of each other.”</p>\n<p>As Onome was in her first year at UCSB, Afure was a senior preparing to conclude her collegiate career at Cal. Although the two sisters were members of opposing programs, Afure helped integrate Onome into the duties and responsibilities of being a collegiate student-athlete.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the stuff she [Afure] went through has helped me to become a better player,” Onome said. “I’m not the perfect player, but I’ve definitely grown because of her. She explained what she should have done, all the mistakes she made. It helps me to not make the same mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Currently in her third year at UCSB as the floor general for the Gauchos’ women’s basketball team, Onome has had an immediate impact on the court since her arrival. Thus far, she has started in 79 of 86 career games played, having started all 29 games her sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Her performance through the years has resulted in her being named to the 2013-14 All-Big West Freshman Team, and she was an Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient last season.</p>\n<p>So far this year, Onome has excelled since the start of the Big West Conference schedule, leading the conference in assists per game with a 5.4 average while ranking second in steals per game with 2.1.</p>\n<p>She also set career-highs in scoring with 20 points at UC Davis and 11 assists versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>While her individual accolades do not surpass the team’s long-term goals and the role she plays in them, Onome accredits her maturation as a person to her production on the court.</p>\n<p>“Freshman year, I was easily bothered,” she said. “Not to say that I don’t get bothered every once in a while, but I’ve definitely grown in the mental part of basketball. Just being able to control my emotions and make sure I give my all every time despite if I have turnovers or if we weren’t being successful as a team.”</p>\n<p>While Onome continues to impress on the court and owes much appreciation to Afure for inspiring her love of the game in addition to providing advice on life as a collegiate student-athlete, true inspiration for both sisters begins with their mother. An immigrant from Nigeria who persevered and raised four children, Onome acknowledges her mother as the constant reminder to continue to work hard each day.</p>\n<p>“My mother keeps me balanced, keeps my head straight,” Onome said. “She always seems to know what to say to get me back on track.”</p>\n<p>It has been the existence of this family foundation that has contributed to the person Onome is both on and off the court. According to her, the core to this foundation originates with one word: loyalty.</p>\n<p>“They’re the people that are going to be there for you when times are hard and when times are good,” Onome said. “You can always rely on them to support you and be there for you.”</p>\n<p>Afure has epitomized this essence of loyalty all along, and is now just attempting to replicate the same support system that was provided to her.</p>\n<p>“Home is where heart is. Family is the epicenter of all reasons. Family to me is root of my very existence,” she said. “Without family we wouldn’t be the people that we are today.”</p>\n<p>While basketball helped to further establish the relationship between sisters Onome and Afure, it never defined their bond.</p>\n<p>Once the shot clock hits zero and it’s time to hand in your jersey, the temporary reality of basketball is realized, but family is forever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/","id":341,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[340,339,338],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
