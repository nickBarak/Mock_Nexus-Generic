The subsequent water damage due to the roof failure was extensive, requiring the relocation of over 16 staff as well as the front desk operation for HDAE,” Miller said in an email.</p>\n<p>She noted that the storm brought several inches of water into about 85 percent to 95 percent of the main office, along with water damage to the furniture and fallen ceiling tiles.</p>\n<p>Since the storm, university staff has been working with contractors to remove damaged building parts – including air handling units and electric systems – while also “shoring up the damaged roof structure for safety and to mitigate further water damage during winter rain events,” Miller added.</p>\n<p>The service will remain in the space from anywhere between two and four months, depending on the extent of the damage done to the office, according to UCen Director Gary Lawrence.</p>\n<p>“The University Center, in consultation with HDAE management, agreed to help out with a temporary relocation of some HDAE staff whose offices were seriously damaged in one of the recent storms,” Lawrence said in an email.</p>\n<p>HDAE will be paying the “standard rate” charged by the UCen, according to Miller.

Courtesy<em> of Blake Simons and Delency Parham</em></p></div>\n<p>The two Bay Area natives released the first episode of the “Hella Black Podcast” in 2015 with the goal of amplifying Black voices and covering topics that are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>“With each episode we hope to educate and inform our listeners on all things related to Blackness. Our podcast is important because it uplifts the voices of Black radical organizers who are doing the work in the field. Often times our narratives are not told,” the two wrote on their <a href=\"https://www.hellablackpod.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>Coming to UCSB as a podcast host is a welcome change for both Simons and Parham.</p>\n<p>Simons attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and Parham attended Santa Barbara City College before transferring to the University of Idaho. Both played sports at their respective universities.</p>\n<p>“I think about my experience as a student-athlete at SBCC, and it was hard enough getting folks on my own campus to take me serious. I experienced students at the UC thinking they were better than me and other students at the city college. So to come back here, and have students gathered in a room to listen to Blake and I host a live podcast…never something that would [have] crossed my mind,” Parham said in an email.</p>\n<p>The two only recently began doing live shows for the “Hella Black Podcast” in September 2018.</p>\n<p>“As the podcast started gaining more traction, we thought it would be dope to be able to engage with people and create a radical space in person to have the conversations we have. We’ve had shows in Oakland, Los Angeles, where over 100 people pulled up to each show,” Simons said in the email.</p>\n<p>While the two both have a background in writing, they realized that podcasting would allow them to reach a larger audience.</p>\n<p>“Folks might not have time to read a full article due to the constraints that capitalism puts on people, but you can listen to the podcast on your way to work or when you’re doing laundry,” Simons added.</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, financial director for the Black Student Union at UCSB, worked with A.S. Program Board Cultural &amp; Arts Coordinator Kiyomi Morrison to pull the event together.</p>\n<p>Gessesse wanted to bring the two to campus because of their experiences being Black on predominantly white campuses, and especially because of Simons’ work co-founding the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s BSU is currently trying to develop an agreement for UCSB to build a freestanding building where Black students can get access to resources and have a space for themselves.</p>\n<p>“Blake himself has pioneered a lot of what we are trying to achieve for here at our own campus, but having been a Cal alum, a UC product and having worked within the UC system for several years since he’s graduated, I felt like he could share insight to what it’s like being black within the UC,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>As an “avid listener of the podcast” herself, Gessesse believes the two tackle topics that are typically stigmatized. Some of the podcast episodes dive into sex work, the intersection of Blackness and queerness and exploitation of Black student athletes.</p>\n<p>“I want to take the time to acknowledge all the queer/trans folks, and Black women that have put in numerous hours of labor to help me develop healthier perspectives and radical politics. Blake and I like to use our platform as an opportunity to uplift their voices,” Parham said.</p>\n<p>“We both know in a patriarchal society, men’s voices will be the voices that are projected. We want to use our privilege to center the most disrespected and threatened, and be in solidarity with them.”</p>\n<p>Parham and Simons also cite their Bay Area roots and their familial connection to members of the Black Panther Party as the inspiration for their discussions.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest draws of the podcast is that the two also work as community organizers and educators, having their boots on the ground in addition to speaking on the subject.</p>\n<p>“Teaching is one way I build community and help educate Black people on the conditions of our people,” Simons said. “As community organizers we both create programs that center the most vulnerable Black people under this white supremacist capitalist state.”</p>\n<p>The two cofounded the People’s Breakfast Oakland, which provides houseless people with hot foods, clothing and hygiene products.</p>\n<p>Gessesse hopes that students attending the event come away with ideas about how to keep the needs of Black students in the fold even after Black History Month is over.</p>\n<p>“I really anticipate that not only does this talk, this conversation, does not stop at the end of February when Black History Month is over, but that we continue to make these strides in our community about coming together,” she said.</p>\n<p>At the same time, she hopes the show on Friday night can be a place where Black students come to unwind and be in a space tailor-made for them.</p>\n<p>“Being Black is political, yes, but not everything that Black people do has to be political.”</p>\n<p>Simons and Parham will be hosting their live show on Friday, March 1, at the Loma Pelona Center at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this story said that Simons alone hosts the People’s Breakfast Oakland. Simons and Parham co-founded it together.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Although both players announced the same thing, this case is different and carries more significance because Collins is a man.</p>\n<p>Superstars from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Durant, as well as current and former teammates of Collins, have expressed their support for him. Because of the politically correct environment we live in and fear of getting labeled as homophobic by the media, it is unlikely we will hear other athletes, except Mike Wallace of the NFL, speak out against Collins’ sexual preference. Still, he in all likelihood will suffer from intolerant verbal abuse from players and fans if he does play in the NBA again.</p>\n<p>The announcement marks the first step for Collins. However, the next phase is to actually step onto the court and play. Collins is already at the declining stage of his career and is nothing more than a solid role player off the bench at best. He’s coming off a year where he played a total of 38 games and scored 41 total points, averaging eight minutes per game.</p>\n<p>The next NBA team to sign Collins will likely sign him because of his leadership abilities on and off the court. Yet, if no team ends up signing him, it will diminish the importance of him coming out, as there still would not be an openly gay player to play professionally. The magnitude of Collins coming out hinders on if he actually ends up on the roster of an NBA team by next season.</p>\n<p>Only then will we be able to see the progress American sports has made in regards to accepting gay athletes into their profession; otherwise, Collins will be just another athlete who came out after his playing days were over. A Stanford graduate and well-spoken individual, Collins serves as the perfect ambassador for gay male athletes in a culture that has repeatedly rejected antimasculine behavior.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of speculation of players in the NFL coming out and it will be interesting to see how football players and the league reacts when this happens, especially since the NFL has had trouble dealing with the sensitivity of the issue. Nonetheless, the NBA has handled this case perfectly with Commissioner David Stern issuing his support.</p>\n<p>Collins no doubt made this decision for his own well-being, as he admitted he didn’t intend to be the first male athlete to come out, but his choice to come out marks an important milestone for sports in the country. More importantly, his announcement serves as an inspiration for active and future gay athletes to play their careers being who they are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of sports.inquirer.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/","id":3192,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3191,3190,3189],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Wide  Open Western Conference: Oklahoma City is Still the Team to Beat","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Miami takes the East, Oklahoma City takes the West.

Up until the injury, he appeared in an NBA-best 394 straight regular season games and played in all 45 of the Thunder’s playoff appearances.</p>\n<p>Westbrook’s absence leaves no clear taker in the Western Conference. Up 3-1 in the series with Houston, OKC will certainly advance to the next round, but without its all-star point guard, there is also doubt as to whether the team will make the NBA Finals for a second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>The West is a deep conference with seeds one through six all showing they have potential to go far into the postseason. When OKC defeats Houston, it will play the winner of the four/five series, which is a very close series between the L.A. Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies. Memphis would be a better matchup for the Thunder because Memphis is a more defensively-oriented team. However, the Clippers, with Blake Griffin and a deep pool of guards, including Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups, Eric Bledsoe and Jamal Crawford, could give the Thunder troubles on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>If the Thunder can get by L.A., they’ve probably got the best shot at taking the West, since San Antonio doesn’t have the young athleticism to come close to matching OKC. And the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets both lack the experience and depth that OKC has.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that a team typically has to be peaking and playing its best basketball during the playoffs, the Thunder have the depth to still go all the way.</p>\n<p>Filling in for Westbrook is the young Reggie Jackson. He’s only a rookie and has little postseason experience as a result, but he is very athletic. The Thunder like to score, ranking third in the NBA with 105.7 points per game, and Jackson can certainly help the team do that.</p>\n<p>He’s a versatile athlete, and, like Westbrook, will push the ball. He certainly isn’t going to average Westbrook’s dynamite stat line of 23.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game, but Jackson has already stepped up for OKC. He’s averaged 11.8 points per game in the playoffs, over six more than his regular-season average. Without Westbrook, he’s increased that number to 16.0 points per game, proving he could be a solid role player for the Thunder down the stretch.</p>\n<p>OKC may be starting a rookie, but it has one of the best veteran point guards coming off the bench in Derek Fisher. Fisher is calm and poised with the ball and his past has definitely proved he can hit any shot no matter the pressure.</p>\n<p>Another offensive threat for the Thunder is guard Kevin Martin, who is great moving without the ball but can also knock down the three. He averages 14.0 points per game and shoots an impressive 42.6 percent from behind the arc, spreading the defense and clearing space for all-star Kevin Durant.</p>\n<p>Thabo Sefolosha isn’t going to look all that impressive on a box score, but he’s OKC’s defensive stopper and could cause havoc for guards like Stephen Curry or Manu Ginobli. On an offensively-minded team, Sefolosha brings the balance.</p>\n<p>Down low, Serge Ibaka is the big force for the Thunder. Extremely athletic, Ibaka has averaged 13.5 points and 3.5 blocks per game in the playoffs. It may be Ibaka that turns out to be the X-factor for OKC as he went off for 17 points in the first victory without Westbrook, but scored just eight in the loss Monday night. The Thunder may have lost a guard, but Ibaka’s production may determine how far the team goes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Oklahoma City Thunder now solely belong to Durant. The player who will finish second in MVP voting averaged an NBA second-best 28.1 points during the regular season. During the playoffs, Durant has only improved those numbers, averaging 33.0 points, 5.8 assists and 8.0 boards per contest as well as 48.8 shooting from the field. Without Westbrook, Durant will be the glaring focus for the other team, but so far he’s responded, dropping nearly 40 points in the two games without Westbrook.</p>\n<p>For Durant, it’s time to step up and put the team on his back. That’s what the best players do. If he wants to prove he should’ve been a true candidate for the MVP, this is the time. It’s his team and his chance to shine.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma City may be facing adversity, but now it has some extra motivation to make it back to the NBA finals. They’ll be playing with Westbrook in mind. Never doubt a team with something to prove.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Minchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51117\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51117\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/","id":3193,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3192,3191,3190],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
