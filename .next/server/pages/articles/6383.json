Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant. However, when giving oral sex all eyes are completely on you. In most cases, if someone isn’t nutting it’s pretty easy to find who’s to blame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, tackling my first dick seemed like a daunting task. So, I approached the situation with the intensity that my type-A personality demands and decided to hit the books. This came in the form of an in-depth tutorial from one of my close friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She sat me down and demonstrated the proper positioning, motions, etc. on a hairbrush handle. In my case, not knowing what exactly to expect was what was causing the majority of my anxiety. After receiving explicit instructions, I felt better prepared to explore this unknown territory. I realized that I wasn’t nervous about the actual act of giving a blowjob per se, but more that I couldn’t imagine how the events might unfold in my head because I had absolutely no concept of what was going to happen. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt lucky that I had a friend I trusted who was willing to educate me on the subject.

I found out that many girls did not receive the thorough education I thought was necessary for success. Most girls simply repeated the golden rule: no teeth. But other than that, most advice was to “just kinda go for it.” When they reflected on their experiences, the consensus seemed to be that they didn’t believe this lack of education hindered their ability to perform or caused them any more anxiety than normal during their first experience. Personally, I think hindsight blurs the anxiety they felt preceding the act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued the conversation with my blowjob virgin friends, who all agreed that receiving a thorough how-to walkthrough would significantly decrease their anxiety. Most of these girls told me that they had gleaned what little knowledge they had from brief conversations with friends, or from articles in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the like. We discussed the merits of these articles and they told me how they didn’t feel like they could trust the information between the glossy pages of a national magazine when performing such an intimate act. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional sex is a team sport, as it fosters a “we’re all in this together” sort of camaraderie that takes some of the pressure off each individual participant.

Sex is such a popular topic in our culture; it’s used in advertisements to sell products, it’s shown in movies and music videos, it’s discussed in the media, news and politics. But amidst all this, there’s so little discussion about sex that occurs outside of heterosexual penetrative acts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly about the details of oral sex, or sex that falls outside of the heterosexual binary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this lack of information fueling a culture which shames these acts? After considering all of the knowledge gained from examining my own experiences, discussing the experiences of others, and pondering how our society educates the masses on this topic, I’ve come to the conclusion that the fear women feel in performing oral sex comes from a culture of embarrassment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think women should be proud of their ability to please their partner. Maybe by owning the power we wield in our positions as blowjob-givers, women will be better able to share their confidence and knowledge with those coming next. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*wink wink*</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie Offerman thinks women should share their experiences to create a new generation of epic blowjob givers. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/just-the-tips-how-to-give-blowjobs-that-dont-suck/","id":6383,"author":{"id":782,"name":"Jackie Offerman"},"related":[6382,6381,6380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":782,"name":"Jackie Offerman","biography":"Not available","articles":[6383],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Some Fruit Just Shouldn’t Be Labeled:  Why You Can’t Name, Frame or Slap a Sticker on Sexuality","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This week I think I’ll talk rather seriously about labels, how stupid I think they are and the definition of sexuality.

If we’re going to continue with our maniacal categorization of people, then we need to create a separate category for every single member of the human race.</p>\n<p>Much like every other aspect of human nature, sexuality can be fluid. At any one time somebody might find themselves on a different point on the sexual spectrum than when they checked the day before. Just as there are infinite decimal numbers between zero and one, there are infinite points on the sexual spectrum that can be felt by any one individual, and whatever point you find yourself resting on might not be the point your circumstances leave you standing on when your life ends.</p>\n<p>I never thought I’d find an example case in a modern hip-hop artist, but Frank Ocean’s coming out a few months ago yields a perfect one.</p>\n<p>NPR published an article on the importance of his letter, in which he details his romance with a man from his young adulthood. In his letter, addressed to the world, Ocean doesn’t label himself as gay or even as bisexual. He instead allows the nature of his sexuality to remain malleable and indefinable as far as the reader is concerned, and that’s exactly the way it should be. The NPR article states, in a way I find appropriately succinct:</p>\n<p>“Ocean’s [letter] presented sexuality as something that arises within particular circumstances, defined by shifting desire and individual encounters rather than solidifying as an identity.”</p>\n<p>So I guess the next time somebody asks me if I’m gay, I’ll just smile at them and tell them that the nature of my sexuality is in a constant state of flux and I resist the urge to label myself as anything definite. Or maybe I’ll just tell them I’m human. Or maybe I’ll just tell them it doesn’t matter because who I fall in love with or who I take to bed is not my whole identity; it is but a fleeting and indefinable aspect of everything that makes me who I am.

I hope you were all sufficiently sloshed on New Years. As I shamefully wasted an opportunity to make countless “Santa’s sack” jokes for the Christmas holiday, and instead chose to rant about tits, I feel I must take this opportunity to respectfully nod in the direction of the new year and, by default, resolutions.</p>\n<p>Obviously there is the standard of “lose weight,” and “eat right,” which we all know only last for the first week of January. Mine personally is to become a Renaissance woman (start beekeeping, own a motorcycle, have an appreciation for opera). But on top of our personal resolutions, let’s take a moment to make a resolution or two for our sex lives. There is always room for improvement! Without further adieu, I present to you your sexual resolutions for 2013 (*waves hand grandly in arc*).</p>\n<p>1.

You would think never, but hey, as I said, that’s college for you. Don’t look back on your college days without anything wild and crazy to show for. Eventually your firm skin and taught bellies will degrade into soft decline (depending whether or not you make it past the first week of January). Better get it while it’s hot.</p>\n<p>2. Not With Your Ex:</p>\n<p>Come on. It’s a new year, new conquests! Christmas break is for what I like to call “The Great Purge.” No, this is not in reference to consuming mass quantities of food, becoming shamefully opulent and then attempting to rid thyself of all the late night feasting. By this I mean you have three weeks to submerge yourself in your friends and family, and all that is most important. During this time, you utterly ignore thoughts of any member of the opposite sex who has been getting your panties in a bunch. You may find, as I have, that a number of people who have been occupying your romantic sphere are tolerated rather than actually liked. So purge them out of your system and enjoy the other flavors.</p>\n<p>3. Be Kinkier:</p>\n<p>I am the fondest spokeswoman of this cause. What I love about kinky sex is that it takes sex and makes it new again. What happened to that breathless thrill, that burning feeling of sex being delightfully taboo? Due to its rampant nature in Isla Vista, often the act becomes the norm, the everyday, typical. Spontaneously nip their shoulder. Cover her mouth when she gets loud while simultaneously licking her ear. Tug on his hair. Order them around. Tie her up. See? Feeling the burn already.</p>\n<p>4. Don’t be afraid to ask:</p>\n<p>This, above all else, baffles me. Why would you not want to get what you want? By guiding them you are almost guaranteed your proper pleasure. And lord knows they appreciate it. Insert Helen Keller joke here. Many are afraid to say what they want because they don’t know want to ruin the moment. Depending on what appeals more to you, your options are as such: a) physical cues (put their hands where you want them and move them as you desire) b) turn your breathy moan into purring instruction or c) deliver a dominant command: if not properly carried out, punishment is in store.</p>\n<p>5. Get flexible:</p>\n<p>I was stretching at the gym today when it occurred to me: many people lack the ability to touch their toes. And if they can’t touch their toes, I’m going to follow the logical flow of progression in that they can’t put aforementioned toes behind their head. Which is a shame, as it is a personal favorite of mine. By lacking a limber body, you may be more limited in the things you can try. You might also suffer as I have and get awful sex cramps in a tight muscle. Fight the battle before it comes to your door. Weeping is generally a turn off.</p>\n<p>6. Do it in new fun places:</p>\n<p>Out of all places, I mean the library. I want to shag amongst the shelves of academia, toppling tomes in frenzied passion. You’d be lying if you said you hadn’t thought about it. Now, unfortunately, my fantasies always end in the shelves toppling over and resulting in the ultimate ruin of the sixth floor, but that’s just my thought process. There are boundless nooks and crannies to explore your companion’s nooks and crannies. In general, don’t limit yourself to the bed; it’s so… white bread. Take your Lusty Lewis on an expedition into the world of sexual locale (yes I am trying to turn Lewis and Clarke into a sexual metaphor. The break was too long). Fond examples of mine, proven to be delightful: the shower, the floor, the dresser, the kitchen island, the ledge next to my sink, the beach, in a parking structure… you understand. It imbues your actions with a restless sense of desperation; you must have them on the closest available surface at this very moment. Focusing specifically on shower sex, this is a unanimous favorite. Hot water pouring down your body, you’re both wet and instead of cuddling after you connect via loofa.</p>\n<p>7. Try new positions:</p>\n<p>Missionary is a safe, successful position, but please do not only use the missionary position. Other positions can boast better angles, sensations or visuals. Try something new. Just don’t be that guy who has to pull out every move to show he knows where the clitoris is.</p>\n<p>8. Learn where the clitoris is.</p>\n<p>9. Have sex with the lights on:</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to see the person you’ve gone home with, you shouldn’t be going home with them. Look at your shame. Besides, much of arousal comes from visual cues. Not getting to see all the little details like lip biting or eyes squeezed closed detracts from the experience.</p>\n<p>10. Demand your orgasms:</p>\n<p>For too long, women have dealt with not getting theirs. Just because women don’t shoot fireworks from their hoo-ha to let you know the deed has been done, doesn’t mean that you’re free to stop whenever. If we can breathe through our noses while resisting the urge to gag, in the name of reciprocity, we should at least get our fair share. I’ll admit, I’ll often just deal because I don’t want to turn the sexual experience into a tyrannical affair, but no longer! A solid way to ensure this is to enforce a strict “ladies first” policy.</p>\n<p>All right, there’s your list! Apply as one would a soothing balm to the wounds of your sexual past. Happy Humping and bang in the New Year right!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. often thinks about sex at the gym – she’s the one with her feet behind her head and a smirk on her face.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49247\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49247\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/grab-2013-balls-sexual-musts-2013-bangin/","id":6381,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6380,6379,6378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nice Guys Don’t Finish Last.
