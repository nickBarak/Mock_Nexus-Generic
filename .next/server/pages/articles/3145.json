It’s the points system.</p>\n<p>At first glance, rotisserie play seems to be designed to make fantasy owners pull out their hair in blind fury just so the good people at ESPN can share a malicious smirk in between talking about Brett Favre for no reason and making fun of the Oakland Raiders. <span>[media-credit id=20135 align=”aligncenter” width=”150″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/marlins2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-37289\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/marlins2-150x250.jpg?resize=150%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-37289\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A closer inspection, however, reveals that there actually is a somewhat coherent method to ESPN’s scoring system. In rotisserie play, you gain points based on how well you do in the various scoring categories compared to the rest of the teams in your league. If you do better in a category than your opponents, you gain points. If you do worse, you lose points. How you rank in the individual categories also affects how you obtain points. For instance, if you are ranked No. 1 in a certain category, you won’t gain any points for doing well in that category because you’re already ranked first. You can’t do any better in that category.</p>\n<p>While fair to those with good players and a balanced team, the system can make those owners who rely heavily on either pitching or hitting see red.</p>\n<p>Take my team for example. My pitching is absolutely outstanding. Marlins pitcher Josh Johnson is the Gandalf of the MLB with his absurdly low 0.65 WHIP and the Phillies’ Roy Halladay has humiliated hitters whenever he takes the mound. The rest of my staff — which includes Red Sox ace Jon Lester and Padres’ closer Heath Bell — isn’t too shabby either.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum is my hitting. It’s not that I have bad hitters. My team includes Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, Arizona shortstop Stephen Drew and third baseman David Freese of the Cardinals. However, the rest of my lineup has begun the season mired in a slump. While I am first or near first in every pitching category, I’m wallowing near the bottom of most hitting categories. Logic would say that my outstanding pitching would at least counter my tear-inducing hitting, but logic would be wrong.</p>\n<p>Because my pitching is so good, it is almost impossible for me gain points from it since I’m already beating the rest of the league in those categories.  Even if I get three wins and 20 strikeouts on any given day, it won’t matter. It’s like being the person who sets the curve on a test. You don’t really benefit because you would have gotten the top grade anyway. The only way I can really gain points is through my hitting, since that is where I have room to improve. But since my hitting sucks so much right now, I rarely ever do better than the people ahead of me in the standings and I rarely ever gain enough points to move up. It’s like ESPN is punishing me for being so awesome at drafting pitchers.</p>\n<p>In fantasy baseball, being the best is bad unless you’re the best at everything (but we all know that’s not true, because if you were you wouldn’t be reading this). If you’re mediocre at everything, then you have both the potential and the capacity to improve as the season goes on. However, if you are the best in a few categories and horrible in others, you are likely going to be stuck in the middle of the pack for the entirety of the season. You won’t quite have the worst team in the league, but having one of the best teams will always be slightly out of your reach.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s good to be bad sometimes. I know its counterintuitive, but just look at George Thorogood. That dude is bad to the bone, but he has tons of money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She hopes to use her experience to host events like these and make students aware of the resources available to them on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caughman echoed a similar goal for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we wanted to do something to reduce food waste,” Caughman said. “Through our research, we found that a leading cause of food waste stems from the food in circulation not being distributed efficiently, so we decided to survey UCSB students to see how much they knew about the A.S. Food Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey results showed that many people were unaware of the A.S. Food Bank (A.S. FB)  or found it to be inaccessible to them. This gave the team the idea to bring the A.S. Food Bank to the people, in one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus during one of the busiest times of the day, according to Caughman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was deemed a success by the team, with 53 students receiving free groceries from the pop-up event in the one hour they were open.

However, the board concluded business after deliberations and allocations with $25,253 remaining.<br>\nINDUS, a student group dedicated to educating others about South Asian culture, received partial funding for requests made at last night’s meeting. According to event organizers, the organization is planning an event honoring Buddha Purnima, a religious and cultural holiday that commemorates the life, death and enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. </p>\n<p>INDUS social chair Natasha Sidhu, a second-year biopsychology major, said INDUS needed funding for transportation so that students could attend the off-campus celebration.</p>\n<p>“We have been talking to a lot of people and many are interested, this is a really big event,” Sidhu said. “Most of the cabinet members have cars and we would be able to coordinate rides for people. Rides should not be an issue for this event.”</p>\n<p>Board members questioned whether the event was designed to be accessible to UCSB undergraduates.</p>\n<p>“The issue this board has with the event is that it is not local, which makes it inaccessible to non-members,” board member Josue Aparicio said.</p>\n<p>However, board member Alexandra Onodera said providing financial support for transportation would in fact make the event more open to the student body.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that the off-campus issue should be an issue,” Onodera said. “They have assured us that people are going to have rides, and as a member of this board and this community, I am going to believe what they tell us.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually allocated $2,175 of INDUS’ original $2,675 request.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Interfraternity President Ernest Walker, a third-year political science major, requested funding to publish the Greek Brochure, a mailer that will be sent to incoming freshman and transfer students to inform them about the greek community.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t get funded, it won’t go out,” Walker said. “This shows all the good things that we do, all of the community service hours. The greek system has a bad rap and this is a way to get students talking about Greek Life.”</p>\n<p>According to board member Stephanie Finch, the brochure was not financed in past years because it was considered a reckless use of student fees.</p>\n<p>“I think that if any other organization came to us to send material home to students that are already coming here, we would not fund them,” Finch said. “This is not even outreach because these students are already coming here.”</p>\n<p>The board ultimately decided to reject the funding request.</p>\n<p>Board members also fully-funded Born Again Ministries, Naked Voices and Burning Skirts Women’s Ultimate Frisbee Team, while partially funding Real Life and the Chican@ Latina@ Graduation Committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-18/finance-board-holds-final-discussion-year/","id":3143,"author":{"id":222,"name":"Veronica Smith"},"related":[3142,3141,3140],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"BSU Releases Demands to Address Black Student Resources and Success","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2018-10-17-at-3.05.36-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2018-10-17-at-3.05.36-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"BSU released a set of demands on Feb. 8 for the university to fulfill.

The most recent demands aim to address “structural hindrances on the development of Black UCSB students,” according to the list of demands authored by the BSU Demands Team.</p>\n<p>“Black students must continually fight to have their humanity recognized and appreciated, which takes time away from students’ abilities to study, learn and become wholly involved as campus community members,” the team wrote in the demands list.</p>\n<p>The demands team argued that the university’s lack of effort to improve the conditions of black students on campus has required that BSU members and the black student community consistently advocate for black students, according to the demands list. To alleviate this, BSU demands institutional changes they said would provide a reliable source of advocacy for black students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The University has continually been unable to fulfill Black students’ demands without the intervention of Black students on campus who address this inability,” the demands team wrote.</p>\n<p>“The University’s reliance on Black student intervention in what should be structured efforts to support Black students is unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>The Feb. 8 demands include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creation of an Office of Black Student Development “to support the Black experience at UCSB.” The office would include eight paid positions and would provide “resources, advocate for and help create a positive learning environment” for black students in addition to building a “sense of belonging” to bolster the academic success of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of a Director of Black Student Development, who would advocate for black students on campus and keep the university “accountable to Black students and Black student development.”</li>\n<li>The implementation of two academic support counselors dedicated to addressing the academic achievement needs of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of a recruitment and retention specialist to “ensure that the University is … recruiting more Black students in order to increase our Black student population” and to focus on Black student retention. The specialist would also focus on “creating a livable environment for Black people.”</li>\n<li>The implementation of a coordinator of black student life, who would specialize in the social and extracurricular activities and opportunities of black students.</li>\n<li>The implementation of two advocacy counselors tasked with identifying the current challenges that black students face at UCSB and working to resolve those issues and help black students achieve their goals.</li>\n<li>The creation of a building on campus, which would be named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development.”  It would be solely dedicated to black students and would be a commemoration to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/\">North Hall Takeover of 1968</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BSU estimates the total cost of the demands to be about $900,000 and requires that this money be provided permanently by the chancellor’s office, as opposed to the Division of Student Affairs, and be allocated by February of 2021.</p>\n<p>BSU also demands that the construction of the Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development begin within the same two-year period. This demand for a building for black students on campus was part of the 1968 demands set forth by BSU members during the North Hall Takeover.</p>\n<p>“We believe that it is time that the University fulfill the commitments that it has claimed to have made to Black students throughout the course of the last 50 years. We want the entire campus community to know and hear clearly our struggle. We refuse to wait any longer,” the demands team wrote.</p>\n<p>BSU met with Chancellor Henry T. Yang and other top administrators on Friday to present and discuss BSU’s demands.</p>\n<p>Yang said he is willing to work with students in creating Office of Black Student Development in a statement he sent to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“I am supportive of the vision for an Office of Black Student Development, and have been working with students, faculty, and administrative colleagues to ensure that progress is made toward the first steps of planning for the establishment of such a significant resource,” Yang wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>The demands and information about the meeting were emailed to <i>Nexus </i>on Feb. 9. In that email, BSU expressed “frustrations” about an incident that had happened during the meeting.</p>\n<p>According to the email, Maria Herrera-Sobek, associate vice chancellor of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion, made “disturbing and insulting” comments which “belittle[d] the struggle of Black UCSB students and Black people by minimizing the Black identity as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While discussing BSU’s demands, Herrera-Sobek reportedly expressed her discontent with a previous black administrator, who she felt centered efforts on the black student community and lacked attention toward the Chicanx and Latinx student community, the email stated.</p>\n<p>Herrera-Sobek also reportedly said during the meeting that she would have hoped the administrator spent more time focused on the Hispanic student community, adding that, “[W]e are all African,” according to the email.</p>\n<p>“Black students across the board continue to be undervalued and underserved at an institutional level within university systems,” BSU wrote in the email.</p>\n<p>“Our meeting [on Friday] proved how ignorant our own administration is to the plights of Black students.”</p>\n<p>Herrera-Sobek said she apologized to the BSU members for the effects that her comments had in the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I have communicated to the students that I deeply regret the remarks that caused them discomfort and made them feel marginalized,” Herrera-Sobek wrote in an email sent to the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>“I hope to have the opportunity for further dialogue with the students and to continue to find ways for my office and the university to support their needs and to address their pressing concerns.”</p>\n<p>BSU said Herrera-Sobek’s behavior during the meeting was an “iteration of anti-Blackness” on behalf of the university, and something they said is familiar to the experiences of black students at UCSB and other schools such as <a href=\"https://www.independent.com/news/2019/jan/25/protests-against-racism-santa-barbara-city-college/\">Santa Barbara City College</a> and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-cal-poly-racism-20180425-story.html\">California Polytechnic State University</a>.</p>\n<p>“It was troublesome for us to hear an administrator whose position is explicitly and solely dedicated to diversity and equity on campus use such apparent anti-Black rhetoric,” BSU wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>A copy of the demands in full can be read below: <object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Demands-Office-of-BSD-Statement-pdf.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Demands-Office-of-BSD-Statement-pdf.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:30 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
