In January 2018, it became legal to both sell and tax the sales of marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, “Where’s the pot?” Christian Alonso, field director of the Santa Barbara Young Democrats asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two and a half year mark approaches since the passage of Prop 64, Santa Barbara has yet to see it’s first recreational dispensary. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/news/2018/jul/10/three-pot-shops-get-green-light-santa-barbara/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, three recreational cannabis dispensaries were authorized early last year to open in Santa Barbara city. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hear loud and clear that folks in Isla Vista want a dispensary in Isla Vista, and that makes sense, you don’t want the purchasing power of Isla Vistans to be sent out of Isla Vista where none of the tax revenue or benefit will go to I.V.,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams went on to address how taxed marijuana proceeds would go toward hiring marijuana regulation employees, such as law enforcement and ad commissioners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After speaking to a consultant, they speculate we could make between 5 and 25 million dollars a year,” Williams said. “This taxed money is collected by Santa Barbara County  and would go back to funding the people and not the government itself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prop 64 elicits specific </span><a href=\"https://dispensarypermits.com/united-states-marijuana-dispensary-laws/open-a-dispensary-in-california/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that must be followed when establishing a retail dispensary. For example, dispensaries must be at least 600 feet from any school (K-12), daycare or youth center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams speculated I.V. would receive a recreational dispensary, but the location must be precise due to youth centers like UCSB’s Children’s Center and I.V. Elementary School.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have more plans for retail, we are just trying to figure out how that’s going to work,” Lavagnino said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People still have really strong feelings about it, it’s like navigating a public minefield,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballotpedia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 57 percent of Californians voted yes to Prop 64 in 2016, which allowed recreational marijuana use for those over the age of 21. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Legalizing marijuana is more ethical than buying it off the black market,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federally, marijuana is still </span><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">classified</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is addictive with no medical value. This places it in the same category as cocaine and methamphetamines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A regime which uplifts, reforms and permits the best of the operations and crushes the worst is what we want. The potential of hurting the cartel with legalization is something really powerful,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s all about tracking and trace of custody, we want people to know where their marijuana will be coming from.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continued to discuss how a retail store is much safer than many of the commonly offered marijuana delivery services, because they can be regulated and tracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are some things that are really bad about marijuana. For example, it affects your level of motivation. But compared to other medications like opiates, there is no comparison,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the drug becomes progressively more available, Williams and Lavagnino suspect that a lot of marijuana’s negative stigma will begin to fade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll just take time and exposure,” Lavagnino said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/","id":3715,"author":{"id":254,"name":"Cristian Loza"},"related":[3714,3713,3712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":254,"name":"Cristian Loza","biography":"Not available","articles":[3715,3993],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Proposed Vending Machine in I.V.

CSD, expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” </span>Leonard<em> Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vending machine is intended to operate 24/7 and will likely be located outside the Isla Vista Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to Sir. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Sir said the roughly $14,000 refrigerated vending machine will be built by VendTek, a vending machine company that helps that allows customers to purchase items through a variety of different payment methods, according to the company’s </span><a href=\"https://www.vendtek.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir specifically picked VendTek because it would allow for qualified, low-income students’ perm numbers to be uploaded to the vending machine — all they would have to do is swipe their access card. For Santa Barbara City College and non-student low-income residents, Sir said VendTek will provide specially-made cards with barcodes so they can access the vending machine as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, Sir planned to have the vending machine stationed on campus, but, after working with UC Santa Barbara administration, she was informed that it would conflict with the school’s “vending machine contracts,” forcing her to take the project off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” However, Sir said the new vending machine will acquire food in a similar manner by obtaining “pre-made, unsold food items.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Bider, a third-year environmental studies major, worked with Sir to help find potential sources for food donations. Bider originally canvassed local restaurants such as Bagel Cafe, Buddha Bowls, Cajé, Woodstocks and Pizza My Heart to gauge their interest in donating to a food pantry. He assumed they would also express interest in donating to a vending machine with similar goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also reached out to the local Trader Joe’s and Amazon outlets, both of which expressed interest in making food donations in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir noted that “about 48% of UCSB undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed do not have a consistent source of high-quality, nutritious food.” When food pantries are closed, usually around 7 p.m. at the latest, there is nowhere else to obtain a free meal either on campus or in I.V., according to Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir believes the vending machine will also benefit students struggling with housing security, as some students do not have access to a dedicated kitchen to cook meals.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure proper health regulations when serving the repackaged food, Sir reached out to Kendra Wise, an environmental health specialist from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we are not profiting from this vending machine, we can register as a non-profit organization that’s distributing food.  [Wise] recommends that people who are going to help us get their training online to be able to handle this food and repackage it,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of our budget includes all the regulations of what we need to handle this food, and I will be working with Kendra Wise to make sure that this food will fit the Santa Barbara County health regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir placed heavy emphasis on the proposed vending machine’s location, because, unlike on-campus options such as the A.S. Food Bank, the vending machine will be open to non-student residents in I.V. — the only one of its kind.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 20, 10:56 a.m.]: A previous version of this article wrongly stated the vending machine would be purchased through the company VendTech, but has been corrected to the right company, VendTek. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
