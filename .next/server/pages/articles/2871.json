There are defenses out there that have had better individual fantasy days, but few units have been as consistent as this one. The Titans defense has had only two single-digit fantasy outings, and with veteran players like linebacker Will Witherspoon and cornerback Cortland Finnegan leading the defense, that trend is going to continue.</p>\n<p>Best Tight End: Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers.</p>\n<p>There isn’t anything you can say about this guy that hasn’t been said. Gates has been hauling in touchdowns for the Chargers since 2003, and in a year when the 3-5 Chargers can’t get anything going, he has not slowed down. He has nine touchdowns and only one game without one, and has gotten his fantasy owners 15+ points in five of eight games. He currently has no equal at the position.</p>\n<p>Best Wide Receiver: Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions.</p>\n<p>It’s between him and Falcons wide receiver Roddy White, but in the end it came down to the fact that Johnson has maintained All-Pro numbers with Shaun Hill running the offense. Now that Matthew Stafford is back from injury, Johnson is going to be unstoppable. Fantasy owners got a taste of what is to come with Sunday’s 101-yard, three-touchdown performance. That’s only the beginning. All hail Megatron.</p>\n<p>Best Running Back: Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>In a world in which Chris Johnson was drafted first, Adrian Peterson is king. After a rather lackluster opening game, Peterson returned to form with a vengeance in week two and since then has continued to prove why he is the best at what he does, which is making defenders look like they just got promoted from Pop Warner. With three 130+ yard rushing days and four 20+ fantasy point days, Peterson has certainly outplayed the inconsistent Johnson, and has been the only bright spot on a dismal Vikings offense.</p>\n<p>Best Quarterback: Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts.</p>\n<p>Numbers don’t lie. Manning has tossed 15 touchdowns to just two interceptions, and has thrown for fewer than 300 yards in just three games. No other quarterback has played nearly as well and it’s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>Biggest Surprise: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the offense in week three, Fitzy has averaged 19.6 points per game, which is better than quarterbacks such as Matt Schaub, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, and Joe Flacco over the same period of time. Now I don’t know what kind of deal Fitzy had to make with the devil to be able to do what he’s doing, but it was definitely worth it. The 0-7 Bills still have no hope of a playoff spot, but Fitzy has given the fantasy world a Bills player worth starting. That’s surprising enough on its own.</p>\n<p>Biggest Letdown (a.k.a. the Jamarcus Russell Award): Brett Favre, QB, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>No one was surprised when Favre announced that he was coming back after almost leading the Vikings to a Superbowl just last season, and fantasy owners had good reason to believe that he would be able to, if not duplicate exactly, at least come close to his numbers from last season. However, it would appear that age has finally caught up with Favre, who has managed just one double-digit fantasy day while leading the Vikings to a 2-5 record thus far. You should have stayed retired, Brett.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg receives the award for best unsolicited fantasy football advice given by any UCSB student named Joshua Greenberg.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/","id":2871,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2870,2869,2868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Deity of the Ice: Beating the Shit Out of People … for Good Reason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s one misconception about hockey that bugs me.

The desire to scrap is usually signified visually by a shaking of the gloves and verbally by an overt challenge, such as, “Want to go?” Once a player drops the gloves, he is considered the instigator.</p>\n<p>The player who steps in to defend his teammate risks initiating a fight with a dance partner who isn’t willing. It’s frowned upon to throw a cheap shot and refuse to fight afterward.</p>\n<p>To go after someone and start pounding on them can get the aggressor kicked out of the game and result in a penalty for instigating. Despite this punishment, players who stick up for their teammates are highly respected, even if the player who threw the cheap hit doesn’t consent. If that player does consent to defend himself and can hold his own, he gains a bit of respect, although it’s generally not enough to offset the cheap hit.</p>\n<p>Most talented players don’t fight on a regular basis. Usually, when a skilled player is about to get involved in an altercation, one of the scrappier players on the roster will step in and put himself at risk. It may seem like a puss move by the more talented player, but the hierarchy demands this type of sacrifice from certain players on the roster.</p>\n<p>There are exceptions in the hierarchy. Some skilled players are willing to take matters into their own hands. But for elite athletes who make millions of dollars expected to contribute in other areas, fighting is an unnecessary medical risk. A broken hand can sideline a player for a month, while a concussion from getting knocked out can derail an entire career.</p>\n<p>In fact, many players are just on the roster for scrapping ability and continuously have to fight to maintain their status as valuable members of the team. Most teams have a heavyweight for this purpose. Heavyweights are categorized as such because of their size and fighting ability.</p>\n<p>Consider Deryk Engelland, standing 6’2” and weighing 202 pounds. He’s a small side heavyweight. Consider Derek Boogaard, standing at 6’7” and about 275 pounds. He’s the biggest.</p>\n<p>Mike Tyson in his prime clocked in at around 6’0”, 220 pounds. Having a monster like Boogaard on your team, even on the bench, discourages opposing players from taking liberties with your team for fear of retribution. It’s not necessary that they play to be effective.</p>\n<p>In cases of retribution or personal vendettas, things can get downright nasty, with guys continuing to go at each other after the zebras try to step in, fighting strictly to injure. In a scrap between enforcers, when the refs come in to break things up, accomplished fighters will give each other a nod or a tap to signify a “good fight.” There is always a certain level of respect that must be maintained.</p>\n<p>Fighting is a worst-case scenario, but it has a time and place in the sport. To create or swing momentum, rather than taking themselves off the ice for five minutes to serve a fighting penalty, players would do better to throw a crushing hit. But those opportunities occur infrequently, and chasing after that big hit can create scoring chances for the other team, so sometimes fighting is the only way to right the ship and get back on track. To get back at a team for a hit, it would be more effective to score a few goals and get retribution with a win, but guys don’t think logically when their teammates get hit hard, particularly when an injury occurs.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the gloves just have to drop.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Hockey columnist Josh Deitell wishes he were 6’7”, 275.

Given the fact that the Yankees are officially out of the hunt for October (or now, November?), it is time to make some moves. One such move that the Yankees should not make is unloading the Jeter. And yes, he is THE Jeter, mainly because of all he has done for the most storied franchise in MLB history.</p>\n<p>“Derek is a lot like Cal [Ripken] because he represents all that our society aspires to be and what our game aspires to be. He takes his job seriously. He goes to work everyday and he does it with pride for his franchise and for his city.” This quote is from Brian Cashman, general manager of the Yankees, who has Jeter’s destiny in the palms of his 2010 World Series ring-less hands. Jeter has always represented everything that a “Yankee” should. In the truest sense of the word, a “yankee” is a slang term for an American. Amongst other traits, being an American involves being proud, determined, optimistic, resilient, classy and powerful.  Throughout his years, Derek has been all of the above, and more.</p>\n<p>Mr. November, Mr. October, Captain Clutch, DJ — call him what you want, but he will always be the constant professional, a sort of golden pillar others try to measure up to. You cannot blame my love for the man; everyone else feels the same. There exists countless quotes from fans of all types, including Michael Jordan, Daryl Strawberry and Mr. October himself, Reggie Jackson, singing his praises. His work ethic is unparalleled. Jeter has been working overtime since he was a kid in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was named High School Player of the Year while owning a .600 batting average, to his home in the Bronx, where he is looking to ring in another year in pinstripes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As I touched on in my earlier column, Jeter’s skills are fading. In fact, this past year has been his worst in almost all facets of the game — batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and even fielding. You know what I say? Big deal, it happens to everyone. ESPN’s Major League Baseball resident expert, Tim Kurkjian, has reported that Jeter has been reaching out to various hitting and fielding coaches to help him change up his game, utilizing the strengths he has left, and hiding the weaknesses. This is what all the greats have had to do, for example, with Jordan turning into a post-up player instead of a one-on-one face-up master.</p>\n<p>The thing is Derek doesn’t need to pull in the huge bucks in regards to his salary. He is the only player in baseball who pulls in $9 million on the reg with his endorsements with Gatorade, Nike, Ford Motors and Gillette. He doesn’t exactly need the $22 million annually he is receiving from the Steinbrenners. What Derek Jeter needs, and what the rest of America wants, is for him to keep wearing those pinstripes. It goes best with his sparkling white teeth.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus MLB columnist Julia Speace is a little biased because she likes her men tall, dark and handsome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/speaces-pieces-jeter/","id":2870,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2869,2868,2867],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
