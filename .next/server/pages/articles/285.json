I’ve been injured the last two years, and Regionals are a big deal,” team captain Jill Damion said. “People are looking to get ranked and go play in the NCAA National Tournament. And that’s what I’m looking to do. I love big tournaments. That’s when I play my best. It should be fun.”</p>\n<p>All four women will compete in both the singles and doubles championships, with Lozano pairing up with Dockendorf and Damion with Meehan. The winners from each championship will advance to the 2010 USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, which takes place in Flushing, New York from Nov. 4 to Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>“Jordan has a history of playing big against big players. She’s not intimidated,” Coach Kirkwood said. “She’s a banger. She’s got a chance to get hot and put pressure on her opponent.”</p>\n<p>Coming off the UCSB Classic, the Gauchos look to improve with each tournament during the fall season. With the exception of highly recruited freshman Kiersten Meehan from Monte Sereno, CA, experience will play a large factor in this tournament, which is usually dominated by the Pac-10.</p>\n<p>“Natalia Lozano is probably playing the best on our squad right now,” Coach Kirkwood said. “She’s improved every year, and so far this year she’s showing signs of that same kind of leap. She’s got a big game. She strikes the ball as good as anybody.”</p>\n<p>UCSB women’s tennis managed to win a couple big matches in last years ITA Southwest Regional, despite failing to advance in either championship bracket. Lozano will try to avenge a tough third-round ousting in this year’s tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been playing against each other for the past three weeks. It will be good to play outside competition,” Lozano said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still awaiting the return of First Team All-Conference Sofia Novak, who is currently studying abroad in Spain.

\r\n</script> \n<p>CSUN, currently tied with UC Irvine for seventh, is hoping to end its four game skid. Sitting at 8-11 and 1-4 in conference play, the Matadors’ matchup versus UCSB will be the second of their four game home stand.</p>\n<p>There is a current total of three Gauchos that average 10 points per game. One of them is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, who serves as the team’s focal point in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>Leading the Big West in field goal percentage with a 57.6 overall average, and has been even more efficient during UCSB’s conference schedule, making a huge improvement to 65.1 percent. Helping create high percentage shots has been her ability to rebound the ball as well. During conference play, she is tied for third in rebounds per game at 8.4.</p>\n<p>Edelman has increased her endurance to be able to produce when called upon, ranking second in minutes per game with a 37.4 average during the conference slate.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s post player is coming off her highest point total in a conference game thus far of 19 points. Over the course of both the non-conference and conference schedules combined, Edelman leads the team in games with at least 10 points at 11.</p>\n<p>It can be expected that Edelman will face one of her toughest matchups in the paint this Wednesday as she will battle it out with sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>After an exceptional freshman season, in which she was named the Big West Freshman of the Year and became the first rookie to be a First Team All-Big West selection since 2002, Fluker remains within the top ranks of post players in the conference.</p>\n<p>Averaging 15.2 points and 10 rebounds per game, Fluker is currently the only player in the Big West to average a double-double in any statistical category. Her rebounds per game average ranks 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation. Her 206 total rebounds is the most in league play so far this season and has helped the Matadors gain their conference leading average of 42.6 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She is a proven rim protector, owning a conference leading 2.2 blocks per game average. Her current total of 42 blocks, which leads all Big West players, has already surpassed her total of 35 in her first year.</p>\n<p>Although CSUN was swept in both of its games against the Gauchos last season, Fluker made her presence felt in game two of the series with a 31-point performance.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Matadors’ gameplan revolves around Fluker, so the Gauchos will look to contain her presence in the interior, but still must remain aware of the three-point shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. Maulupe’s 40.5 three-point percentage ranks sixth in the Big West, while 47 three-point makes is second.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has been consistent with its perimeter defense, ranking third overall in three-point defense at 28.7 percent. They also are second in scoring defense, allowing 63.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal State Northridge will face each this Wednesday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/","id":282,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[281,280,279],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Loses Big at Home Versus CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite hanging in tough in the first half, the Gauchos were eventually blown off their home court by the Matadores losing 78-57 and falling to 1-5 in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team just could not quite hold off the CSUN Matadors on Wednesday, losing at home 78-57.

\r\n</script> \n<p>At the 10-minute mark, halfway through the first half, the score was low, Gauchos leading 15-13. No. 8 UCSB was putting up a formidable fight against No. 4 CSUN. The two teams crawled up the board basket by basket as both forced turnovers and tried to profit from them.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman center Tyler Jackson entered the game at 9:56 in his second-ever court appearance. Within 50 seconds he made a sweet steal, an offensive rebound, and 2-2 foul shots. With UCSB’s usual big players still out, Jackson has had large shoes to fill on the court.</p>\n<p>At 8:38 CSUN redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson made a steal and had a fast break down the court, but he was no match for UCSB senior guard Eric Childress, who took the ball right out of Johnson’s hands, turned around and made a layup, sending Gaucho fans to their feet.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, one of CSUN’s most valued players — redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith — was not making as many moves as expected. Averaging 16.5 points per game in the regular season, he only scored one basket the entire first half.</p>\n<p>On the other half of the court, team leader junior guard Gabe Vincent was on fire, going 4-6 in three-pointers. Dominating the court on defense as well as offense, he managed to put 16 on the board before the half ended and was able to tap into energy the Gauchos so desperately needed.</p>\n<p>This was a historic night for Vincent as well as UCSB basketball. With 4:11 left in the first half, Vincent made his 183rd career three-pointer, passing Gaucho legend Orlando Johnson and becoming number nine on the UCSB all-time top 10 list of three-pointers made. He went on to finish the game with a total of 185 completed threes.</p>\n<p>As the half went on the Gauchos seemed as though they knew what they wanted to do, but just could not get the shot off. Lots of time was spent handing off around the three-point line with few drives, but UCSB held its ground.</p>\n<p>After such an evenly matched half, the last two minutes were startling as the Matadors found their stride. Scoring seven points in one minute, the Matadors flipped a switch and were able to run all over the Gauchos without resistance.</p>\n<p>Aside from two more three-pointers made by Vincent, the Matadors increased their score by 13 points in just over three minutes, leaving a shocking halftime score of 36-32.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the first half, CSUN came out of the gates guns blazing as the second period started. For every shot a Gaucho took, the Matadors took two. All players were playing with heart, but the Matadors were simply moving faster and shooting more accurately.</p>\n<p>With Childress and Vincent missing shot after shot, it was clear the Gauchos had lost their groove and were struggling to pick their heads up. After Vincent’s brilliant first-half performance, going 0-7 in field goals made for a disappointing second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman guard Max Heidegger was a firecracker with impressive ball handling, hard drives and risky but successful shots. He especially shone in the second half when Childress and Vincent seemed burned out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Starting around the 13th minute with a three-pointer from junior guard Michael Warren, the Matadors were able to keep a steady 10-or-more-point lead for the rest of the game. Based on of the level of competition in this first half, this surge from CSUN surprised and devastated Gaucho fans.</p>\n<p>As the second half dragged on and players on both sides of the court continued to get more and more frustrated, the roughness of play also increased. Although CSUN players were on the floor multiple times in the first half, many Gauchos joined them in the second half. They finished the game with 17 Matador fouls and 20 Gaucho fouls.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, both Lubin and Smith dunked in the last five minutes of the game, only furthering the frustration of the home team. Lately the Gauchos have not been able to keep up the energy and precision of play as games wind to an end, a flaw that was unfortunately on display in this most recent game.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Although it was another conference loss piling onto the disappointment of losing at home, the first half of the UCSB-CSUN game gave Gaucho fans hope. The men’s team will have the opportunity to win their first game away when they challenge No. 7 University of Hawaii.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/","id":283,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[282,281,280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Kicks Off Season With Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s tennis opened its 2010-11 season this weekend, hosting the inaugural UCSB Classic.

The tournament featured players from UCSB, Pepperdine, Arizona, BYU, Cal Poly, Denver University and Eastern Washington University.</p>\n<p>After playing well on the first day of the tournament, the Gauchos struggled on Saturday, failing to advance in any main draw matches or first consolation matches. A groin injury forced junior Jill Damion to withdraw from the competition. Her replacement, junior Natalia Lozano, turned in an outstanding performance, winning both of her two set matches.</p>\n<p>“That was great for her,” Head Coach Pete Kirkwood said. “Natalie has been hampered by a bad back. She got more confidence with each set and looked real good by the end of her matches.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Top-seeded sophomore Maria Zalameda defeated Pepperdine teammate junior Ali Walters in the A Flight singles championship 6-7, 6-4 and 6-2. The B Flight singles final consisted of Arizona teammates freshmen Susan McRann and Kim Stubbe. They will play the championship match in Tucson.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Erica Cano, who won a match in the A Flight doubles tournament with senior Michelle Murphy, was also a standout performer in the B Flight single series.</p>\n<p>“She played awesome,” Kirkwood said. “Erica played aggressive and she was attacking. She has shown a lot of progress.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Kiersten Meehen was another highlight for the Gauchos, winning two of her four matches.</p>\n<p>“She had a great tournament debut,” Coach Kirkwood said. “Kiersten beat a girl from BYU and another from Denver. She played well throughout the tournament mentally and physically. She was solid all weekend. That was impressive to see with this level of competition.”</p>\n<p>Coach Kirkwood also saw promise from junior Alexandra McIntosh.</p>\n<p>“She came back and played hard,” Kirkwood said. “After struggling early on, she won her last two matches. It was fitting for how our team finished the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB failed to place in their first tournament of the year, the Gauchos ended the weekend on a high note with a win from junior Jordan Dockendorf and positive feedback from the coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“For our inaugural Classic, it was a huge success,” Kirkwood said. “Coaches got what they came for. In the fall, our goal is to play a lot of matches and play to win. It’s a chance for girls to work on their game and fight for a starting spot. We start playing the dual match schedule in January. That’s our championship season. Teams will be different in January.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team is currently without their number one player Sofia Novak, who is studying abroad in Spain. Novak returns in January.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue their season on Oct. 21-24 at the ITA West Regional, held in San Diego.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-10/ucsb-kicks-season-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-10/ucsb-kicks-season-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-10/ucsb-kicks-season-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-10/ucsb-kicks-season-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-10/ucsb-kicks-season-tourney/","id":284,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[283,282,281],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
