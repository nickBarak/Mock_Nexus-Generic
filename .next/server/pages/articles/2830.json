According to her close friends, Stone was interested in becoming a novelist after college and was passionate about music.</p>\n<p>During her time at the <i>Daily Nexus</i>, Stone showed a penchant for covering concerts and wrote notably about events such as the September 2013’s Welcome Back concert featuring Borgore and last March’s Childish Gambino concert at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Stone, originally from Nepal, spent ten years in Vietnam and moved to different residences with her family several times. She spoke Japanese, French, Spanish, Nepalese and English. Her parents reside in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>\n<p>CCS Dean and paleobiology professor Bruce Tiffney announced Stone’s passing in an email to CCS students, staff and faculty early Monday.</p>\n<p>“We are all saddened by the death of a student dear to us and full of promise,” Tiffney said in the email. “Lalita brought her best to CCS and UCSB and will be sorely missed.”</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"61765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/lita-square/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=422%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"422,422\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"lita square\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?fit=422%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-61765\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=350%2C350\" alt=\"lita square\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?w=422&amp;ssl=1 422w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lita-square.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Former <i>Daily Nexus </i>Artsweek editor and CCS art alumna Demi Anter, who worked with Stone last year, said Stone’s articles were well-written and “always had a really strong voice in them.”</p>\n<p>“She was very funny and really sort of forward about things,” Anter said. “Lita was never afraid to say that she didn’t like something. She was very strong and would stand up for her opinions about things and so that was something I hugely appreciated from writers.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s friend and fourth-year economics and accounting major Vivian Hu, who met Stone as a freshman Chi Delta Theta pledge, described Stone as frequently being “very positive” and as someone who was friends with students across the entire Greek community.</p>\n<p>“She loved everyone so fiercely. She would go above and beyond for anyone. She would do you any favor, do anything to make you feel better,” Hu said. “She’s probably the only person I can say never had a bad thing to say about anyone else.”</p>\n<p>According to Hu, Stone was selfless in her friendships with others.</p>\n<p>“She would make sure everyone else is okay before she would think of herself,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Lalita’s former roommate and global studies alumna Elaine Yoo said Stone had a passion for music and had a rich, eclectic musical taste.</p>\n<p>“Every morning when we would wake up we’d listen to a lot of The Strokes,” Yoo said. “She also liked playing the accordion and listening to classical music … [junior year] she was really into Calvin Harris and that’s kind of how it started where she wanted to attend more EDM shows and write about it.”</p>\n<p>Yoo said Stone was planning out her first novel before she passed away.</p>\n<p>“She was actually in the process of trying to write a novel … she had a list that she was making like a plan for herself,” Yoo said. “That was something she was aspiring to do.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s parents will hold a memorial service for her Tuesday, March 10, beginning at 4 p.m. in Loma Pelona Center, Room 1108, near San Rafael Residence Hall and Manzanita Village. The family will be there 4–7 p.m. and refreshments will follow the ceremony.</p>\n<p>Stone’s friends from Chi Delta Theta will hold a candlelight vigil in her honor on Wednesday, March 11, beginning at 6 p.m. in Storke Plaza.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine by a tiebreaker secret ballot of 13-12-1 after a lengthy eight-hour meeting last night in the Old Little Theater and Givertz 1004.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.</p>\n<p>“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.</p>\n<p>“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.</p>\n<p>“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”</p>\n<p>According to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.</p>\n<p>“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.</p>\n<p>“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others. But this is happening because we have terrorist organizations that have left Israel with really no other way to keep its people safe. When terrorists put their weapons down and their hatred down, the wall comes down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major and engineering collegiate senator Jonathan Rothschild said he did not support the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I cannot applaud the decision for the resolution to not acknowledge a two-state solution,” Rothschild said. “What is so wrong with acknowledging Israel’s right to exist?”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Guy Singer said he was against the resolution because it did not reflect any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked for the past two years to build alternatives and to build roads of cooperation and making out investment system more socially, environmentally and governmentally more responsible, and these efforts have been met with nothing but disdain from the pro-BDS community,” Singer said. “Any divestment resolution in the future will have to incorporate the Jewish community in some way or another in order for it to work.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film and media studies and philosophy double major and Off-campus Senator Jenna Anderson said she supported the resolution, but wanted to see amendments made.</p>\n<p>“As you can see, most every senator has expressed concerns with the wording of this resolution,” Anderson said. “Maybe I’m an idealist, but I just don’t get why we can’t come together and fix certain parts of it just to make it a little bit more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said A.S. should look into changes such as including more numbers and looking into investments in other companies that might not be socially responsible.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we could include other countries as well,” Anderson said. “If we are focusing of Palestine then why can’t we add the other companies that we are invested in the other countries and not just focus on Israel?”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and history double major Proxy Senator Andrew Farkash said he supported the resolution as a way for the university to dissociate from a stance that favors one country over another.</p>\n<p>“Our investments as they are right now value Israeli lives over Palestinian lives,” Farkash said. “I think that taking our money out of this issue makes a statement that we don’t support human rights violations, but at some point it is just saying we don’t want our hands involved whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, it was hard for him to come out as a Jewish student in support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“It is difficult for me to sit here and say that I support this resolution, because I know and acknowledge and am so deeply connected to those histories,” Farkash said. “There are thousands of Jewish people like me who are coming out and saying we love our country, we love our ethnicity, we love our religion, but we don’t love the occupation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The EVPLA office negotiates with campus administration regarding parking for Halloween and Deltopia, consults with local law enforcement agencies and distributes important information regarding I.V. and its surrounding areas to the campus community. In a 50-minute debate, the candidates for EVPLA were asked questions about what issues they would address and how they would address them if elected.</p>\n<p>One of the issues brought up during the EVPLA debate was student housing, particularly the high cost of living in I.V.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit.

I believe that our community needs self-governance in Isla Vista. This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, the structural changes outlined by AB-3 are not enough to incite change in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t do nearly enough,” Morse said. “I think that it’s a way to appease the students at this particular point in time. What we really need is representation, and the way that we get representation is through cityhood, not through the current structure.”</p>\n<p>In regard to addressing rape culture on campus, Dela Cruz said there have been a lack of programs to educate students about sexual violence at the university and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I will make sure that a yearlong sexual assault campaign is launched in Isla Vista because it is extremely disappointing that our university has never launched a sexual assault campaign,” Dela Cruz said. “I will make sure as the EVPLA I address this.”</p>\n<p>Morse said he wants to bring back the activism culture of I.V. in the ’60s and channel efforts toward anti-rape culture.</p>\n<p>“This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit,” Morse said. “I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62393\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877346452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62393\" data-attachment-id=\"62393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/charles-carlos-lopez-describes-how-ucs-are-unequally-financially-represented/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428970937\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"91\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62393\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt='EVPSA Candidate Charles \"Carlos\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented.

Senate in the Old Little Theater and Girvetz 1004, making speeches to the senators concerning the Students for Justice in Palestine’s recent resolution. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the Old Little Theater and then in Girvetz 1004 to discuss a resolution by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), sponsored by senators Xin Ma and Steven Kwok, which calls for the university to divest from businesses profiting from alleged human rights violations in Palestine.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students signed up to speak during public forum, giving passionate arguments both in support and in opposition of the resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC undergraduate campuses whose student governments have not yet passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in November 2012.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.” – Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Emily Schneider said students should stand in opposition to the corporations profiting from human rights violations currently being committed via the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“The problem there is not so much about religion, or other things that we see in the media, but the fact that there’s companies over there profiting off of the cycle of violence and we have the chance here as students to play a role in ending the cycle of violence for both Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Daniel Lifton, president of Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, said that the Palestinian Civil Society’s international call for a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has unreasonable demands that target Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“The demands that BDS calls for amount to the destruction of Israel it’s as simple as that,” Lifton said. “The generally agreed upon solution to this conflict is a peaceful two-state solution. I want peace; I want an Israeli state, and I want a Palestinian state.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Marjan Abubu said he is in support of the resolution and called on Senate to stand up on behalf of people oppressed by corporations named in the resolution.</p>\n<p>“We have the power to voice our opinions therefore we must speak out for those who cannot,” Abubu said. “Our unified voices cry out to denounce corporations that profit from cruelty and brutality.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati said the resolution is an attack on Israel and may have unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>“Israeli existence is questioned daily. No other nation has to deal with the constant threat of annihilation from multiple fronts. It may not seem like it, but we are standing at one of these fronts right now,” Torbati said. “This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change. You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today. – Second-year math major Alonso Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year biology major Michelle May said if the resolution were passed, it would alienate the campus’s large Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has the largest Jewish population of any UC, therefore clearly the Jewish community feels comfortable being here and discussing that they are Jewish,” May said.</p>\n<p>“This resolution alienates the Jewish community. There is no reason to pass a resolution that diminishes the happiness of such a large student population.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Alonso Martinez encouraged the Senate to pass the divestment resolution near the end of public forum by putting the BDS movement into the historical context of past social justice struggles.</p>\n<p>“As George William, a German philosopher once said, ‘The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.’ Will you be the Senators that prove him wrong?” Martinez asked.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the opportunity to pass the divestment resolution was in the tradition of past student-initiated changes such as Black Student Union’s call for changes to the ethnic studies program to accurately reflect the UC demographic and protests against UC complicity with the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>“I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change,” Martinez said. “You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, no vote had been made on the resolution.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 6 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/","id":2829,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2828,2827,2826],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
