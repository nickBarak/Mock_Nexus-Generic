After quickly going down 5-0, Mitchell yanked all five starters.</p>\n<p>“Starting is a responsibility,” Mitchell said. “It’s their responsibility to set the tone and I didn’t feel like they did that. Everything we did was a second delayed.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit provided the needed spark off the bench to score the Gauchos’ first four points of the game. Nesbit, who may have provided the only positive on the evening, totaled 11 points.</p>\n<p>“Nicole has been pretty consistent the entire year,” Mitchell said. “If there was one shining point tonight, it was that Nicole gave us some consistency.”</p>\n<p>Lucky for UCSB, the 49ers also had a slow start, keeping the Gauchos in the game.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos closed the gap to 13-12, senior forward Tipesa Moorer hit a jumper to start a 11-2 Long Beach run to end the first half.</p>\n<p>In fact, Moorer seemed to find an answer every time UCSB even thought about finding some offensive momentum. She finished with 14 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“Moorer had a great first half,” Nesbit said. “She seemed to be in the zone. She was hitting her shots and getting everything she wanted.”</p>\n<p>After halftime, everything continued to go wrong for the Gauchos. At the 14 minute mark, the 49ers doubled up on UCSB 32-16 and about a minute later, LBSU saw their biggest lead of the game at 19 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s like it’s contagious,” Mitchell said, who compared her team’s offensive cold streak to a disease. “That basket gets really small, but it’s inexcusable. It’s unfortunate tonight that that disease hit, like, five players.”</p>\n<p>UCSB narrowly avoided going into the record books as one of the program’s lowest scoring games. Back in the 1970’s, UC Santa Barbara twice scored 32 points.</p>\n<p>“The open shots were there,” Mitchell said. The right people were taking the shots. Unfortunately they just didn’t fall.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, while the Gauchos only tallied five assists and shot 27.8 percent from the field (compared to Long Beach’s 36.7 percent), UCSB was getting good shots, which eventually will land.</p>\n<p>“We have to put this game behind us,” Nesbit said. “Two-game road trips are always hard, but we just have to move on because we can’t let this loss affect our next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound this Saturday at Cal State Northridge. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/gauchos-fall-long-beach-host-northridge-saturday/","id":795,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[794,793,792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hosts Long Beach on National Stage","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This is what it’s all about.

The 49ers are coming off a 78-69 win on the road at Cal Poly on Thursday night. A team that thrives on a fast-paced dynamic offense, Long Beach State leads the Big West in scoring offense (74.4 points per game), scoring margin of victory (14 per game), and field goal percentage (47.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“You have to slow them down, they are by far the best transition offensive team,” Williams said of the 49ers. “They get out and fly offensively. We will have to contain [Casper] Ware — he is a one man wrecking crew — and keep them off the boards.”</p>\n<p>Ware, the senior Long Beach point guard who joined the Gauchos’ Johnson on the Wooden Award Preseason Top-50 list, ranks third in the Big West with 16.4 points per game. Long Beach senior forward T.J. Robinson and senior guard Larry Anderson rank 10th and 8th in the conference in scoring, with 14.7 and 12.6 points per game, respectively. Robinson leads the conference in rebounds with 10.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a really good team, there is no doubt about it,” Williams said. “They get pretty fired up to play us. The taste of what happened in the Big West championships against us is something that they carry in their mouth. … We are going to have to fight that fire and beat their intensity.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers gained national notoriety for its amazingly tough nonconference schedule. At one time, Long Beach’s RPI (Rating Percentage Index, a measure of strength of schedule) was No. 1 in the country, after the veteran squad beat then No. 9 Pittsburgh and No. 14 Xavier, and played other nationally ranked squads to close decisions.</p>\n<p>“They play the toughest schedule they can get,” Williams said. “[Long Beach Head Coach Dan Monson] feels it makes his team battle tested, and is a great way to prepare them for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>The matchup at Long Beach may be even more important, given the Gauchos upcoming schedule. After facing the 49ers tomorrow night, UCSB plays seven of its next eight games on the road, including four straight away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“Those seven of eight games on the road is a daunting task,” Williams said. “We just have to focus and take care of business at home first.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to capitalize on its home court advantage against Long Beach. The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, having only narrowly lost to No. 16 San Diego State in overtime and No. 14 UNLV in double overtime. With national television cameras in the Thunderdome, a crowded and rowdy student section is expected.</p>\n<p>“Some of the best crowds we have ever had have been at home this year,” Williams said. “It really pushes us on.”</p>\n<p>In the win over Northridge, both teams played zone defense the entire game, with the Matadors applying full-court pressure. Although CSUN leads the conference in steals per game, UCSB came out on top in all of the “hustle” categories, recording more rebounds, blocks and steals.</p>\n<p>Despite taking seven fewer shots than CSUN in the first half, UCSB entered the locker room with a 31-22 advantage. The Gauchos came out slow at the onset of the second half, and turnovers allowed the Matadors to run off an 11-0 run to take a 33-31 lead with 17 minutes remaining, Northridge’s first lead of the game. At that point, coach Williams had seen enough, and decided to sub in a fresh five off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I think that was the first time this year that I have [subbed in] five new,” Williams said. “There was just an energy on the floor that had to change.

The Matadors, who currently lead the Big West in steals per game, beat UC Davis (1-16, 0-5) on Saturday after losing to Pacific (5-12, 1-4) and Long Beach State (12-6, 5-0).</p>\n<p>Freshman center Alan “Big Al” Williams has started the last three games for the Gauchos, contributing in a big way as a force inside. Williams has averaged 8.8 points per game and a team-leading 10.5 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game, which both rank him second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Al is just a beast,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said of the freshman big man. “You can’t really keep him off the glass … He is so big and strong, but also very athletic.”</p>\n<p>Using Williams has allowed Coach Williams to play a bigger lineup, sliding senior forward Jaime Serna — who often starts at the center position — to power forward. Serna, who was hurt on Jan. 5 against Cal State Fullerton, missed the game at UC Riverside and played minimally against UC Irvine, but is expected to start tonight against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“Our big lineup has been very productive for us,” Coach Williams said. “It allows us to be versatile off the bench and create some nice mismatches.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, with their only losses coming in overtime against San Diego State, and double overtime against UNLV in November. After two consecutive home games this weekend, Santa Barbara will hit the road, where it plays four straight — and seven of the next eight contests — away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“All home games are really important,” Coach Williams said. “You want to win games at home and take care of business as much as possible.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/","id":793,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[792,791,790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Take on CSULB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After an easy victory against UC Riverside last weekend, the UCSB women’s basketball team will see tougher competition when it hits the road to face Long Beach State tonight.

We’re going to see some zones, so we’re going to have to execute a little quicker.”</p>\n<p>Like UCSB, the 49ers feature a balanced attack on offense. Three players average 9.3 points or higher. Senior forward Tipesa Moorer leads the attack with 12.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[Moorer’s] a little undersized but she’s been putting up big numbers,” Mitchell said. “She’s a mismatch problem because they’re basically playing four guards and that can sometimes get us in trouble because Tilleman’s more comfortable playing post defense.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also have to keep an eye on freshman guard Alex Sanchez. Averaging 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds, Sanchez is a very versatile player who can play many positions.</p>\n<p>“They’re all very athletic and quick,” sophomore guard Melissa Zornig said. “I think as long as we play our defense and execute on the offensive end we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday against UCR, UC Santa Barbara found their offensive stride. Offensive execution has been a weakness for the Gauchos, so the team hopes the offensive fluidity will carry with them on the road.</p>\n<p>“I think we were finally hitting some shots,” Zornig said. “In games like that, when we come fired up, the flow of the game is a lot better and then that’s when we start hitting shots.”</p>\n<p>Underwood especially was on fire in their last game, scoring a team-high 16 points after recently returning to the starting line-up.</p>\n<p>“[I’m] just going in and doing all that I can to contribute to the team to get a ‘W,’” Underwood said. “[For Long Beach], I’m focusing on rebounding and the things I can control.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road is never easy, but Long Beach is especially great at home at 6-2.</p>\n<p>“I know they just had a tough stretch on the road, but Long Beach is a lot better team at home,” Mitchell said. At the end of the day, if you want to win conference, you have to win road games.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Thursday is set for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43670\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43670\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/gauchos-travel-csulb/","id":794,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[793,792,791],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
