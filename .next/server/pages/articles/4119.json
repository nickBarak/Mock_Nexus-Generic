At this time, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is referring to the dropped fraternity member as John Smith, as currently there is no official or criminal report naming him as the alleged perpetrator. </span></p>\n<p><b>A Sigma Pi Member’s Expulsion From the Fraternity: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the night of Oct. 3, a screenshot of a Sigma Pi member’s Facebook profile was circulated in several different sorority group chats, with members stating to others that he had “raped two different girls last night,” as described in a screenshot of one chat obtained by the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sigma Pi member whose Facebook profile was circulated confirmed in a phone call with the Nexus that he had been dropped from Sigma Pi and said that he felt no one was listening to his side of the story. He had arranged to meet with the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but canceled the meeting less than 40 minutes before it was scheduled to occur; he did not respond to follow-up requests to reschedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe confirmed that the name of the Sigma Pi member being circulated was the same member she had reported to Ryan Macke, president of Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macke did not respond to multiple requests for comment and would not verify the name of the member that was expelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In text messages between Doe and Macke, which were shared with the Nexus, Macke confirmed to Doe on Oct. 5 that a member had been removed from the fraternity, and that Sigma Pi’s “Nationals acknowledged his dismemberment last night.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90630\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/screenshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-90630\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90630\" data-attachment-id=\"90630\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/screenshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?fit=2048%2C1418&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1418\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screenshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?fit=888%2C615&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?resize=888%2C615\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?resize=768%2C532&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshots.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy Of Doe </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macke went on to say in the text messages that he was sending a message to other Greek life presidents regarding the matter, “letting them know the member has been expelled and this is absolutely not a representation of our house nor do we condone this type of behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his message to the other Greek life presidents, Macke referenced the screenshot of the Sigma Pi member’s Facebook profile that had been circulating and said Sigma Pi leadership had spent the previous day “trying to find out the details to take the correct course of action.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Doe’s Story: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The night of Oct. 3, Doe said she was “pretty sober” when she ran into Smith, the alleged perpetrator, who she had met previously sometime during the last academic year and hung out with platonically throughout the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Doe, the two of them went into an empty room “that no one was living in” in the Sigma Pi house and began to “hook up.” But then “[he] got so crazy aggressive so fast,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was doing things and I kept telling him to stop, and he was saying, ‘I don’t care,’” Doe said. “There was a lot of me pressed down on the ground, and I didn’t know how I was going to leave …  he just kept saying,‘You’re not leaving tonight, you’re gonna stay.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt so uncomfortable, so out of control. I could have punched him in the nose … or I could have started screaming, or at least yelled ‘get the fuck off of me.’ But I don’t know what it is … there’s this shame of, ‘I should’ve stood up for myself because I respected myself.’ And the moment I didn’t, so what does that say about what happened, you know what I mean?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get him to let her go, Doe said she told Smith that she needed to say goodbye to her friends “because they’re waiting for me” and told him she would “come right back.” She left and texted a group chat at 11:42 p.m. that night “CODE RED” and “where are you guys” in messages she showed the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She returned to her house with a group of friends, “and we were in my room, you know, crying, and I was a little in shock, like I had no idea what was going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another friend who discovered Doe in her room during this time spoke to the Nexus and independently verified Doe’s recounting of the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Doe’s friend went to get her water, she learned of a second woman returning to their house who had allegedly also been sexually assaulted by Smith after Doe left the Sigma Pi fraternity house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said it was this instance that pushed her to report the incident to Macke the next morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t gonna say anything, which looking back is crazy, you know what I mean? Because you should always say something,” Doe said. “Right when I found out it was beyond me, I was like, ‘I need to report this.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning, she called a close friend in Sigma Pi, who arranged a meeting between her and Macke. She said she met with Macke at noon, and at 3:41 p.m. that day, she received a text from her friend in Sigma Pi saying “he’s dropped,” referring to Smith.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Greek Life Responded: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the events of Oct. 3, Sigma Pi canceled its Midnight Madness party — one of the parties typically held every year by nearly all UCSB fraternities following the completion of rush week – Macke said in a message to the other Greek life presidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks later, on Oct. 17, the university sent out an alert about </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/two-incidents-involving-date-rape-drugs-reported-at-fraternity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two reported incidents involving date-rape drugs on Oct. 5 at an unnamed fraternity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The university’s alert sparked heavy backlash on social media both from students and local community members, with many taking issue with the fact that the university had not included the name of the fraternity involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe told the Nexus that the incidents of sexual assault that she reported to Macke were unrelated to the reported use of date-rape drugs mentioned in the alert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the university alert, the UCSB Interfraternity Council (IFC) announced in an email on Oct. 18 to all IFC members that they had decided to place a five-day suspension on “all fraternity social activities” between Oct. 18 and the morning of Oct. 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend all social activities was made “in light of an unprecedented level of misconduct from fraternity members and concerns from local law enforcement and University administration about systemic issues within the fraternity system,” according to the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the circulation of the fraternity member’s Facebook profile, rumors have spread around campus and Isla Vista regarding the location and alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. Sigma Pi’s name was mentioned by several social media accounts; one social justice-oriented Instagram account scheduled a protest walk against Sigma Pi before canceling it later that day to “give time for the victims to heal,” they wrote in a </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hT8YH80r/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said she agreed to speak with the Nexus because she needed to set the record straight. She emphasized that what happened to her “isn’t a Sigma Pi problem, and it’s not a Greek life problem. It’s a hookup culture problem.” She added that Macke and other Sigma Pi members have “been there every second of the way.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That shit probably happens all the time — at parties that aren’t even Greek-affiliated, you know?” she said. “What’s crazy about this is I’m grateful in a weird way that he was in a frat, because it was taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though nobody knows it’s us, we’ve gone out with friends and they’ve been like, ‘Did you hear about those girls who got raped?’ That sucks […] I don’t want it to be like that — I want it to be like, ‘Did you hear about that guy that did that horrible thing?

Smith then advanced to second on a wild pitch, Hornung’s second wild pitch of the inning, giving the Gauchos an extra base. With Smith on second and Burns on third, the all-mighty and powerful Austin Bush, who struck out swinging in his first at-bat, crushed a three-run jack for No. 19 of the year to surpass Tyler Von Schell (18 HRs, 2001).</p>\n<p>After Bush cleared them, senior outfielder Billy Fredrick got on with a walk, and junior utility Kenny Corey drilled an RBI triple to left field to add one more run before the end of the first half of the third and make it 5-0.</p>\n<p>Hawaii had an opportunity to retaliate and score in the bottom of the third with two outs when junior second baseman Johnny Weeks singled to right and Davis loaded the bases after handing over two consecutive walks, but Davis then got himself out of the inning by striking out final batter sophomore Kekai Rios to leave all three Rainbow Warriors stranded.</p>\n<p>Both sides left one guy on base through a scoreless fourth, and if Hornung thought Bush might have had enough for the day after achieving his record, he was sorely mistaken. One homer was certainly not enough for Bush, as he opened the top of the fifth with a solo shot to right center for home run No. 20 of the season before Hornung sent the following three Gauchos back to the dugout.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the fifth started with Rainbow Warriors redshirt junior Chayce Kaaua both reaching first and advancing to second on back-to-back throwing errors from UCSB junior shortstop JJ Muno. Kaaua then went to third on a single to right center from junior center fielder Dylan Vchulek, who rounded and made it to second on the throw, and RBI team leader freshman Dustin Demeter finally drove in some runs for Hawaii with a single to left, increasing his running RBI count from 27 to 29 and changing the score board from a 6-0 shutout to a 6-2 four-run deficit.</p>\n<p>However, this four-run deficit would increase to a five-run deficit with a score of 7-2 by the top of the eighth when the Gauchos added one final run on an RBI sac-bunt from Grover, while Hawaii’s bats were only able to produce those two runs for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>Games two and three of this weekend’s series at Les Murakami Stadium will prove to be just as important as this one, with the 2017 season coming to a close and Santa Barbara and Hawaii now tied in BWC standings. Both squads will be looking to knock each other down while chasing UC Davis (9-13 BWC), who is just one game ahead in conference.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/ucsb-secures-victory-in-opening-game-of-hawaii-series/","id":4116,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4115,4114,4113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Can UCSB Baseball Return to CWS Form in 2017-18?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Baseball-170226-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Baseball-170226-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was another successful offseason for the UCSB baseball team, who is looking to return in 2018 with a vengeance.

Arellano, the fifth-rated LHP in California, recorded 51 strikeouts in 38 innings last season for Downey High School and was drafted in the 36th round by the Indians.</p>\n<p>Fariss featured as a two-way star at Valencia High School in California, hitting .368 as a senior outfielder while also pitching his way to a 3.43 ERA.</p>\n<p>In addition to these recruits, UCSB will return star shortstop Clay Fisher, who opted to return for his senior year rather than go pro due to circumstances outside his control.</p>\n<p>Fisher’s season was cut short by Tommy John surgery last year, and he will be welcomed back with open arms after hitting .353 his sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t have much time to adjust, as they take on San Diego State to open the season Feb.16.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs, who finished last season 41-19 and advanced to the regional semifinals, will present a stark challenge for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After coming home for their opener against Fresno State, UCSB must take on a formidable Mississippi State team that reached the Super Regionals last year as part of the Kleberg Bank Classic Tournament in Texas.</p>\n<p>Other notable non-conference games include a home series against Penn State March 3, as well as a three-game homestand against reigning WAC conference champion Sacramento State beginning March 16.</p>\n<p>After its final nonconference game March 27 at Pepperdine, UCSB will return home to begin conference play against Cal State Fullerton, a perennial contender in the Big West who reached the College World Series last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara lost two of its three games against Fullerton, and the game will allow the Gauchos to gauge whether they will be contenders or pretenders in the conference this season.</p>\n<p>April features primarily conference games for the Gauchos, with a home and away game interspersed against USC.</p>\n<p>UCSB swept the Pac-12 school last year in their two games, and will look to do more of the same this season during the midweek matchups.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the season, Santa Barbara will get its hand at Long Beach State, the 2017 Big West champion who beat Santa Barbara in two of its three matchups last year.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos hope to contend in the Big West this season, they will likely need to win the series against the 49ers, which begins May 11.</p>\n<p>With a much healthier, more experienced team and an abundance of talented recruits, UCSB will look to prove that last season was merely a fluke and that this year’s team can replicate the Cinderella success that this team was able to find in 2016.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
