Safe Committee, aiming to both recognize April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month and set a new tone for survivorship in I.V., according to Spencer Brandt, president of the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</p>\n<p>“[Sexual violence] is something that our community knows and takes very seriously already, but it was also important to try to debunk some of the myths that are around sexual violence both when it comes to law enforcement, when it comes to who can be made into a victim or survivor of sexual violence,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The video series tackles attitudes toward sexual assault with a three-pronged approach, focusing on the role and support of law enforcement, prosecutors, friends and family during survivors’ times of turmoil. Each video includes members from the aforementioned communities discussing support for survivors in the legal and healing processes.</p>\n<p>I.V. Safe Committee is a collaborative group composed of legal and government offices in I.V. and Santa Barbara. The committee is made up of the I.V. CSD, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, UCPD, SBSO, Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) and more.</p>\n<p>The committee and Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), a UCSB student group advocating for survivor resources and ending sexual violence, worked on the videos together over the last months.</p>\n<p>The videos were released just in time for April, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>One of Brandt’s hopes was that the videos would do more to encourage survivors to come forward with their experiences. He said this is an important goal in addressing and solving sexual violence in the community.</p>\n<p>“If we do not have more people feel comfortable going through and doing that, then it’s going to continue to be very difficult to solve a lot of these cases, and that really is the bottom line,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Numbers from UCSB’s Title IX Office showed that there had been 320 individual reports of sexual violence in 2018, 140 instances of sexual harassment, 18 instances of sexual discrimination and 133 instances labeled “other.”</p>\n<p>But Brandt noted the numbers of survivors who report incidents of sexual violence is far less than the number of people who actually experience it.</p>\n<p>“The harsh reality is that sexual violence is both incredibly prevalent in the community and peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that the likelihood of survivors coming forward and reporting their assault to either a law enforcement agency or through other avenues is incredibly low,” Brandt said. “We’re looking at a number of about 10 or 20%.”</p>\n<p>For Emily Montalvo-Telford, director of SASA, it was important that the working process of the videos included input from student voices, especially considering the intended audience of the videos.</p>\n<p>“It’s always best to work with the community that you’re trying to send a message to and hearing [student] voices as a part of the conversation,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The conversation around sexual violence necessitated change, and the video series is a step in a better direction toward helping survivors by leaving behind the phrase “we believe survivors” for something more encompassing, Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“For me personally, believing survivors is a necessary step, but it’s not enough. It’s not sufficient. So the concept of ‘we stand with survivors’ is a commitment to support and a commitment to consistent allyship,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The videos is just one of many actions taken by I.V. community to create a safe environment for survivors and residents in general, Brandt said. This includes the hiring of an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">interpersonal violence investigator</a> in November 2018 and the signing of agreement between I.V. CSD and STESA to create a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\">survivor resource center</a> in I.V. in January.</p>\n<p>“Our community is, I think, really at the forefront of being able to create a culture where it’s both acceptable to talk frankly about these issues and also where we stand with survivors when they come forward and that we will believe them without any reservations whatsoever,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11th print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/discovery-requests-push-iv-menus-owners-rape-hearing-to-june/\">postponed</a> three times before it was held on June 6. On Wednesday, Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge James Herman set his trial date for Jan. 16, 2019.</p>\n<p>Galoustian’s two criminal cases were consolidated on July 11, and he currently faces 33 felony charges overall.</p>\n<p>He pled not guilty to all charges. His bail is set at $1 million.</p>\n<p>In Doe 1’s case, Galoustian allegedly found the victim intoxicated in a parking lot and “helped her up to his apartment,” Herman said.</p>\n<p>Galoustian was arrested on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/owner-of-iv-menus-arrested-on-3-felony-charges-of-rape-pleads-not-guilty/\">four felony charges</a> on Dec. 18 by the UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD).</p>\n<p>UCSB sent out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/suspect-arrested-for-reported-rape-in-isla-vista/\">timely warning</a> on Dec. 19, 2017 regarding the incident but did not name the suspect at that time.</p>\n<p>Those charges include kidnap to commit robbery or rape, rape of a drugged and intoxicated victim, penetration with foreign object and two counts of oral copulation by use of force or injury.</p>\n<p>In Doe 2’s case, Galoustian and Doe 2 allegedly began text correspondence in November 2017, when Galoustian was in Isla Vista and Doe 2 was in Los Angeles, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The two then arranged for Galoustian to have sex with Doe 2 in exchange for money, a price they haggled over before settling on $1,200, according to text messages presented in court.</p>\n<p>“So $1.2k for entire day of sleepover,” read the message from Doe 2 to Galoustian.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 22, 2017, Galoustian indicated that he was going to travel to Los Angeles to meet Doe 2, according to the text messages.</p>\n<p>Galoustian then traveled to Los Angeles to have sex with Doe 2, according to Robert Sanger, Galoustian’s lawyer. Doe 2 then returned with Galoustian to Santa Barbara for a photoshoot.</p>\n<p>UCPD Detective Alexis Dougherty also confirmed this during her testimony on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The UCPD, through its own investigation, found videos on Galoustian’s phone, according to Dougherty. In some of the videos Doe 2 is seen participating in sexual activity, while in others she appears to be asleep or unconscious.</p>\n<p>Sanger questioned whether the evidence could be proved criminal in nature, referring to the “arrangement where payment for sex” was made, footage where the victim “appeared to have her eyes open sometimes, aware sometimes, participating sometimes,” and the photoshoot the two participated in the next day.</p>\n<p>Sanger further alleged that all sexual activity with Doe 2 occurred in Los Angeles. He argued Galoustian’s case should be tried under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County Court as opposed to Santa Barbara County, with a motion to set aside the indictment.</p>\n<p>However, Herman said because Galoustian brought Doe 2 back to Santa Barbara County, it is rightfully Santa Barbara County’s case to try.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Herman denied the motion to set aside the indictment or information.</p>\n<p>Herman also said Galoustian presents a history of taking advantage of women in “improper mental conditions,” citing Doe 1’s intoxication and Doe 2’s alleged drugging by Galoustian.</p>\n<p>Herman set Galoustian’s readiness and settlement conference for Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>The prosecution expects the trial in January to take six weeks, or approximately 18 court days.</p>\n<p>Court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Galoustian-Court-Cases.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Lan Nguyen contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>Correction [Jun. 26, 2019]: Judge James Herman’s name was previously incorrectly spelled as Hernan.</p>\n<p>Updated [Oct. 21]: This article was updated to include pdfs of the court documents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
