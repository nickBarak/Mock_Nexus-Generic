","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following Friday night’s game against the San Diego State Aztecs, the UCSB women’s basketball team is no longer in the midst of a losing streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos beat the Aztecs by a final score of 77-64 despite a slow start and gained some much-needed momentum at home. Picking up only their second win of the regular season, the Gauchos now stand at 2-9 overall. But, more importantly, UCSB’s nine-game losing streak is over.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, SDSU has now fallen in its last two games and holds a record of 6-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Following the win, redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman understood the significance of earning the win before the winter break.</p>\n<p>“We all wanted to end it on a good note, come back here in a more positive light,” Edelman said. “It’s been [a question of] ‘when are we going to figure it out? ‘When are we going to get a win?,’ so it was just really imperative that we figured it out tonight and we did, so we were able to get it.”</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and SDSU started the game appearing a bit rusty on both ends of the court. After winning the tip, the Aztecs got things rolling with a Khalia Lark jumper. Lark later hit a three to score five of her team-high 14 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled offensively yet again in the first period of play, managing to score only 7 points. Sarah Bates got the Gauchos on the board to tie the game at 2-2, her only points of the quarter.</p>\n<p>A layup and a pair of free throws from redshirt senior Drew Edelman plus a single free throw by Chaya Durr rounded out the Santa Barbara 7-point effort. The Gauchos gave up an 8-1 run to the Aztecs to end the quarter, finding themselves down 16-7 and the subjects of an animated speech from their head coach. In the quarter, Santa Barbara shot a dismal 15.4 field goal percentage while going 0-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke to her team’s performance after the game; “Sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win and remember how to win, it’s been a while. We’re capable of so much more, we’ve practiced well through all of this.”</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start and disappointing first quarter, the Gauchos turned things around in a major way in the second quarter. Shooting a much-improved 64.3 percent and going 5-of-8 from three-point land helped Santa Barbara put the Aztecs on their heels and take the lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed energy on the defensive end, getting stops to build momentum as more of their shots fell on the other end. Locking down defensively, UCSB held SDSU to only 10 points in the quarter and forced the Aztecs to shoot 35.7 percent from the field. With 6:45 remaining in the half, Edelman got a layup to go off a nice feed from Sarah Bates to put the Gauchos within a point, 18-17.</p>\n<p>The teams traded buckets until close to the end of the quarter, when Henrickson subbed Tal Sahar into the game. Sahar entered the game with her team down 26-23 at the 2:13 mark. In the final minutes of the half, Sahar gave the Gauchos a 7-0 run to take their first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore leaked out twice for fast break layups and hit a corner three; however, Sahar would not return until the end of the game. UCSB went into halftime with plenty of momentum from their 23-point quarter, up on the Aztecs 30-26.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Edelman spoke to her team’s defensive intensity following the game.</p>\n<p>“Usually the ability to take shots isn’t our problem, it’s definitely on the defensive end,” she said. “We were able to get a lot more stops tonight than we have been able to in the previous nights and also our communication has gotten a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Only up by four at the start of the second half, Santa Barbara found a way to keep its foot on the gas, scoring 27 points in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>With starting freshman point guard Danae Miller getting in foul trouble early, senior guard Makala Roper was tasked with more minutes. Roper controlled the ball and was instrumental in working the ball into Edelman. Henrickson had high praise for her senior guard at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>“[Roper] was really good for really long stretches, I mean really good,” Henrickson said. “She made good decisions with the ball, let go of it, keep it, drive it at the rim, she was good.”</p>\n<p>Edelman herself had a dominant quarter, scoring 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the game with 11 points and a game-high 8 assists. With just over three minutes to go in the quarter, the game was close with the Gauchos up 45-40. Sarah Bates hit a three ball to extend the Santa Barbara lead to 8, then the Gauchos started pouring it on, going on a 12-0 run.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara rolling, SDSU was simply outmatched and looked dismantled. Edelman’s 15-point quarter was part of her season-high 25 points, and the talented forward pulled down 10 boards to record a double-double. Shooting 71.4 percent in the quarter, UCSB found itself up on the Aztecs 57-40 heading into the final ten minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter was SDSU’s best, as they score 24 points; however, it wasn’t enough to make the game interesting. Santa Barbara was outscored by four in the quarter, but the Gauchos converted 11 of 12 free throws to finish out the game and secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates played the whole game for Santa Barbara, aside from going to the bench a few seconds before being summoned back due to foul trouble of her teammates. Bates was huge for her team in getting the win. The freshman had 15 points to go along with 7 boards and was a vocal leader on defense.</p>\n<p>In the first time since 1999, Santa Barbara defeated the Aztecs. SDSU struggled carrying out their game plan against the Gauchos, losing the battle in the paint by a ten-point deficit and being outrebounded 35-23.</p>\n<p>McKynzie Fort, the Aztecs’ leading scorer on the season, was handled well by the Santa Barbara defense, as she was held to just 10 points and a single rebound in 38 minutes.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now have a short break for the holidays before returning to action for its last non-conference game against New Mexico State next Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/","id":747,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[746,745,744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift","biography":"Not available","articles":[32,33,42,202,203,206,218,221,598,603,655,675,681,691,696,747,770,781,819,837,838,846,865,898,938,944,945,946,950,969,997,1209,1212,1213,1214,1330,1836,1849,1871,4876,4887,4890,4908,4909,4910,4911,4912,4913,4914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Women Complete Storybook Ending With Win Over Long Beach State in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince — a Big West Championship and an automatic berth into the Big Dance.

At the end of the day, this is why you play the game–for March Madness and a chance to cut down nets.”</p>\n<p>It was a tough regular season for the Gauchos indeed. After winning the Big West a season ago, UC Santa Barbara experienced a lot of change, beginning with a new Head Coach. For a while, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>The team was not going to give up though and all season long, Mitchell reiterated that her team would peak when it mattered most in March and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors could leave. The Gauchos won nine of their last 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special. All the hard times that we went through this year…I wouldn’t trade it for this moment right now.”</p>\n<p>And as the title game came to a close, it was evident in the team the obstacles they had faced and overcame. With under a minute left, Johnson exited from her final Big West game with tears of joy and as that final buzzer sounded, the team flooded the court. Johnson, along with senior forward Kelsey Adrian, was embraced in celebration. The team couldn’t get those championship t-shirt on quicker.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way. They wanted to leave their legacy, which was a Big West Championship, so I only have to thank them for believing in me.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After taking a nine point lead to begin the second half, Long Beach took a timeout and the 49’ers responded. Freshman guard Alex Sanchez sparked a 13-3 run and the Beach took its first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading three point shooter, Adrian, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead, a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period. That would be enough to give UCSB its 14th title, the most in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“I have to thank Coach Stringer for preparing me for this opportunity, but I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship game, the Gauchos put a complete game together. They defeated Pacific 84-66 and got revenge on the team that knocked them out in the first round the year before.</p>\n<p>“We came in with a chip on our shoulder, knowing how horrible it felt last year to top the conference and lose to one of the last seeds on your home floor,” Nesbit said. “So when we came out here, we knew we had to play a solid forty minutes to get the win.”</p>\n<p>While known for playing in low scoring games, it was impossible to guess that the Gauchos were dead last in scoring. The 84 points is a season high for UCSB and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit, finished with 23 and 20 points, respectively. Both are career highs for the sophomore guards. Johnson also finished with 20 points, hitting 10-12 at the free throw line to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling a bit during season and this is the time to turn it on,” Zornig said. “I wanted to come in, step up, and do whatever I can to help this team win.”</p>\n<p>After taking a 37-28 lead into halftime, UOP immediately closed the gap to four to begin the second half. However, UCSB pulled away, tallying 47 second half points.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>With a Big West Championship and a potential run in the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos have certainly left their legacy.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45606\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45606\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/","id":744,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[743,742,741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Bring Home the Hardware","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time a No. 6 seed has ever won the Big West Tournament, as the Gauchos overcame Long Beach State 63-54, beating three teams in their journey to the title.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way.

For much of this season, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>Mitchell reiterated all season long that her team would peak when it mattered most in March, and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors, could leave.</p>\n<p>The squad responded over the past few weeks, winning nine of its final 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards, eight on the offensive end. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field through the opening 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After taking a quick nine-point lead in the second half, Long Beach responded with a 13-3 run and the 49’ers took their first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>Adrian, UCSB’s leading three-point shooter, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead that they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period.</p>\n<p>“I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship, the Gauchos had to first overcome a University of Pacific squad that had beaten them during both of the teams’ regular season meetings. UCSB’s 84 points against UOP was a season high, and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit finished with career highs of 23 and 20 points apiece, while Johnson tallied 20 of her own on 10-12 shooting from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now faces Baylor in first round action of the NCAA women’s basketball tournament next Sunday, March 18.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/","id":745,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[744,743,742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Face San Jose State on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels north to face San Jose State after notching its first conference victory last week against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a strong conference win recorded last Saturday against Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB women’s tennis team looks to carry the momentum to the Bay Area, where it will face San Jose State this Saturday.</p>\n<p>After defeating Fullerton last weekend, the Gauchos improved to 2-7 overall with a conference record of 1-1, while San Jose St. currently sits with a 4-8 record.</p>\n<p>UCSB, which received its first win after a five-match losing skid, has been focusing heavily on making its team stronger and healthier.

A very impressive stat comes from Spartan senior Sabastian Leon Chao who won her 119th match against Cal Poly; with that victory Chao boosted herself to second place all-time on the Spartan’s career win list.</p>\n<p>This is without a doubt a strong and imposing Spartan team; UCSB will have to arrive riding the taste of victory it received from its impressive win at Fullerton. The Gauchos have been in a season-long pursuit for improved mental strength and physical stamina. If Santa Barbara can harvest these two components, then it has a good chance of gaining the advantage over San Jose St. this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge will be dealing with various injuries, which can lead to some confidence issues,” Scatliffe said. “Everyone is doing their best to stay or get healthy and compete as hard as possible no matter what obstacles we face.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to take the courts this Saturday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54230\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54230\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-travel-to-face-san-jose-state-on-saturday/","id":746,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[745,744,743],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
