Now, Title IX will only apply to sexual violence that occurs in university-owned off-campus buildings or “any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution,” such as a fraternity or sorority house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university owns and leases a handful of apartment buildings in Isla Vista, as well as 910 Embarcadero Del Mar, the site of Dublin’s Sports Grill and Precious Slut Tattoo Parlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that the “vast majority” of gender-based violence cases that C.A.R.E. sees occur in off-campus housing in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really concerned that there’s going to be cases that would have been eligible for Title IX [that] will no longer be eligible for those investigations,” Conway said in a phone interview. “But [I.V. is] just one less area that offenders can be accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, survivors of sexual assault can still report to local law enforcement such as the UC Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, or seek counseling from organizations like C.A.R.E., but will not be able to report the incident to the Title IX office if the sexual assault took place in I.V., Conway said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while university-sanctioned fraternity and sorority houses are officially recognized buildings within Title IX’s scope, the new regulations leave areas like fraternity satellite houses out of the university’s jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The new regulations] wouldn’t include those spaces … That’s really dangerous for our community, especially because we have so much off-campus housing that is not owned by the university,” said Alia Reynolds, the director of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said that the jurisdiction restrictions are a “ridiculous standard” that will impact safety in I.V.; the I.V. CSD board </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-15/i-v-csd-condemns-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protested the amendments in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> submitted to the Department of Education during the public comment period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you create a policy that requires the university to sort of draw a line around the areas where they have jurisdiction to investigate sexual violence and which areas that they do not, you are, by definition, discouraging survivors from coming forward and using the judicial tools that should be at their disposal to seek justice,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations also narrow the definition of sexual violence as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” — a definition first established by the 1999 Supreme Court case</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had not previously been used as Title IX’s definition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, under Obama-era policy, an incident had to be either severe, pervasive or objectively offensive to qualify as sexual harassment; under the new regulations, an incident must be considered all three in order to be under the umbrella of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said that the change from “or” to “and” may seem small, but the language change makes a large difference in what may be considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That would essentially mean that the instance [of sexual violence] — because it has to be severe and pervasive and objectively offensive — has to happen more than one time, which is the definition of pervasive. So it excludes a lot of instances of sexual harassment [with] this new definition,” Reynolds explained. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710641/PACAOS-Appendix-E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the UC Title IX policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, first-time occurences of dating violence, stalking and domestic violence are still included in the definition of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, universities will have to choose a universal evidentiary standard for handling sexual assault, either with the preponderance of the evidence standard or with the clear and convincing evidence standard for all cases. Previously, schools could use different standards in different cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preponderance of evidence standard requires that there is a 50.1% chance that the charges are true, while the clear and convincing evidence standard requires a higher threshold of 75.1%, according to Conway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Systemwide Title IX Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding which standard the university will use moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges and universities are also no longer required to designate most employees, such as professors or staff, as “mandatory reporters,” meaning they will no longer be required to report an incident of sexual violence to the Title IX office if they are informed of it. Instead, schools must now decide “which of their employees must, may, or must only with a student’s consent, report sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator,” according to the new regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes the change will lower the amount of cases reported but said that in her opinion, this particular addition to the Title IX policy isn’t entirely negative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some individuals disclose an instance of sexual assault to someone that they didn’t realize was a mandated reporter. And then those instances are reported and they wish they hadn’t been,” Reynolds explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mandatory reporters are essential to connecting students to the C.A.R.E. office, Conway said. She’s worried that this change will erase the work of faculty in connecting students to the services C.A.R.E. offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because you don’t have to report doesn’t mean it’s not the right thing to do to get that survivor connected with the resources and with an advocate,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, colleges can no longer use the single-investigator model — in which an investigator writes a report and concludes the case, but no hearing takes place — to investigate an incident of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under current California law, however, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-california-universities-title-ix-20190215-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities haven’t used the single-investigator model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since January 2019. Prior to January 2019, hearings of Title IX cases in California were conducted only in the appeal process, by either the complainant or the respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations permit live cross-examination of the complainant and the respondent by advisers and lawyers, but prohibits complainants and respondents from questioning each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marks a significant change from DeVos’ initial proposed policy in November 2018, which did allow for students to cross-examine each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that a downside to the hearing method, rather than the single-investigator method, is that cases will take longer to conclude, which, along with the additional trauma of a cross-examination, could further deter students from reporting. Conway said that while more students are accessing C.A.R.E. accessing than ever, she has already seen fewer C.A.R.E. clients choosing to go through the Title IX investigation process since the 2019 change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since DeVos’ announcement, several groups across the country have already pledged to fight the regulations in court, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-announces-new-rules-on-campus-sexual-assault-offering-more-rights-to-the-accused/2020/05/06/4d950c7c-8fa0-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Washington Post reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At UC Santa Barbara, student organizations have already started. Reynolds said that S.A.S.A. is working with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit organization for gender justice, and that some S.A.S.A. members are part of a newly formed national coalition against sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to work with them to try to bolster that national coalition so we can fight this on the national level as well as on the state level.” </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/12/2020, 09:21 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that a lower number of students accessing C.A.R.E. resources. This article has been corrected to state that more students are accessing C.A.R.E. resources, but fewer C.A.R.E. clients are choosing to go through Title IX investigation, according to Conway. </i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

One revision is the inclusion of “dating partners” under the definition of “intimate partners,” allowing victims to seek protection from domestic violence and stalking.</p>\n<p>The Pause for Gun Safety Act would allow friends or family members to seek a temporary “gun violence prevention order” if they fear that someone close to them is posing a threat to themselves or others. The gun violence prevention order would effectively prohibit, for a brief period, a given individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm and grant authorities permission to confiscate firearms already in possession.</p>\n<p>According to Capps, voting certain candidates into office, such as herself, will allow for changes in legislation to happen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve supported legislation ever since I got there; the relationship between gun violence and domestic violence, safety issues and now in this case, allowing a parent or someone else in a position of recognizing someone might be a danger to themselves or others, to intervene in time for the guns to be confiscated,” Capps said.</p>\n<p>Since the events of May 23, Martinez said he has toured the country, visiting 11 states as well as Washington D.C. in a campaign to change state legislation regarding gun safety.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, solving gun violence issues requires more than one answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one solution to gun violence; it’s a multifaceted problem,” Martinez said, “There isn’t one solution to this kind of thing. You make changes that incrementally solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said voting is a response that is one potential solution to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Voting matters,” Martinez said. “It’s a black-and-white choice.”</p>\n<p>According to Capps, gun control is not the only pressing issue in this “critical” election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been a champion for making college more affordable,” Capps said. “We want to make sure that we protect the environment, that we put people to work in projects that will bring our economy forward, take advantage of alternative energy other than fossil fuels. There’s protecting Medicare and social security. There’s all kinds of issues at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Capps went door-to-door in I.V. to ask community members to vote the next day. This morning, she was up at 5:00 a.m. to hang pamphlets on the doorknobs of the residences in I.V. to remind voters to turn in ballots.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of excitement in this election, so they forget about the ballot, it’s still sitting on top of the refrigerator, and then they say ‘Oh my gosh, I have this ballot here!’ Well they can take it to any polling place,” Capps said, “And there’s several of them around Isla Vista and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel, Saint Michael’s University Church, Saint Mark’s University Parish and Merton Housing Co-Op are all polling places located in I.V., while on-campus voters can go to the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, the Loma Pelona Center and the Linda Vista Room in Santa Catalina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/","id":3632,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3631,3630,3629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University of California Announces No Intention To Adjust Tuition Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tuition is set at a UC-wide level, and individual campuses do not have the authority to change it.

At UC Santa Barbara, for example, that includes an additional $103.50 RecCen2 Expansion fee, a $60.06 UCen Expansion fee and a $39.39 Transit System fee, </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among others.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was at home. I wasn’t using the library and I wasn’t using the gym and I wasn’t using the pool. But I was paying for it,” Brandmeyer, a third-year psychology major, said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she is frustrated by the UC’s dismissal of student pleas and petitions — one of which </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made rounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB in March — and for standing its ground on refusing to withhold student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most student fees are relatively small compared to the price of tuition, students who choose to foot the bill with loans will be forced to shell out “thousands and thousands of dollars” down the line as their loans compound, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very unsettled and I think it’s very hypocritical and revealing of what [the UC’s] true motive is,” she said. “At the end of the day, [they] just want to make money off us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC declined to comment on the litigation but </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/university-of-california-announces-no-intention-to-adjust-tuition-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/other-fee-information/payment-refunds.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar </span><a href=\"https://sundial.csun.edu/157547/news/csu-system-sued-for-refusing-to-refund-campus-related-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by a Sonoma State University student against the California State University system on Monday, a spokesperson for the CSU system said it will “vigorously defend against the lawsuit,” EdSource </span><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/students-sue-california-universities-over-fees-lost-amid-pandemic/630377\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said the UC’s ambivalent response in supporting students prompted her to take legal action and “to be the voice” for those who are financially impacted by having their student fees withheld. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re accepted into the University of California, they were like, ‘We’re on your side. We want you to succeed. We want you to do research. We’re here to guide you through your four years,’” Brandemeyer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But the minute you show up,” she added, “it’s kind of like, ‘Okay, well you’re on your own now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking note of the student response to the UC, Garcia said her law firm looked to </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-napolitano-refund-uc-campus-fees-for-spring-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student-generated petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fee reimbursements as a framework for what eventually developed into </span><a href=\"https://dicellolevitt.com/california-university-systems-sued-on-behalf-of-more-than-700000-students-for-refusing-to-refund-fees-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> class-action lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope to achieve the goals that the students have wanted all along,” she said. “If you’ve seen those change.org petitions that were started, there are thousands of students across the country who have signed onto those.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to ensure that the schools will stop charging fees for services that are no longer available and return the funds that they’re holding onto for services that haven’t been provided,” Garcia added. “That money belongs to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the court to make a decision, Garcia maintained that the “goal is ultimately to get the students their money back… no matter how long that takes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she has faith that she will win the lawsuit, noting the outpour of students who are working nearly full-time while balancing a packed schedule amidst the pandemic. With feelings of uncertainty, frustration and desperation in mind, “I think that a lot of people are going to be standing their ground with this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the point where a lot of people are saying enough is enough. [The UC] is saying ‘Oh, we’re saving this money for a rainy day,’” Brandmeyer said. “This is a rainy day.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
