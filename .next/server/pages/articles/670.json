Davis improves to 9-12 on the season and evens up its conference record at 5-5.</p>\n<p>“I’m actually embarrassed by how we played,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In a must-win situation for us, in a crucial game for us to come out and play like that is a disappointment.

Overall, UCSB shot 34.9 percent from the field last night.</p>\n<p>“We got good shots up there, they just weren’t falling tonight,” freshman guard Michael Bryson said. “There were times when people were right open and not able to knock it down. We’re going to have bad shooting nights, but we can’t blame the game on just the shooting. [Davis] shot lights out and we can’t let that happen.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara came out cold, Davis was on fire from the start, shooting nearly 49 percent from the field on the night. In the first half, the Aggies were shooting above 50 percent from both the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins, the Big West leading scorer, led all players with 20 points on the night while registering a team high nine rebounds. Junior guard Ryan Sypkens added 15 points while sophomore forward J.T. Adenrele scored 10 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We’re not playing together as a group, as a team right now,” sophomore center Alan Williams said. “It wasn’t close by any stretch of the imagination tonight. They completely dominated us.”</p>\n<p>Big Al, who was playing in only his second game since returning from injury, registered team highs with 15 points and 13 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored 13 points for UCSB but was 1-8 on three-point shots. He, along with freshman forward Taran Brown, pulled down eight rebounds for a Gauchos squad that fell behind 34-22 at the half.</p>\n<p>“I’m surprised we were so bad offensively that first half,” Coach Williams said. “We got frustrated, rattled by the physicalness of the game, rattled by just how they came at us. I don’t think we ever played offensively very well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now shift their focus to Saturday night’s game against Pacific, which fell 67-62 against Cal Poly last night. Despite the loss, the Tigers sit in second place in the Big West with a 13-9 overall record and 7-3 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>“I can’t see this basketball team beating Pacific without hitting threes,” Coach Williams said. “We’re going to have to just keep grinding and shoot the ball better.”</p>\n<p>With 10 teams in the Big West this season, only the top eight will advance to the conference tournament. Now with only seven conference games remaining, UCSB must win immediately if it wants to play well into March.</p>\n<p>“We’ve just got to come together and figure it out and win some games,” Big Al said. “It’s not about X’s and O’s or anything like that, it’s about our heart and our determination and our pride in going out there and representing UCSB basketball in the best way we can, and right now, we’re not doing that.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday night’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/","id":670,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[669,668,667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A Day in the Life of Kirsten Tilleman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the UCSB roster, Kirsten Tilleman is listed as a senior, but she is definitely no ordinary student athlete.

One of two players to start every game she’s played in, she’s a vital part of the Gaucho squad, averaging 30.5 minutes per game, which is second on the team.</p>\n<p>Tilleman is also one of Santa Barbara’s best defenders. She ranks second on the team and fourth in the Big West in defensive rebounds, grabbing 5.3 boards per game (averages 7.3 total) and is tied for first on the team in steals with 0.9 per contest. Finally, with 0.7 blocks per game, she leads the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>So how does Tilleman do it all? Well, her formula is, “basketball, school, dinner, (school) work, repeat.” Obviously it’s not that simple though, so I was given the opportunity to shadow Tilleman for a day and see what a day in her shoes is really like.</p>\n<p>It’s Monday morning and Tilleman’s day starts at the Thunderdome. She gets there at 8:30 a.m., which is a bit earlier than usual because the team has to retake its team picture.</p>\n<p>Afterward, they change into practice gear and head into the film room, where they look at the game they played two days before in Hawaii (a 51-50 victory that handed Hawaii its first home loss during conference play). Head Coach Carlene Mitchell examines the team’s man defense, missed block-outs, screen-and-roll plays and more. A win is a win, but there’s still plenty to work on.</p>\n<p>They also go over their basketball tests, a test given by Mitchell to look at the player’s basketball IQs. Sitting in the back left corner of the room, Tilleman is quick to answer any questions asked by Mitchell, exemplifying her comprehensive knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>Practice starts just before 10:00, beginning with warm-ups and stretches. Tilleman leads the pack and is the first to get to the ball rack when the players are instructed to start shooting drills. Since coming to UCSB, Tilleman — one of the team captains this year — has been known to lead by example with her blue-collar mentality.</p>\n<p>She dons a blue practice jersey, the straps tucked into her sports bra. On the back reads the number 32; it’s the number she’s worn all her life and the number her mom wore.</p>\n<p>On the first shooting drill, which involves grabbing a ball out of a chair, ripping and then taking a lay-up or jump shot, Tilleman makes all her lay-ups but the last one. She still made 90 percent of them, but as Mitchell looks over and sees Tilleman miss, the sound of “finish Tilleman” echoes through the gym.</p>\n<p>While she’s not taking her turn, she encourages her teammates. As she continues to run through the multiple shooting drills, her shot looks consistent. Nevertheless, as she misses a couple in a row, she mumbles a cuss word under her breath. It’s one of the charming things I’ve learned to look for while watching Tilleman play over the past year-and-a-half.</p>\n<p>Not to say that Tilleman goes around swearing all the time — because she certainly does not — but she’s a perfectionist, and her efforts produce results. Currently, last year’s Big West Tournament MVP is averaging 5.5 points per game and shooting 51.4 percent in conference play. In UCSB’s most recent game against Cal State Fullerton, Tilleman exploded for a season-high 16 points and eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Moving onto power layups, Tilleman’s power is apparent. She might not be the quickest or the most athletic, but she is strong, physical and knows how to use her body.</p>\n<p>Next on the practice agenda is going through all the offensive patterns. She’s vocal while running plays, constantly communicating with her teammates.</p>\n<p>Then, while sitting out, the second group makes a mistake on a play. From about halfcourt where the rest of the players are standing, Tilleman is very vocal. She points and yells where they need a ball screen and I can finally see for myself how she’s grown as a vocal leader.</p>\n<p>Practice ends after about an hour. While drills are at game speed, Mitchell decides to run a short practice considering the team got back to Santa Barbara from its trip to Hawaii the morning before after a red-eye flight.</p>\n<p>We walk over to the ICA where Tilleman gets started on weights around 11:00. We’re ahead of most of the team as Tilleman knows she’s got things to do and doesn’t want to waste time. She works through a circuit of exercises, including slides with a rubber band around her ankles, squats and abs.</p>\n<p>During the exercises, Tilleman can laugh and talk with her teammates and I catch glimpses of that infectious smile. She balances socializing and working, never falling off task. After about a half hour, she heads into the training room to do some exercises for her knees because, as she said herself, “my knees suck.”</p>\n<p>With the basketball portion of the day done, we walk over to the other side of campus where the Bren School is located. She takes me out to Deckers Deck, which has an amazing view of the ocean. We eat lunch there and talk. She has a leftover sweet potato curry dish for lunch, which smelled amazing. Tilleman loves to cook; it’s one of the things she does to take a break from her schoolwork. After all, you have to eat.</p>\n<p>The conversation flows easily; she’s so personable and genuine. Despite me following her, she tried to make me feel comfortable the entire day.</p>\n<p>She explains how she graduated in three years from Oregon State University, but only played two years of basketball. While she completely supports the program now, it wasn’t the right fit for her and so she decided to take her last year off and study hard to graduate in three years, leaving her with two years of NCAA eligibility. She eventually decided on UCSB, based on its master’s program first and basketball program second, wanting a program in which she could make an impact and make a run to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Tilleman tries not to talk about herself too much because she doesn’t want to seem conceited. She’s definitely far from being arrogant, but she does throw in that she was a Rhodes Scholarship finalist for District 16 this past fall, an award that combines athletic ability, leadership and academics. While still gracious, her competitive nature comes through. She doesn’t like losing.</p>\n<p>At 1:00 p.m., we head to Tilleman’s only class of the day: ESM 276, or Ethical Decision-Making for the Environment — a two-unit, five-week short course. It’s a much different setup than an undergrad classroom. There are only 15 to 20 people sitting around a conference-style table, not desks.</p>\n<p>Overall, the class is much more applied with a lot more discussion. They applied different ethical models learned in class to different real-world concepts. For example, the class discussed the Tigers Woods scandal and why, unlike the rest of his sponsors, Nike decided to keep him. Beyoncé even came up, too.</p>\n<p>The class ends at 2:15 p.m., after which we head down to the visitors center, where Tilleman is scheduled to meet with her group at 2:30 p.m. to work on their master’s thesis project. At Bren, the GP (for group project) as Tilleman calls it, is done in groups and is unique in that their paper will be able to be used; it won’t just sit on a shelf.</p>\n<p>Tilleman’s master’s program is a two-year program with the master’s thesis being a spring-to-spring project. After finishing the paper, she will have to defend her thesis on March 1, meaning she has to leave the team in between games during its Fullerton and Riverside road trip.</p>\n<p>The project involves coming up with a public access plan for Tejon Ranch, a 270,000 acre ranch north of Bakersfield. In 2008, an agreement was made that said the ranch would conserve 90 percent of its lands as well as create and fund a conservancy (Tilleman’s group’s client) to manage the land. Their product, along with the work of the conservancy, will be the public access plan of the ranch. The overarching mission for Tilleman and her group is to make the resource available to the public while maintaining the integrity of the ranch.</p>\n<p>The first thing Tilleman does is get caught up on what she’s missed during the group’s previous meeting and weekend trip to the ranch due to travelling with the team.</p>\n<p>While Tilleman seems very passionate about her project — and it’s certainly clear she’s put a ton of work, time and effort into it — I see a bit of stress on her face as she knows the paper isn’t magically going to just come together. The group has set an internal deadline to have the paper done by Feb. 10 so they then can have time to edit before sending it off to ‘defense.’ As she said, “we’re in crunch time.”</p>\n<p>During her group meeting is where I could truly tell the difference between grad and undergrad work as information started flying over my head. There’s so much they have to consider with their project. That day alone, they discussed trails and hikes, such as a loop trail for their case study, how to label them, where to put them and more.</p>\n<p>Finally, after meeting for about two hours, we head back to Tilleman’s apartment. It seems like a peaceful place for her where she can just get work done (there’s no TV). She makes both of us tea from Montana, exhibiting her motto “when in doubt, drink tea.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, her passion for the environment is clear. While she’s not 100 percent certain of her path after graduating in the spring, she’s interested in working in city government and dealing with water management or land use for recreational purposes.</p>\n<p>For my last question of the day, I ask her how she manages everything. Her response is simple, but speaks the truth: “You just make time.” While it can be difficult, like on road trips when there’s no electrical outlet on the bus so her computer will die, making homework virtually impossible to do, she knows what she has to do and makes those things her priorities.</p>\n<p>But here’s the difference between Tilleman and the majority of students at UCSB: She isn’t just making time and she isn’t just doing a lot. She’s doing it all extremely well.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/","id":667,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[666,665,664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeks to Break Four-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will attempt to break its season high four-game losing streak tonight when they host UC Davis at the Thunderdome.

If UCSB hopes to outpace a dangerous Davis offense this time around, they might need another solid night from Williams.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins leads Davis and the Big West in scoring with 19.4 points per game. Last time out against Santa Barbara, Hawkins scored 23 points on an efficient 7-11 from the field. Earlier this season against Hawaii, Hawkins led the Aggies to a 93-82 victory by registering a career-high and school record 40 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to keep him under control,” Coach Williams said. “We can’t let him go off like he did at Hawaii. We have to be aware of where he is and not let him have easy looks.”</p>\n<p>During the four-game losing streak, UCSB had a chance to win every game but came up short in each. The four losses came by a combined total of 15 points, the last two each by a two-point margin.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us right now,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to go out there and string some wins together [and] try to get some momentum for the end of the season.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB previously faced Davis, sophomore guard T.J. Taylor was the only other Gaucho to score in double figures aside from Williams with 10 points. Santa Barbara will need to see plenty of scoring from junior guard Kyle Boswell and freshman forward Taran Brown this time around if it wants to beat Davis.</p>\n<p>One of the major emphases for UCSB entering tonight’s game will be slowing down Davis’ outside game, as the Aggies are one of the top shooting teams in the conference. Davis ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage, highlighting the Aggies as a dangerous and efficient team from anywhere on the floor.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/","id":668,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[667,666,665],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Back to Winning Ways","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All season long, the UCSB women’s basketball team has said its defense fuels its offense.

Any time you win on the road, you have to be satisfied with that even though we know it wasn’t a pretty 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB took advantage from the high post, breaking down Davis’ trapping defense. Senior forward Sweets Underwood and senior guard Angelei Aguirre both played the elbow spot, combining for 27 points.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of our hits were in the high post and that’s something that we really worked on — that high-post shot, whether it was high low or short corner — the ball has to go in and out and I think we did an awesome job rotating the ball in and out,” Underwood said. “That’s how Lei and I were able to get some open looks.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game hot on the offensive end, using 66.7 percent shooting to put together a 13-4 run and take an early 23-12 lead.</p>\n<p>“I think we just executed offensively, which got us open shots,” Aguirre said. “We were able to take our time and knock them down.”</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies returned the favor as they went on an 8-0 run of their own to get within three points. That’s when UCSB picked up its defense, which sparked a 6-0 run as the Gauchos finished the half with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Playing well from the opening tip has been a crucial key for Santa Barbara as the team is now 9-1 when leading at the half.</p>\n<p>“You always want to go into halftime feeling good about yourselves and then come out with even more energy, so that first half lead was very critical for us,” Underwood said.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, sophomore forward Sydnee Fipps found her stride offensively, scoring 10 of the Aggies first 14 points of the half to get her team back in the game. Fipps finished with a game-high 16 points.</p>\n<p>“[Fipps is] a great player,” Mitchell said. “She has an attack mentality and we have to do a better job of guarding off the dribble.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also suffered from a six-minute scoring drought in the middle of the second half, caused by unforced turnovers, allowing the Aggies to go on a 9-2 run and close the gap to one point at 44-43. On the night, UCSB turned the ball over 22 times compared to 16 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We made a lot of critical mistakes offensively, turning the ball over, when we didn’t need to,” Underwood said. “They executed off of our turnovers, so it was us beating up on ourselves.”</p>\n<p>The game remained close throughout the rest of the half and Davis once again cut the lead to one with 2:58 remaining.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB persevered. Senior center Kirsten Tilleman knocked down two free throws to make the score 54-51 with just over a minute to go. Out of a timeout, Davis managed to get off a three-point shot, but UCSB was able to earn the stop, allowing junior guard Nicole Nesbit to ice the game at the free throw line hitting both attempts.</p>\n<p>“We just focused on defense,” Aguirre said. “They’re a systems team, so we knew what they’re running, and so we just had to focus and not make any mental mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara outrebounded the Aggies 34-24 and outshot Davis 47.8 percent to 34.7 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had extremely balanced scoring on the night as well with three players finishing in double figures. Nesbit tallied 13 points and five assists on the night while Aguirre contributed 12 points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>Underwood led the Gauchos with 15 points and 12 rebounds for her eighth double-double of the season. Finally, Tilleman posted a solid night, finishing with eight points and seven boards, and junior guard Melissa Zornig scored eight points, including two critical threes down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“I was proud of our team that we were able to buckle down and win a close game and be able to execute and hit shots and most importantly, get stops when it counted,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its road trip north against Big West leader Pacific this Saturday.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/","id":669,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[668,667,666],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
