She also wants to create a program for sexual assault awareness training, similar to the one all Greek life members undergo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to reach out to students in I.V. and on campus to make them aware of what A.S. does and what resources are available to them. She would also like to work with the police in I.V. to mediate student relations and advocate for survivor-oriented sexual assault policies.</span></p>\n<p><b>POLICE PRESENCE IN I.V.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes relying on UCIV, a volunteer group that offers assistance to partygoers during weekends, as student liaisons between students and police is the right step. She wants to move toward community policing because she believes the police presence in I.V. makes people uncomfortable.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to hold forums with police officers at least once a quarter to ease relations between students and officers. She also aims to create an environment where students feel comfortable reaching out to police for help.</span></p>\n<p><b>HALLOWEEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico believes Halloween in recent years has seen I.V. become a police state and said most people spend Halloween out of town. She wants to implement different events in I.V. so that students can enjoy Halloween in I.V. without partying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to work on opening up conversations, citing the CSD’s Deltopia Town Hall as an example of a productive discussion. She also wants to reach out to students who are usually not involved in these spaces and work with the CSD to ensure that student safety is the top priority. </span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator for the EVPLA office in which she was the liaison between the campus community and the CSD. She also helped the CSD implement a policy internship for students to give them experience in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer spoke about her work canvassing for Measures E and F as well as her experience in Campus Democrats, which allowed her to make connections with Congressman Salud Carbajal as well as Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico spoke about her plan to utilize the width of I.V. streets to implement slanted parking on one side and parallel parking on the other, which would open up many more parking spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer wants to maximize the space in I.V. that is already available as well as work with the future A.S. President to make on-campus parking cheaper so commuter students avoid parking in I.V. and taking up spaces for I.V. residents. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The committee discussed specific details of the various event and art installation ideas, and members said they hope to see their plans come to fruition in the weeks surrounding the May 23 tragedy’s anniversary.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy opened the meeting by restating the special committee’s objective to plan an event that reflects the student body and I.V. community’s needs.</p>\n<p>“I really want this to be something community-generated, something that feels organic and that the community would want to see happen,” Guthy said. “It shouldn’t be something that’s official or that we need to do just because we should. It’s whatever’s right for us.”</p>\n<p>Guthy told the committee that A.S. would help with a candlelight vigil on May 23 which she said will be similar to the vigil A.S. hosted in the days following last year’s tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Associated Students is interested in helping to facilitate a memorial walk/candlelight vigil like we did last year,” Guthy said. “That is one of the events that I personally would like to attend and see as a member of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the Surf Club will likely help with a memorial paddle-out similar to last year’s, which would take place sometime during the week after the anniversary.</p>\n<p>“We’ve spoken with Surf Club, who hosted that last year, and they’ve expressed interest in hosting another one,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board Commissioner and fourth-year global studies major Benjamin Simons said the board would be able to provide logistical support for the May 23 vigil.</p>\n<p>“We would like to help really put on the vigil,” Simon said. “We will be providing our sound system like we did last time and security like we did last time.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould encouraged A.S. to end the walk at Perfect Park, because IVRPD will be dedicating a memorial garden there on May 16.</p>\n<p>“We could have a stage or speakers at the end to incorporate the memorial garden,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Spatial Studies Professor in the art department Professor Kim Yasuda said there will likely be an art installation in Perfect Park if A.S. and the art department can gather funds to commission Bamboo DNA Founder Gerard Minakawa, who has designed structures for music festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, to create something for the anniversary memorial.</p>\n<p>“[He] is very interested in contributing his artistic ability … to do something appropriate that would be an illuminated structure,” Yasuda said. “Our goal is that it would be the start of a structure or even a sculpture in that park and that it becomes kind of a centerpiece.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said members of the art department are collaborating on a concept of a blue LED-lit pathway from campus to I.V. that would line the silent walk portion of the May 23 vigil and create a “collective force.”</p>\n<p>“I think a concept that would be really powerful would be if we started to light things in May and then people, businesses, community members started contributing to this blue light,” Yasuda said. “Then, by the 23rd, it’s kind of an experiment in how people build solidarity.”</p>\n<p>The art department is exploring ways to allow individual students to place the LED lights, so students who cannot or choose not to participate in the vigil can express support for the remembrance events, according to Yasuda.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to get all stakeholders contributing something together,” said Yasuda. “If we started in May, it could accumulate by social media.”</p>\n<p>Education and Outreach Coordinator at UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program and alumnus Marjan Riazi said the C.A.P.S. clinical staff will make themselves available at the vigil to support students in need of their services.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the clinical staff would be happy to be there as emergency first responders for people who are triggered,” Riazi said.</p>\n<p>Guthy said the committee is still making decisions on how they will use university emails and social media to publicize the events once plans are finalized.<br>\n“We want to get the information out — at least about the dates — sooner rather than later,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate, by a secret vote of six-to-one, a resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Israel-Palestine region.</p>\n<p>The one dissenting vote, made public shortly after the vote was taken, came from off-campus Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh. The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), urges the UC Board of Regents to withdraw its investments from companies selling arms and weapons to the Israeli government for or by the Israeli military on the grounds that such companies profit off of the military occupation of Palestinian-controlled territories, and that such investments are contrary to the obligation of the UC to promote equality and human rights for all.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row a divestment resolution related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been brought before the Senate, with prior iterations of the bill defeated in the past two years. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution at their weekly meeting next Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the idea of tabling the resolution came in light of Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, which takes place next Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>“While this resolution has been moved to committee and is expected to go out to the student senate, there are those who bring forward the idea that there is a Jewish holiday next week that would require it to be pushed another week,” Goodman said. “There is no one who is not Jewish who can tell me or the Jewish community that our holiday … is a reason not to bring this forward.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said he urged action on the resolution in order to allow the Senate to move forward on to other issues and also opposed further postponing a vote on the resolution.</p>\n<p>“Actually, it’s really patronizing for someone to have proposed that there are Jewish reasons, … that they, out their sensitivity for me and my community, would not want to bring it up,” Goodman said. “So I urge you to pass this out of committee so the Senate can deal with it and the campus can go on to dealing with this and other issues.”</p>\n<p>SJP member Nia, who requested to not have her full name disclosed, said she supported tabling the resolution for an additional week in light of Yom HaShoah.</p>\n<p>“It’s SJP’s mission to work against all forms of oppression, so we feel it’s really important to recognize that and honor that day for all Jewish students, and just let them know that we stand in solidarity … and recognize that and push it back another week so that it’s not at a time when a lot of people are sensitive,” Nia said.</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Niki Elyasi said she found it “patronizing” and “offensive” to push the resolution vote back another week.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the week after week four, April 23rd, is Yom Hazikaron [Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism], so if you are doing your Jewish holiday searching you didn’t do an amazing job because … you’d have to wait ’til week five if that’s your logic,” Elyasi said. “Also to say that you are standing in solidarity with Jewish students when Jewish students feel attacked by a resolution that you’re bringing up to me is just a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said she was concerned about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement’s insistence upon the “Right of Return” for the 700,000 Palestinian refugees that are said to have been forcibly removed or evacuated from the territory that now constitutes the political boundaries of Israel.</p>\n<p>“If the Palestinians who no longer live in Israel were to return to Israel that would mean Israelis would be a minority, so Israel would cease to exist in its current state,” Moreh said. “To my understanding, that would mean the end of Israel.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur defended the passage of the resolution and said allowing Palestinian refugees return would not threaten Israeli sovereignty.</p>\n<p>“We at SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) absolutely stand by the Right of Return,” Kaur said. “We believe the people that were kicked out of their homeland have the right to return. However, I do challenge the notion that that would destroy the state of Israel altogether.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said she believes in the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that one people’s self-determination has to mean the end of another’s,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he advocated for the ability of students from both the Jewish and Palestinian community to make an effort to listen to empathize with one another.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been able to have real dialogue between both the Jewish community and the Palestinian community,” Abdalmalik said. “I highly encourage all of you, no matter how much you personally believe in your cause, to reach out across the aisle and to have open conversation that starts with unification between the two sides.”</p>\n<p>According to Abdalmalik, after engaging in discussion about divestment with students from both sides of the issue, he was able to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“I asked a lot of the folks in the Jewish community if you believe that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination — and every one of you said yes,” Abdalmalik said. “And I asked the folks on the other side of the aisle if they believe the Jewish people have the right to self-determination — and they said yes. That, in it of itself, is such a good start to seeing how we can form a resolution that promotes both people’s rights to self-determination.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While the festival’s date in India changes from year to year and took place on March 6 this year, Indus held the event on April 12 due to scheduling conflicts with other events last quarter. This year’s Holi event sold the most colored powder and attracted the largest crowd since Indus began hosting the event in 2013.</p>\n<p>Indus Representative and first-year chemistry major Yash Pal said Holi holds great significance in traditional Indian culture and brings together people from different social classes.</p>\n<p>“It’s meant to bring everybody together, so in India it would be like to celebrate the end of winter, the beginning of spring harvest time, so it’s a happy time,” Pal said. “In India there’s the caste system with lots of divisions, but when people play Holi you’re just supposed to all be wearing the same stuff, nobody knows what division you’re in — you all just get colorful like the same way.”</p>\n<p>According to Pal, UCSB Indus’ Holi event has similar meaning to the traditional celebrations taking place in India.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together,” Pal said. “This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together.”</p>\n<p>Indus Treasurer and third-year economics and mathematics double major Nitin Seelim said not only has the event drawn bigger crowds over the years, there has also been an increase in diversity among the students who attend.</p>\n<p>“It used to be South Asians specifically, but now we are getting more diversity,” Seelim said. “We started selling Holi powder last year and it was first conducted on this campus two years ago. Last year, we had about 1,000 people, now we have over 2,000 people, each year our turnout is much greater, and [we make] more money selling Holi powder which we use to help conduct other events.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At UCSB it does the same thing. It brings everyone together. This is an Indian celebration but there’s a bunch of people here, there’s a bunch of diversity, everyone’s having fun together. – Indus Freshman Representative Yash</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seelim said he believes the Holi event was unique because it was hosted on the beach, making for a more aesthetically pleasing backdrop and easier cleanup.</p>\n<p>“In India it’s usually done on the streets or alleys where people just throw powder at each other. Not the best scene to look at,” Seelim said. “But beside the beach on campus, it’s very nice and much easier to clean up because the beach cleans it up. It happens once a year, a safe party kind of thing, but you get to learn more about the culture of India — how some events happen — and it attracts more people to our club.”</p>\n<p>According to Roshan Roy, Indus social chair and third-year biopsychology major, Holi is a way for the university community to learn more about Indian culture and add more variety to the UCSB social scene.</p>\n<p>“It adds a lot of diversity to our campus and enriches the culture so that we’re not a campus about partying and drinking,” Roy said. “It’s about learning about different cultures and overall just enriching our overall education.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Vinay Gupta said he has attended Holi every year since enrolling at the university when Indus began hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“Holi is growing in a lot of universities,” Gupta said. “It’s kind of becoming like a trend when it originally started as an Indian holiday, mainly because it’s a lot of fun. Everyone’s covered in color so you can’t tell who’s who, so it can make a statement about equality and race.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Jonah Calio said Holi exceeded his expectations and that he plans on attending next year.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it to be as big as it was. It was way more awesome,” Calio said. “I didn’t think I would get this colorful either. I just liked seeing people you know and hitting them with color.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Rachel Fulton said she was also surprised by the event’s turnout.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of people, and it was really fun,” Fulton said. “I didn’t think there was going to be as many people and as fun as it was. It was a good community experience. I really like the whole culture aspect of it, too. Everybody was friends, it doesn’t matter what you were doing; powder was everywhere.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62357\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/holi-moly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62357\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/holi-moly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/holi-moly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/holi-moly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/holi-moly/","id":2816,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2815,2814,2813],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
