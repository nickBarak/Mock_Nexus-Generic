Students are very busy, and that’s why they can’t come. If you need them to answer these questions, maybe email them,” he half-jokingly told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertulis began his presentation, he touched upon UCSB’s recent platinum-level bike friendliness designation, noting that UCSB is one of eight colleges in the nation to receive it and emphasizing the campus’s “unique bike culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, there are almost 1,300 bike trips in a peak 15-minute period. I’ve never seen anything like this… there are definitely unique challenges this campus faces in regards to bikes. Even a freeway can’t handle that many cars in such a short period,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alissa Hummer, director of Campus Planning and Design, explained the campus expansion that the renovated transit plans are meant to address, which include the construction of a new lecture hall that will begin within the next one and a half years, with 540 new faculty residences and a new student housing project in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we need to not have people bike on the interior of campus and just put bike racks on the outside?” Hummer asked. “It’s something to consider. At this point, everything is on the table.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new lecture hall, which is being built to accommodate increased class sizes, will most likely divert bike traffic onto UCen Road, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students understand the constraints of building a new lecture hall, but they understandably have some trepidation. We haven’t yet tried to mix bikes and cars in the same transport lane, but it will only be for about a block,” Hummer said. “In addition, we will most likely need new bike paths coming into the western side of campus to accommodate the new housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence of campus biking is why second-year environmental science major Sophie Roberts, a member of the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, decided to attend the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to maintain the bike paths that we have, and even add new ones because there’s so much bike traffic here already that closing paths could be dangerous,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, I have a class in the Psych Building, and then 10 minutes later I have a class on the other side of campus, and it’s physically impossible for me to get there by walking, which is why it’s so important to me we keep the bike paths.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Samarin, a KTUA consultant, emphasized wanting to clear up misconceptions students might have about the remodelling and removal of various bike paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The university has proposed some things, which are at this point just proposals. We’re here today to listen to feedback and see how people feel,” Samarin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In regards to closing bike paths, that would be for paths that are underused. We might be able to repurpose those for shuttles. It’s not removing paths just to remove them, it would be to accommodate other mobility,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertulis also brought up the idea of autonomous campus shuttles known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles, which are futuristic-looking white shuttles that could hypothetically transport students to opposite ends of campus and provide an alternative mode of transport for students who have trouble walking across campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was speaking to someone who represents the disabled population on campus and currently we have Uber and Lyft reimbursement for students who need a shuttle type of service. But we’re looking at more regular type of shuttle that could come more regularly and serve a larger demographic, if there’s demand,” Samarin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making campus transportation more accessible for disabled individuals was a key point throughout the moderated conversation at the town hall. Currently, making sure handicapped individuals have the transport services they need is one of KTUA’s “number one priorities,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the town hall, Hummer ended her conversation with a question for students and staff alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really have to look at this bike system that was never formally designed but was put together piece by piece by piece. We need to look at how it’s circulating. Are the bones of this system good and just need some tweaking, or is it fundamentally broken and we need to retool it all together?”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

With the talent of players such as Jordan Clarkson, D’angelo Russell and their selection of Brandon Ingram with the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, the Lakers’ next franchise player is no guarantee but could surface in due time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Ingram seemingly poised to become the face of the L.A. franchise, the buzz surrounding the rookie has many convinced that he could eventually carry the torch after potentially being the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting and playing in five summer league games, Ingram averaged 12.2 points per game while shooting 41.2 percent from the field and 25 percent from behind the three-point line. He also averaged 4.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game in addition to playing 27.4 minutes per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly summer league play is no true predictor of how a player will pan out in the long run, especially at the young age of 19 years old, but Ingram displayed some glimpses on the court that could lead to him flourishing within the NBA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for Russell, last year was more of an underwhelming season. In addition to former Head Coach Byron Antom Scott placing Russell in and out of the starting lineup, finding the guard’s role on the team became a little difficult as to whether or not he would play the one or two position while alongside Clarkson in the backcourt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Scott’s coaching scheme seemed to stray away from Russell’s strengths, one can only predict that Walton will be able to conquer the puzzle of Russell and Clarkson after helping coach the NBA’s top backcourt duo in Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Nonetheless, Russell had his spurts in which he showcased his ability to produce when on the court whether scoring or assisting. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72441\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72441\" data-attachment-id=\"72441\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-17/lakers-finalize-training-camp-site-at-ucsb/russell-ice-veins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"russell-ice-veins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?fit=800%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72441\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=399%2C276\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of deadspin.com\" width=\"399\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russell-ice-veins.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of deadspin.com</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the Lakers must focus on training camp and their task of acclimating free agent additions Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng.

Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 were present at Wednesday’s UC Santa Barbara strike. The workers set up their base at Storke Tower but spent much of the day marching around campus in order to draw attention to the union’s demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 — which represents more than 24,000 health care and service employees across the UC system — has been embroiled in contract negotiations with the university for the past two years, and one of its primary demands has been an end to outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This strike was AFSCME 3299’s sixth at UC campuses across the state in the past two years — a point of frustration among many of the workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a custodian at UCSB and an AFSCME 3299 member, said that he was “disappointed” with the number of strikes but added that he felt the only way the university will change its behavior is if the union keeps striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we’re out here again on unfair labor practices has me a little disappointed about making and impact on the way they follow the rules, but I think the only way that we’re ever going to make a change on that is by keep coming out,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paco Garcia, a senior lead laborer in facilities management at UCSB and an AFSCME member, added that union workers “don’t make the cost of living.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t make enough money to live in Santa Barbara, they don’t make enough to go on with their lives, they have to take two jobs,” Garcia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outsourcing is causing people to not have a steady job; it’s causing people to not live at the cost of living, and we want the university to stop breaking the law,” Garcia added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is currently considering a motion that — with a few exceptions — would prohibit outsourcing and adopt contracted workers to the UC’s payroll if they have been working for the UC for over a year.

AFSCME uses strikes as a bargaining tool, he added — the strike forces the university to hire more people to replace the strikers, which in turn provides the UC incentive to listen to the union’s demand that they end illegal outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite AFSCME’s insistence that the strikes are about the illegal outsourcing complaints, UC Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon called the strike a strategy to gain “leverage in negotiations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon added that the union ultimately wants double the wages of other employees and said AFSCME 3299 utilizes the strikes as a mechanism to achieve that goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite union concerns about contracting, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually grown by double digits in the past five years,” Gordon said. “UC’s contracts with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting, and no employee can be terminated as a result of a subcontracting decision.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike saw a degree of student solidarity, such as from Wendy Santamaria, a fourth-year political science and philosophy major, who attended the strike alongside her fellow Students for Bernie organization members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see it as absolutely crucial for us as students to come together with workers,” Santamaria said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as we keep spreading knowledge of the issues workers are facing, [support for the strike] is going to continue to grow,” she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the student support, external groups such as hip-hop duo Rebel Diaz, a Chicago-based group that was on campus Wednesday to </span><a href=\"https://z-m-www.facebook.com/events/990558504623313/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at a separate event, marched through campus with the strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that the struggles they’re fighting for are not just about wages but about this idea of an entire system becoming privatized and the outsourcing of jobs and services that should be publicly funded,” said Rodrigo “RodStarz” Venegas, who is half of Rebel Diaz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez emphasized that “we all want the same thing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all want to make sure that we have a job tomorrow,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
