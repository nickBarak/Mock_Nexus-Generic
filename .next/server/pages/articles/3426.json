The complaints could result in a federal investigation of the university and steep financial penalties if Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Federal Student Aid (FSA) officials deem such action appropriate.</p>\n<p>Colleges and universities are required to disclose information about crimes occurring on and around their campuses via the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, and Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. Both laws are enforced by the Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The complaints were filed with the help of End Rape on Campus (EROC), a sexual assault survivor advocacy group of current and former college students, which assisted the UCSB students in drawing together their complaints based on both Title IX and the Clery Act.</p>\n<p>According to EROC staff member Annie Clark, the Department of Education receives separate complaints pertaining to Title IX and the Clery Act. Clark also said that if the OCR finds a school in violation of Title IX they face what she described as an “all or nothing” penalty.</p>\n<p>“There’s a nuclear option of revoking all federal funding or nothing, which basically means they sit down with the school and the school promises to do better,” Clark said. “There’s no real accountability there.”</p>\n<p>For Clery Act violations, Clark said the Department of Education may levy a fine of up to $35,000 per violation.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking on the Crimmel Case</strong></p>\n<p>Lead complainant and recent UCSB graduate Myra Crimmel said her assault occurred on Sept. 8 of last year and that when she reported it to her crisis counselor at UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), as well as to Judicial Affairs, naming her assailant, she was initially told the evidence presented was so severe the university had an obligation to pursue her case.</p>\n<p>According to CARE Director Jill Dunlap, CARE counselors assist those on campus impacted by sexual violence by supporting their decision whether or not to report the incident through official channels, as well as by accompanying the formation of a report and serving as a support person through subsequent processes.</p>\n<p>“CARE advocates are available to support a survivor through any reporting process,” Dunlap said in an email, “including campus judicial processes, as well as criminal law enforcement proceedings.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56091\" style=\"width: 199px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"757508921\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56091\" data-attachment-id=\"56091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"498,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56091\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=189%2C190\" alt=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" width=\"189\" height=\"190\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp;

After the attorneys got involved however, various meetings between her alleged assailant and Judicial Affairs were canceled, allowing the accused to “stonewall” the case by delaying a decision, Crimmel said.</p>\n<p>“I expressed my need for the case to end in a timely manner, which the Code of Student Conduct promised me,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “Instead, I was told ‘these things take time’ and that there was nothing I could do in the meantime. I was told that ‘the system is the way it is, you need to let it play out.’”</p>\n<p>At this time Crimmel said Judicial Affairs assured her in December her alleged perpetrator would be kept from enrolling in future classes with her. Yet when she began class Winter quarter, long after the promised 60 day limit for case resolution, Crimmel found her alleged assailant attending one of her classes. Mid-way through last Winter quarter, Crimmel’s alleged assailant requested a hearing with Crimmel while she said she distressed over moving forward and risking her case getting dropped completely in the event she lost.</p>\n<p>Crimmel also said a representative from Judicial Affairs and her crisis counselor at this point began discouraging her from going through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>“[The Judicial Affairs officer] also told me … ‘I don’t want you to go through it’ and ‘It is so much work on our end.’ I felt helpless because my crisis counselor was my only ally and was unfamiliar with the adjudication process,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “[The crisis counselor] told me that during her time of employment there, she has never seen a sexual assault case result in a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Crimmel opted not to go through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, she said Judicial Affairs had contacted her father and informed him that Crimmel’s alleged assailant had refused to admit guilt and that neither the incident nor the sanctions would appear on the student’s transcript or criminal record.</p>\n<p>According to correspondence between Crimmel and Judicial Affairs provided by Crimmel, her case was closed March 4, 2014 and her alleged assailant was permitted to take his Winter quarter finals before withdrawing from the university until Fall 2014, after Crimmel’s graduation, where he was allowed to attend on disciplinary probation.</p>\n<p>“By refusing to accept responsibility and using his attorneys, he guaranteed that there would be no trace of what happened or why he temporarily left UCSB,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “How will students be safe when a perpetrator can return to the campus after facing virtually no consequences other than some lost time and a quarter-long suspension?”</p>\n<p><strong>The Aftermath: Filing the Complaint</strong></p>\n<p>Director of Judicial Affairs Stephan Franklin said he could not offer comment on the complaint and that punishments for perpetrators of such cases vary considerably depending on individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Public Affairs also released a statement that said the university takes “students’ reports of sexual assault extremely seriously” and that they offer counseling, support and advocacy resources, as well as a “comprehensive adjudication process” to those impacted by sexual assault.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55124\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"524382703\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55124\" data-attachment-id=\"55124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/doe-official-discusses-sexual-assault/lhamon-media2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=1538%2C849&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1538,849\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"SLT-A57\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398856647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=888%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-55124\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21-1024x565.jpg?resize=342%2C195\" alt=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" width=\"342\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=342%2C195 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=342%2C195 1026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education Catherine Lhamon met with student leaders on sexual assault this past Spring.</p></div>\n<p>According to Dunlap, CARE interacts with students based on the “empowerment model,” designed to give students more control over their options after an assault. She also said CARE program staff are currently collaborating with the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment/Title IX Compliance to develop a faculty guide for “responding to disclosures from survivors of interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important that the student be in charge of their own recovery process,” Dunlap said in an email, “and CARE staff are here to support whatever decisions they make.”</p>\n<p>According to a spokesperson with the Department of Education who wished to remain anonymous, the Office for Civil Rights does not confirm the receipt of complaints and “will inform the institution, the complainant and the public as appropriate.” A staffer with the Department of Education’s San Francisco Office, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the evaluation of Title IX complaints from the time the complaint is received to the notification of complaint investigation or dismissal usually takes 30 calendar days.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, co-chair of campus sexual assault survivor advocacy group Take Back the Night, said the university must make strides to better combat sexual violence and provide sexual assault response resources that are swift, effective and accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“You can do a Judicial Affairs complaint, but right now there’s no one on campus besides Take Back the Night and CARE who tells students that that is an available option,” third-year English and Feminist Studies double major Kauffman said. “Most students have no idea that that they can even do that, and if they do know that they can do that, they don’t know where to go. They don’t know who to talk to. They don’t know anything.”</p>\n<p>According to Crimmel, the driving force motivating her to file the federal complaint is the hope that it will “ bring justice to those silenced by trauma.”</p>\n<p>“I was victimized twice, both by my perpetrator and my university, but the silver lining is that I am now more strong and resilient,” Crimmel said in her complaint. “Going forward, prompt action must be taken against perpetrators of sexual assaults, and survivors must be treated with respect. What happens in Isla Vista does not stay here. Things must change.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor-in-chief Carissa Quiambao contributed to this report.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Clothing choice obviously isn’t the only barometer for school spirit, but the truth remains that some colleges and their students revel in the concept of an exclusive identity and the bonds that come with it far more than others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sense of community, of belonging, is often both reflected in and created by college sports.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to see this in the powerhouse schools across the country. Alabama’s football team literally brings together an entire city and surrounding areas on Saturdays to watch the game; Duke and the University of North Carolina have created metaphorical fortresses just 15 minutes away from each other with their men’s basketball teams; the University of Connecticut formed a women’s basketball empire that draws thousands of students to fill their arena just to watch their team on the big screen when they make it to March Madness. While how much of this is just young people wanting to fit in and get drunk on the weekends while watching the game and how much is a genuine feeling of community and school spirit (and just how different these two things are) is up for debate, there’s no doubt that these effects of sports on a college campus are very real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does this play out at a football-less mid-major school here at UCSB? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand this relationship between sports and how we form community as Gauchos now, we first have to look at how we did it in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the NCAA and college sports did not exist as both the financial and social institutions they are now in the early days of UCSB, our sports teams certainly did have a presence. Even as far as 70 years ago, the Nov. 16, 1945 edition of the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (then known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">El Gaucho</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) recapped our men’s basketball team’s 36-25 victory over the Marines by pointing out how our “capacity crowd” helped will the Gauchos to victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forty five years later, our basketball stadium earned its “Thunderdome” moniker because of how raucous the crowds were in our victory over the highly esteemed University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels. Students literally camped outside the ‘Dome the night before to wait in line for tickets, and footage from the inside on game day showed a crowd that almost makes the Cameron Crazies pale in comparison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This still holds true in the recent past. From 2000-2015, we hosted seven out of the top 10 highest attended regular season soccer games in NCAA history, won the NCAA College Cup and also hosted the UNC basketball team here at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over all these years UCSB built up a strong reputation nationwide as a “party school,” even without a football team for most of it. Students were able to mix the relative freedom and separation that Isla Vista offers with school spirit and community that is centered around our sports teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was not the UCSB I came to in the Fall 2016, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injuries, fatigue and just a lack of enthusiasm seemed to plague most of the sports teams my freshman year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our men’s basketball squad finished 6-22 and had some of the lowest attendance numbers in years; our men’s soccer team finished 10-7-3 and lost in their first match in the Big West tournament; our baseball team fresh off a remarkable College World Series run went 24-32 and weren’t even close to sniffing the postseason and although our women’s basketball team had a surprisingly good postseason run, they ultimately dropped the Big West Tournament championship game and ended with a 16-16 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really did feel like a fragmented campus in many ways. While people were able to find community on campus in other ways, whether it be through clubs, fraternities or just their dormmates, there was never really a time or place that I felt connected to the student body as a whole  other than our school-sanctioned concerts and one Blue-Green rivalry soccer game against Cal Poly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It only took one year, and a historic basketball season, for that to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When our men’s basketball team started off the 2017-18 season with a 9-2 record led by new Head Coach Joe Pasternack and star junior guard Max Heidegger, students began to get curious. It was my first year covering the team and when I interviewed Coach Pasternack in the preseason, he emphasized over and over again the importance of getting the campus involved with the team for the benefit of the students and the players. I thought he was being overly optimistic at the least and that perhaps spending so much time as a coach at the University of Arizona had skewed his perception, that it wasn’t really possible to bring people together here in the way he claimed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then students started to show up to the games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowly but surely attendance started rising, and our team became the talk of the town. I heard conversations about UCSB basketball in the dining commons, in class, even in random places I.V. It seemed as if people were just waiting for something to cheer for, for something or someone to rally around, for a way to express their pride in being a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ended up having the best home record and home crowd in the Big West, culminating with a packed house of 4,833 students in our season finale beatdown of Cal Poly. I remember looking up and seeing the packed stands that night, seeing everyone in blue and gold cheering on the team and thinking that this is what community feels like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, just a year later, we have the opportunity to make our own mark on UCSB sports history. Our men’s volleyball team reached as high as a No. 3 rank this season and packed Roberson Gym with eager fans during the games; our men’s basketball team again had an incredible season and actually saw attendance numbers rise; both tennis teams have been running through their competitions; our women’s water polo team was nationally ranked and our baseball team has put together the best season in program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sports renaissance has not just been great for sportswriters and stat-geeks like me but has also given incoming and continuing students a chance to go cheer our teams on and be a part of their success as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB might never be a sports powerhouse, while we might never get a football team or have tailgating opportunities, we’ve shown that we have the ability to find a sense of community in the teams we do have, and as long as our teams keep improving, so will our school spirit.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Nestled in the Central Coast, Isla Vista is only a short drive from iconic surf locales like Rincon, Emma Wood, C Street and Jalama, while also boasting its own local gems like Sands and Devereux. The easy access of some of the best surf spots on the West Coast is one of the primary reasons fourth-year Surf Team members DaniRose Hill and Jessica Bixby chose UCSB over schools like UC Berkeley, where they were both accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think just coming to Santa Barbara, and feeling how welcoming this community was, has to do with how close we are to the water,” Bixby explained. “I knew that my soccer career was coming to an end, so when I was visiting schools I was like, ‘I could start surfing all the time if I went here.’ So I think that a huge factor for me was like I can be in the ocean all the time in Santa Barbara.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The water is what keeps me mentally balanced and happy, and I knew that I wanted to be around it,” Hill added.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I.V. may seem to be a haven to those who share a love of the ocean, struggles for female surfers lurk just below the surface. Kaira Wallace, co-captain of the UCSB Surf Team, noted that sexism runs rampant — even in a tight-knit community so focused on positivity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Sexism] comes in different forms. Men will paddle by you and be like, ‘Oh, getting any waves?’ and you’re like, ‘Yes, I’m getting waves. Did you ask this man over here if he was getting any waves?’” Wallace said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like you definitely have to prove yourself a little bit more. Every time I go out I like thinking in my head like, ‘Don’t fuck up.’ Cause if someone’s easy to fuck up then they’re not going to take you seriously,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lily Day, a fourth-year Surf Team member agrees. “I feel like you really have to earn your place. You’re marked from when you first paddle out. The first wave is so important, because if I fall or eat shit, then all the guys know they can drop in on my waves, or won’t respect me,” Day said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gender barrier didn’t completely dissipate within the confines of the team. Even outside the water, gender roles in years past caused tension amongst team members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a tendency for some older guys on the team to have the position and kind of play the mascot in this role, of getting to do the fun things and shout into a megaphone and kind of get all of the credit,” Hill noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But behind the scenes they weren’t running any of the logistics and a lot of the girls for a lot of years had the job of being the bitch. We were the ones that were pestering people and getting things done and kind of doing all the grunt work that isn’t fun and doesn’t make you likable,” she said frankly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gendered aspect of the sport is nothing new to the women. Growing up, all of them faced similar experiences of discrimination on the basis of sex. It certainly didn’t help that by the time they reached high school, the number of female surfers dwindled to a number you could count on one hand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As soon as you got into the high school surf team there was like maybe one or two other girls on the team tops,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though they constantly found themselves outnumbered during their formative years, the women all held out hope for a more female future in the sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some ways it was a lot harder to build confidence because I wasn’t doing it alongside other girls. I always knew that I was like standing alone and navigating it alone, despite guy friends that I had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t feel like I had that pack to lean on. I didn’t have other girls to look up to to go, ‘Oh, I can surf like that one day.’ I could only find that really through the media. But in another way, at times, I derive confidence from it just because I knew that one day there would be more girls, you know, if those few people that are on the team don’t keep surfing, then there will be no foundation for more girls.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the negativity, both Bixby and Hill recall their late mentors — Bixby’s father Mark and Hill’s coach Stan Searfus — both of whom helped normalize women in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first time I really felt my gender in the water, my mentor Stan saw how excited I was to surf. He invited me on a six-mile paddle and I was the only girl there. And some of the guys were kind of surprised that I showed up. There was classic boy banter. I wasn’t supposed to hear it but one of them said, ‘What is she doing here?’ Stan went up to them and said, ‘Well she’s out here, she’s doing this paddle and she’s going to be surfing with us, so get used to it,’ and that was so foundational to me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the women, the UCSB Surf Team proved a massive improvement, boasting a whopping five women their freshman year. It has since grown to more than 20. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think each year it’s just more exciting. Getting to college, I remember even being so stoked to be on a team with like five girls — that was mind blowing. And then the next year it was 12 girls at a competition all surfing together, like in the water dominating the lineup. Each year it’s increasing and it’s just makes you feel so much more comfortable in the water. People are more accepting and it’s more fun environment. Whereas I think when there’s too many men present, it just feels so competitive and like quiet. But I think women really liven up that environment,” Bixby concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the surf team has increased four-fold since Hill, Bixby and Wallace first joined the team in 2016, the fight for equality isn’t over yet. When asked to give advice to future generations of female surfers, Wallace doesn’t mince words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t take shit from any fucking guy out there. Do not take shit from him because you just like being in the water, you’ve overcome so much more than he ever will.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

By contrast, that surplus has since vanished and the state is now facing an estimated $54.3 billion deficit, The Sacramento Bee </span><a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article242741996.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC will lose an additional $34.4 million in funding for its president’s office, UCPath and the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and $4 million in summer financial aid, according to the revised budget.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the proposed budget cuts, UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-statement-may-revision-gov-newsom-s-budget\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Thursday that the “UC stands with the governor and the legislature to help lift the State out of this economic crisis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gov.
