UCSB took that opportunity and swept the week with a 75-66 win over the Titans and a 70-56 victory over the Aggies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two wins pushed the Gauchos’ record to 18-9 this season and 7-5 in conference play. That conference mark is good enough for second in the Big West, a half-game ahead of UCD and three-and-a-half behind UC Irvine.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos seemed determined to make the most of their opportunity immediately on Thursday evening. UCSB opened the game on an 11-0 run in the first three minutes, with graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman contributing 7 of the points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Matt Freeman had a monster first four minutes of the game,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “That really got us going.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloodied as they were by the Gauchos’ opening volley, the Titans showed no sign of quitting on their home court. Slowly and surely, Fullerton dragged their way into contention, at one point narrowing the UCSB lead to 2 points and went into the locker room down by 34-29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos maintained their advantage for the much of the second half but were unable to reopen their lead into the double-digits. Fullerton kept on hanging around, waiting for the opportunity to make their move.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That opportunity finally presented itself just after the eight-minute mark of the second half. The Titans stitched together the right combination of buckets and stops and took a 56-55 lead, their first of the game, with 7:34 to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baskets from each of Fullerton’s top three players — senior forward Jackson Rowe, graduate transfer guard Brandon Kamga and senior guard Austen Awosika — pushed the Titan lead to 63-59 with 5:40 left and forced UCSB onto its back foot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos responded to the reversal of fortunes with vigor. UCSB closed out the game on a 16-3 run for the 75-66 victory, giving the game a symmetrical appearance with Gaucho runs to open and close the proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Max Heidegger scored 8 of UCSB’s final 16 points and finished with a game-high 27 points. Heidegger also pulled down 7 rebounds and passed out 5 assists, making for a well-rounded performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger’s 7 boards tied him with junior guard Devearl Ramsey for a team-high rebound count. Neither Heidegger, at 6’3”, or Ramsey, at 6’ even, have anything resembling a height advantage on the glass, but both guards found a way to find the ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s matchup was the first between UCSB and Fullerton this season, giving the Gauchos their first chance to take on the team that knocked them out of the Big West Tournament last season. While the Titans are a much different team this season than they were last year, the element of revenge likely made the win just a little sweeter for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revenge was also at play on Saturday night against UC Davis. The Aggies came into the Thunderdome on a four-game winning streak, including an 84-75 win over UCSB last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out of the gate looking like a team intent on vengeance — perhaps a little too intent. UCSB committed 6 turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game, enabling UCD to jump out to an early 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like we were just a little anxious,” Ramsey said. “We just wanted to get out there and play really hard and we just had to channel our energy in the right way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a few minutes, but the Gauchos eventually managed to settle down and stop giving the ball away. Once that happened, UCSB was able to chip away, slowly but surely, at the Davis lead with good defense and some solid interior play by sophomore forward Amadou Sow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tip-in by junior guard Brandon Cyrus and a jumper by Heidegger brought the Gauchos within 2 points of the Aggies and forced UCD Head Coach Jim Les to call a timeout with 7:15 left in the half. That timeout did nothing to stop the Davis slide, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies turned the ball over immediately out of the timeout and suddenly, Ramsey  was everywhere. The point guard knocked down a 3, made a layup and knocked down another 3, all in the span of about 70 seconds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My teammates were just finding me, and in transition, I’m always going to try to push the pace,” Ramsey said. “Amadou had me on the skip [pass] and Max had me on the skip [pass]; those guys got me and I just hit my shots.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramsey’s one-man run pushed UCSB into the lead with 5:28 to go in the first half and energized the Thunderdome crowd. Freeman knocked down 2 free throws a few minutes later to make the score 31-21, but a couple of scores by Aggie senior guard Joe Mooney cut the deficit to 31-26 going into the locker room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither the Gauchos nor the Aggies were able to break away from the other for most of the second half. UCSB held onto their lead, but UCD managed to answer seemingly every basket or stop with one of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just under seven minutes left, the Gauchos managed to stitch together another run — their first real spurt of the half. After UC Davis freshman guard Ezra Manjon knocked down 2 free throws to cut the lead to 54-50, UCSB worked the ball inside: big man Sow scored twice and Heidegger flipped in a layup to push the lead to double digits for the first time in the half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Les immediately called a timeout and, unlike his earlier timeout, this one managed to flip the momentum, at least for a little bit. Junior forward Kennedy Koehler scored 3 straight times  to bring his team back within 4 points of the lead, putting some serious pressure on the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB responded with overwhelming force. Heidegger struck back first with a deep 3 from straightaway, and it was all Gauchos from there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koehler’s last layup in his personal mini-run was UC Davis’ last point of the night, and it came with 4:18 left on the clock. The Aggies were wholly unable to get a bucket from that point on, while UCSB poured on 10 straight points to close out the 14-point win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the end of regulation wasn’t particularly exciting, with the Gauchos holding such a commanding lead, the postgame handshake line had plenty of drama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Les appeared to pass Pasternack without a handshake and then yelled back at the Gaucho head coach. As Les was yelling, Mooney ran up behind Heidegger and shoved the Gaucho guard in the back, setting off a shoving match at center court that took a while to finally clear up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack didn’t provide an explanation of what exactly happened, but he did have plenty of praise for Les.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not sure [what was going on],” Pasternack said. “I think Coach Les is one of the best coaches in the country. I think he is very, very hard to beat. His teams execute as well as any team I’ve ever coached against in my career.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger led all scorers with 17 points, but Sow wasn’t far behind with 16 of his own. The second-year big had 6 rebounds and 2 blocks and made his presence felt against an undersized UC Davis team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, it was a guard cleaning up the boards for UCSB, but this time it was Cyrus with a team-high 8 rebounds. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin, meanwhile, led the Gauchos with 7 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB is a Thursday matchup against UC Riverside, who is currently second-to-last in the Big West, and then a Saturday game at UC Irvine. The Anteaters sit comfortably atop the Big West at 11-2, but the Gauchos stole their crown the last time the two teams met with a 64-61 victory.</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience as a student at UC Santa Barbara was full of sweet excitement, stunning beauty, a rigorous education, lifelong friends, ridiculous fun and a feeling that my youth would never end. Of all of my experiences as a Gaucho, some of my most thrilling were when Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers came to UCSB in October of 1999 and deeply and visibly engaged the campus community into a magical wave of purple and gold euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was extremely exciting when the Lakers announced that they would return to UCSB for their training camp. They had been there the prior season, but I had been too engrossed in midterms to participate (they were there in February of 1999 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a strange time for NBA training camp </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to a strike-shortened season). This time, the Lakers would be on campus from early to mid-October, right after the school year started. Perfect! No need for much studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers conducted their practices at Rob Gym.  Being a lifelong, die-hard Lakers fan, I was determined to connect with the players, and I had the two necessary items that would help me accomplish this. The prior summer, I had bought a gold Shaq jersey, and I had also just purchased what remains my most prized possession </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Sector 9 longboard that I still skate with in 2020. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided that I was going to get as many Lakers as possible to sign my jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve this goal, I decided to use the skateboard to my advantage. I figured out that I could place my jersey on top of the longboard and hand the entire board to the players I wanted to sign my jersey.  That way, it took up a lot of space in their field of vision and it would be harder to refuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One afternoon during the training camp, I stood at the exit to Rob Gym where the players would pass as they got onto their bus. The players began exiting the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Shaq signed nothing as he passed, saying with pomp: “I’m not signing anything.” It’s all good. He wasn’t the one I wanted anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of other players signed autographs though. I handed my skateboard to five players who signed my jersey: Robert Horry, Tyronn Lue, Derek Fisher, Glen Rice and one Kobe Bryant. For the last 21 years, I’ve been skating on my board, loving that Kobe held it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes, all the Lakers got on the bus — except Kobe. Kobe kept signing and signing, with a smile. Finally, the bus with the players on it started honking at him! He just ignored the honking. He kept signing away outside of Rob Gym, again, with a smile on his face. He was doing what he wanted to do </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the fans happy </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regardless of his teammates’ wishes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Kobe got on the bus and the Lakers departed, my jaw dropped as I realized that I had hit the mother lode </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was standing there next to Rob Gym with a bright gold Lakers jersey with the signatures of five players, including one superstar.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92519\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"708944687\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92411\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92519\" data-attachment-id=\"92519\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/alum-recounts-how-kobe-brought-purple-gold-euphoria-to-ucsb/img_9134/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1152\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9134\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92519\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9134.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My time interacting with the Lakers was not through, however. At the end of camp, the Lakers held a free intrasquad scrimmage for the UCSB community at the Thunderdome.  In Phil Jackson’s book, “More Than a Game,” he discusses this public practice, stating “we were certainly well hosted in Santa Barbara.” Jackson also refers to UCSB as “one of the most beautiful college campuses in the country.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right outside the Thunderdome, the Lakers showed up in front of a handful of fans, and walked into the arena basically in a line. I asked Phil Jackson for an autograph (even calling him Mr. Jackson) but he told me that he had to start practice. Fair enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last player who passed? A certain Kobe Bean Bryant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I called to him. “Kobe!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He turned his head toward me: “Yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can I get my picture taken with you?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sure,” he said. He walked the 15 feet or so from the entrance of the building to where I was standing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me point out that this was in the pre-digital camera era. I didn’t even own a camera. Before I showed up to the T-Dome, I bought a disposable camera from the Isla Vista Market, just in case I got lucky, and as Kobe approached, I gave the camera to some random dude to take it, hoping that he wouldn’t blow my chance for a souvenir for the ages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe came up to me and wrapped his arm tightly around my shoulders, like I was his little brother. The disposable camera snapped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Thanks, man,” I said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re welcome,” said the future Hall-of-Famer, Olympic gold medalist and five-time NBA world champion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in absolute nirvana. I was flying above the ground. It was a total exhilaration. I was dizzy. Kobe had shown himself to be, without a doubt, the most accessible Laker, the kindest one and the most devoted to his fans. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92518\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"256188549\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92411\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92518\" data-attachment-id=\"92518\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/alum-recounts-how-kobe-brought-purple-gold-euphoria-to-ucsb/img_9057/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1894&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1894\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9057\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=250%2C231&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?fit=888%2C821&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92518\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=888%2C821\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"821\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=250%2C231&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=1024%2C947&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=768%2C710&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1421&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9057.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92518\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, the Lakers meandered their way into the room, unannounced. There was big applause for all of the players. Except there was one player missing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the youngest player on the team. When Kobe nonchalantly entered the arena, there was a cacophony of ear-splitting applause, a standing ovation for the ages, one that put the thunder in the Thunderdome. The deafening ovation was even bigger than the crowd had given for superstar Shaquille O’Neal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scrimmage itself was delicious. It was the purple team against the gold team. For pure fans, how wonderful is it to see players on one’s favorite team play one another? I wish I had more precise memories of the game, but I clearly was in the afterglow of my time with Kobe. I just remember being so happy. Feeling so lucky. To be at my beloved, beautiful university and to have the basketball team I had loved since I was 6 years old visit my campus and interact with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA Championship that season for the first time in 12 years. They clinched it exactly two days after I walked in my graduation ceremony on June 17, 2000. So two extremely meaningful and emotional life events for me happened within a week. The Lakers also won the championship the next year … and finished off the three-peat the following season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want everyone reading this to remember this: The three-peat all started in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spent half of my life watching Kobe dazzle and amaze. I always thought that he would be an ambassador for the Lakers and the NBA for the next 40 or 50 years. I am deeply sad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I remember this story, I feel immense gratitude and love </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for my magical and wonderful college experience at UCSB, for basketball, the Lakers and for Kobe Bryant. The experiences I’m recounting happened 20 years ago, but they feel like they went down yesterday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My memories as a Gaucho are sweet and exhilarating. In the midst of my sorrow about the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, my wonderful recollections from when Kobe and the Lakers came to campus are swirling in my mind. Thank you, Kobe, for being so kind and friendly to the fans, and, for the briefest of moments, making me feel like we were 21-year-old brothers.</span></p>\n<p><img id=\":qv\" class=\"aQG aYB\" src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2?ui=2&amp;ik=19b85fc9cf&amp;attid=0.4&amp;permmsgid=msg-f%3A1657105471226878025&amp;th=16ff38a577d59849&amp;view=fimg&amp;realattid=16ff3874f5b38d68f21&amp;disp=thd&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ9UVr26jcg0YfNr0DGxztKet3EPcb5Ul6HLTF7GzKxKm9nM9P2NMc4Jl_mq1wDMCIMa6P14rKi15muIXX7_dg_nA-l0_afgRfvVY_2SVcvOEvgo1SA44XpjWU0&amp;ats=2524608000000&amp;sz=w180-h120-df-p-nu\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Jonathan Neal graduated from UCSB in 2000 with majors in Business Economics and Political Science.

past week, falling to Long Beach State 53-59 on Thursday before beating Cal State Northridge 65-55 on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the split, the Gauchos (10-14, 5-6) moved into fourth place in the Big West conference, jumping over Cal State Northridge (CSUN) in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s practice, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the coaching staff emphasized the need to take care of the ball against the tenacious Long Beach State (LBSU) defense. While the 49ers are undersized, they pester opponents with their ¾ court press, forcing 21.3 turnovers per game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, however, turnovers would prove to be the Achilles’ heel for the ‘Chos — who turned the ball over 23 times on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have tremendous athletes on the ball and in the passing lanes,” Henrickson said about LBSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a low-scoring, defensive slugfest, those turnovers would prove to be the difference. LBSU scored 24 points off of turnovers, and scored 20 fastbreak points on the night. In comparison, UCSB did not score a single point in transition in the entire game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Gauchos hung around for most of the night — thanks in large part to the continued dominance of freshman forward-center Ila Lane. In one of her more efficient performances of the season, Lane finished the game with 18 points on 87.5% shooting, while also grabbing 12 rebounds for yet another double-double.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Lane, however, UCSB struggled to create offense for much of the night. Only one other player — senior guard Coco Miller — scored in double figures on the night for Santa Barbara, and she did so on 4-16 shooting from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of the night, the Gauchos’ offensive struggles were nothing but a minor inconvenience, especially with the ‘Chos’ defense thriving. After three quarters, UCSB had held LBSU to merely 36 points, with Long Beach turning the ball over 14 times in the first three quarters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fourth quarter, however, things fell apart for the team. Long Beach proceeded to score 23 points on 70% shooting; with UCSB’s offense still nowhere to be found, the Gauchos were unable to keep pace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard Shanaijah Davison and sophomore guard Justina King led the way for Long Beach on the night, with the duo finishing with 19 points and 17 points, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, however, UCSB used a 23-point fourth quarter of its own to knock off Cal State Northridge on the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into the matchup, all eyes were on the paint battle between Lane and redshirt senior De’Jionae Calloway — who entered the game averaging 14.3 points per game and 8.2 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 40 minutes of play, Lane emerged the clear winner from that individual battle, finishing the game with 16 points and 17 rebounds. Meanwhile, Calloway struggled for much of the night, finishing with only 4 points on 2-12 shooting for the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Tal Sahar also turned in one of her best performances of the season, chipping in 18 points off the bench for UCSB. In the fourth quarter in particular, Sahar left her stamp on the game, drilling three 3-pointers and shooting 75% from behind the arc in the quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Miller did an excellent job of facilitating the offense all night; while she struggled from the field, she finished the game with 8 assists to lead the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Matadors, second-year guard Jordyn Jackson was the high-scorer on the night with 16 points — the only CSUN player to score double figures on the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a logjam in the middle of the Big West standings, every game matters to the Gauchos from now on. This week, UCSB will return home to take on CSUN once again on Thursday before hosting UC Riverside on Saturday in a revenge game.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

With a logjam in the middle of the standings, UCSB will need to string together a win streak if it hopes to improve its seeding for the conference tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the Gauchos will host Cal State Northridge (CSUN) and UC Riverside (UCR) in two crucial matchups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, the ‘Chos will take on the Matadors on Thursday in a rematch of last Saturday’s game — a 65-55 road victory for Santa Barbara. That game was in large part dominated by freshman phenom Ila Lane, who finished the game with 16 points and 17 rebounds. On defense, Lane played a key role in shutting down CSUN’s leading scorer — senior De’Jionae Calloway, who finished the game with only 4 points on 2-12 shooting from the floor.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Tal Sahar also turned in one of her best performances of the season, chipping in 18 points off the bench for UCSB. In the fourth quarter in particular, Sahar left her stamp on the game, drilling three 3-pointers and shooting 75% from behind the arc in the quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Matadors were able to keep the game tight for much of the night. In particular, sophomore  guard Jordyn Jackson had an excellent night, finishing the game with 16 points on 6-9 shooting. In addition, despite a rough shooting night for CSUN’s starters, the team’s bench excelled all night, scoring 20 of the team’s 55 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB will have the home-court advantage this time around, don’t expect Calloway to shoot 17% from the floor this time around. The Matadors will also likely double and triple-team Lane in the post this go-around, meaning the Gauchos will need a significant contribution from their backcourt on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While senior Coco Miller didn’t shoot the ball particularly well on Saturday — finishing the game with 8 points on 3-13 shooting — her contributions extend far beyond her field-goal percentage. Currently, Miller ranks fourth in the country with a 3.1 assist-to-turnover ratio. Against the Matadors, Miller finished the game with 8 assists and only 2 turnovers and will need to continue that level of production and efficiency if the Gauchos are to walk away victorious on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, UCSB will take on UC Riverside (8-16, 4-6), looking to avenge their loss from earlier this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that game — a 66-61 victory for the Highlanders — Lane struggled mightily with foul trouble, only logging 26 minutes on the night. Without the focal point of their offense, the Gauchos struggled from the floor, shooting only 36% on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time around, UCSB will need to make a concerted effort to slow down UCR’s backcourt. In the previous matchup, junior guard Keilanei Cooper roasted the ‘Chos all night, finishing with 23 points on an efficient 8-13 shooting split.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, Santa Barbara needs to limit the production of redshirt senior Jannon Otto — who ranks second in the conference with 16.6 points per game. One of the best players in the entire conference, Otto can score from anywhere on the floor, shooting 36% from deep and 88% from the free-throw line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos can stay out of foul trouble and limit the production of UCR’s backcourt, they should have a good chance to finish the week with a crucial victory. Riverside has struggled mightily away from home this season, with only one of the team’s conference wins coming on the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will take on Cal State Northridge on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome, before finishing the week against UC Riverside on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
