Nearly all of her field goals in the game were from three-point distance except one jumpshot as she ended the game 6-15 from the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman emerged big in the second half. After no shot attempts in the first half due to two fouls limiting her to play for just four minutes, Edelman recorded all 12 of her field goal attempts in the game’s last 20 minutes. Her domination of the paint led to her finishing with 16 points on 8-12 shooting to go with five rebounds and one block. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was definitely exciting to not be in foul trouble anymore,” Edelman said. “My teammates are great about throwing me the ball. When they kick it in and I’m getting double teamed, I can kick it out and I know that Coco will knock down an open shot. It’s definitely a good thing we have going.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to penetrate the paint to open up shots on the perimeter worked out the gates as Miller drained a three to give UCSB its first points of the games. The deep make ignite the Gauchos’ 5-0 run to start the first quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the 7:01 mark of the period, Pepperdine had earned its first lead, responding with a 9-0 run of its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the Waves’ scoring charge were their guard tandem of redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro and senior Allie Green. Hitting her first three-pointer of the game during the run, Bordonaro scored five points to contribute to her team-high total of 15 points on 6-12 overall and 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green scored the other four during the scoring stretch, ending the game with 12 points on 4-11 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gained its first double-figure lead of 21-11 during its 10-0 run that carried over from the end of the first to the second period. It earned its largest lead of 14 points at 27-13 as a result of a made layup by redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB pressured the Waves’ offense into turning the ball over a total of 22 times, but was inefficient in capitalizing on its opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite shooting 6-16  from three-point range in the first two quarters, the Gauchos struggled inside the three-point line and had issues converting on their forced turnovers, going 3-18 on layups in the first half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you miss a wide open layup, you’re focused on the wrong thing,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “You’re wide open, you’ve got to finish. We missed nine [wide open layups]. We just absolutely didn’t reward our defense for opportunities in transition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inconsistencies in transition ultimately led to Santa Barbara’s being held scoreless in the remaining 5:47 of the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pepperdine embarked on a 9-0 run to end the first half, trimming the Gauchos’ lead to 27-22 at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tie of the game occurred at the 7:42 mark of the third quarter as Pepperdine’s Green had an open left lane to the basket, knotting the game at 29-29. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping improve the Gauchos’ 24.3 field goal percentage was their improvements in shot selection in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a balance to UCSB’s three-point attack was its emphasis on getting the ball to the paint in the second half. It attempted just eight three-point attempts, finishing the game 8-24 from downtown, and displayed its commitment to Edelman early. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan to feed Edelman in the paint was beneficial as she ended the third quarter with 10 points on 4-7 shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three-pointer by Porter just 30 seconds into the fourth quarter regained a double-figure lead for UCSB, building its lead to 45-34.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoring eight of her 12 total points in the fourth quarter of the game was Pepperdine’s sophomore forward Yasmine Robinson-Bacote. Able to convert on an and-1 opportunity Robinson-Bacote after a successful drive to the hoop, bringing the Waves’ deficit to 51-44.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steal followed by a go-ahead layup by sophomore guard Paige Fecske allowed the Waves to stay in contention, trailing 58-51, as they called a timeout after the field goal with 51 seconds remaining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of Pepperdine closing in on their lead, the Gauchos managed to secure their first victory at the free throw line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB kept its poise at the line, making 13-21 free throws in the fourth quarter alone as it ended 16-25. Miller and senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe led UCSB in its foul shooting, making a combined 13-18 from the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An arid pass out of bounds by Bordonaro followed by a turnover in Pepperdine’s final two possessions of the game allowed UCSB to milk the clock in the game’s remaining 12 seconds, finalizing UCSB’s 66-57 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to maintain their momentum on the road at Seattle University tonight at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/ucsb-earns-first-victory-in-home-opener/","id":312,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[311,310,309],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Travel To Seattle in Search of a Second Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-09-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"If the early offensive pattern for both Seattle University and UCSB holds true, spectators can expect to see a lot of three-pointers when the two teams meet in Seattle on Friday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to truly determine a trend from only a couple games.

They have one girl who’s taken 19 threes in two games and they’ve taken only eight free throws, which is really indicative of a lot of catch-and-shoot from three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of Seattle’s offensive production, including its production from three-point land, comes from just two players: senior wing Kaylee Best and senior wing Alexis Montgomery. Best, a 5’8” senior wing, is shooting over 47 percent from long range and is averaging a Western Athletic Conference-high 21.5 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just need to limit (Best’s) touches,” Hendrickson said. “We need to execute ball-side deny, we need to know their personnel and where she is on the floor, and we need to keep our hands up on defense. The main thing is just going to be keeping the ball out of her hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow Montgomery has started off on fire, shooting 50 percent from three and scoring 14.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopping Best and Montgomery, or at least keeping them relatively quiet, is UCSB’s best chance at forcing the Redhawk offense to a halt. Only one other Seattle player — senior guard Claire Metoyer — is averaging over five points per game. If the Gauchos can get the ball out of Best or Montgomery’s hands, they’ll have succeeded in getting the Redhawks out of their offensive comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their two regular-season games, plus their exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, the Gauchos have shown a definite affinity for the three, but Hendrickson isn’t planning on making that a focus on Friday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our advantage is inside, so we’ll focus on getting high percentage touches there,” Hendrickson said. “If we can do that consistently, the defense will collapse and we can kick it outside. If we can score a number of different ways it really puts pressure on the defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Redshirt junior Drew Edelman will be the key to success of Hendrickson’s game plan. The 6’4” center put up 16 points, all in the second half, to push the Gauchos past Pepperdine on Tuesday and will be the player point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and junior Drea Toler will look to funnel the ball down low to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Hendrickson’s vision come true, and the Gauchos succeed in forcing the Redhawk defense to collapse, there will be several beneficiaries among the UCSB offense. Sophomore wing Coco Miller went off for 24 points, including five threes, against Pepperdine, and, along with guards junior Makala Roper and sophomore Sarah Porter, will be eager for kick-outs from Edelman and the other Gaucho bigs.</span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on Seattle University at 7 p.m. on Friday, November 18 at KeyArena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Now that their top dogs are gone, it is their chance to show the team just what kind of players they are.</p>\n<p>As a freshman last year, Renfro shot 51.2 percent and had 19 blocks on the year, proving his capability as a starter. Against Illinois-Chicago, he scored 12 points over 27 minutes along with three assists.</p>\n<p>Foster came away with eight points, shooting 4-9 against the Flames. During the 2015-16 season, the Colorado native made 27 three-pointers and played in all 30 games.</p>\n<p>Senior Ronnie Boyce shone brightly as a leader against the Illinois-Chicago, scoring 28 points in 26 minutes of playing time, 13 points more than any other player on the court. Boyce, a guard originally from Oklahoma, will definitely be a player to watch.</p>\n<p>Transferring to USF as a junior in 2015, he earned his position as third-leading scorer on the team, including a career-high 25 point performance away with a career high of 25 points, a personal record he has already beat in just the first game of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>In last year’s UCSB-USF game, Boyce played only two minutes. Judging by his performance last week, the Gauchos will most likely be seeing plenty of him.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced-off, UCSB may have won, but the Dons fought it to the end, scoring six points in the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>Having just lost at home, the Gauchos will be looking to turn around that 0-1 record at the Thunderdome on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74256\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74256\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/ucsb-aims-to-capture-first-win-of-the-season/","id":310,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[309,308,307],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set to Host Pepperdine in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-14-at-9.34.48-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-14-at-9.34.48-PM.png?resize=662%2C435&ssl=1","description":"Entering its Tuesday home opener with an 0-1 record, the UCSB women's basketball team will attempt to overcome the losing start in its return to the T-Dome to host Pepperdine.

They drive it, they can create shots for themselves and screen well. Coming off our last game, we have to be able to defend 1-on-1 [[one-on-one]] better, work on keeping someone in front of us.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are looking to get on a winning track after season-opening losses, leaving them 0-1 entering Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s meeting against the Waves resulting in a close loss, the meeting marked the breakout of junior guard Makala Roper after a career-high 27 points in the loss. The performance led to Roper being moved from the bench to the starting lineup for the remainder of the 2015-16 season after having just six her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Finishing with 25 starts, Roper capitalized in her starting role. She led the Gauchos in scoring with 11.8 points per game and ended with a team-high six 20-plus point performances, four of which occurred after her career game against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Roper will hope to have more of an impact on Tuesday after just eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field and a 2-4 showing from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Preventing Roper from getting into a shooting rhythm were her issues handling the ball as she finished the game with a game-high five turnovers. The Gauchos’ sharpshooter will look to overcome her miscues early in the season after ranking second in the Big West with an average of 4.0 turnovers per game the previous year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what ‘Rope’ does is a byproduct of the efforts of Onome and other players to drive and kick to her,” said Henrickson. “She does a good job of using screens and setting her feet. There are times when we want her to put the ball on the floor and drive it, [which is] an opportunity to manufacture some offense at the free-throw line. [Tuesday] will be a great opportunity for her to get back on track and be the player we all think she can be.”</p>\n<p>The issue with turnovers has plagued UCSB’s entire unit as its lax ball control resulted in it turning the ball over 24 times on Friday. The Gauchos were outscored 26-17 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was really just poor decisions. We tried to make plays that weren’t there,” said Henrickson. “We didn’t take what the defense gives us as opposed to [issues with] weak side help or we don’t seal inside. It’s never a one-player mistake. The guards have to do a better job; the bigs have to do a better job.”</p>\n<p>The inefficiencies when possessing the ball are reminiscent of last season’s start in which Santa Barbara ended leading the Big West with 18.5 turnovers per game. In 2015-16, it amassed 20-plus turnovers in 14 games, going 4-10.</p>\n<p>In addition to turnovers, the season opener highlighted how vulnerable the Gauchos are in the paint. They were at a disadvantage against the Cyclones, being outscored 46-20.</p>\n<p>“We did a poor job of recognizing weak side defense and at times we didn’t give the effort you need to be able to get a touch one-on-one inside,” Henrickson explained.</p>\n<p>Although a concern, the team is still conforming to the depth added to its frontcourt this offseason as it has made redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman the starter in her first year with the program. In 25 minutes of play, Edelman tallied six points on 3-6 shooting, a tied team-high six rebounds, and one block.</p>\n<p>There will be little room for error Tuesday night against Pepperdine, as even in their season opening loss against Long Beach State they held the 49ers to 44 points.</p>\n<p>Despite the defeat, the Waves managed to contain the 49ers to dismal shooting percentages of 20.9 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine boasts a young roster that possesses just one senior within its total of six players returning from last year. It lost its best player, guard Erica Ogwumike, this offseason as the team’s leading scorer transferred to Rice University after averaging the fifth most points by a freshman in the nation with 18.4 PPG.</p>\n<p>An all-around talent, Ogwumike led the Waves in rebounds and steals per game at 7.5 and 1.9 per contest, respectively. She scored 22 points in the Waves’ win over the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>However, the loss has opened opportunities for other players that could potentially fill the Waves’ void.</p>\n<p>Returning from an injury last season and leading Pepperdine in scoring in its season opener was redshirt freshman Sydney Bordonaro. She finished with a game-high 12 points, going 4-10 from the field. Bordonaro’s 3-5 finish from behind the three-point line carried the Waves’ 40 percent shooting from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As the lone senior on the team, guard Allie Green topped Ogwumike’s points in the first meeting. She went off for team-high 24 points on 9-15 shooting and was 1-1 from behind the three-pointer. She will look to clean up her shooting after a 4-16 outing from the field and 11 points in the team’s opener.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Pepperdine will tip-off at 7 p.m. this Tuesday, Nov. 15 in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74179\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74179\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-set-to-host-pepperdine-in-home-opener/","id":311,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[310,309,308],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
