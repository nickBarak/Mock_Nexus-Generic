Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Over the holiday weekend, the UCSB basketball team had little to be thankful for; as the UCSB women’s basketball team lost both of its games in the Saint Mary’s Tournament. On Friday, the Gauchos lost by 30 points to Saint Mary’s 89-59. Then on Saturday, they fell to the University of Alabama at Birmingham 67-54.</p>\n<p>With these two recent losses, Santa Barbara now sits at 1-4 and is in the midst of a four-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse at home against Seattle, the Gauchos had a week to prepare for the tournament in Moraga, California. Yet, Santa Barbara was outmatched by the host team in the opener as the Gaels of Saint Mary’s handed Santa Barbara its third consecutive loss, which was then followed by a defeat to UAB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SAINT MARY’S Game</strong></p>\n<p>The afternoon game began with UCSB getting the ball stolen, allowing the Gaels to get on the board first 2-0. Overall, Saint Mary’s forced 16 total turnovers and converted those into 25 points. Including the opening steal, Saint Mary’s guard Stella Beck tallied 6 steals on the day. The senior also racked up 18 points off 6-9 shooting and recorded her 1000th career point against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held their only lead of the game after a Sarah Bates layup and a single Drew Edelman free throw made it 3-2 with 8:23 left in the first quarter. Edelman, a 6’4 redshirt senior, had another frustrating game, getting in foul trouble early and battling talented Saint Mary’s post players.</p>\n<p>Despite picking up two fouls in the first four minutes, Edelman contributed 10 points and a team-high 7 boards for the Gauchos. Saint Mary’s found much of their success down low, outscoring UCSB 52-16 in the paint and out-rebounding the Gauchos 42-32.</p>\n<p>A slow start for Santa Barbara forced head coach Bonnie Henrickson to take a 30-second timeout at the 4:52 mark. Out of the timeout, the Gaels went on to extend their 11-5 lead to 16-5. Santa Barbara finally got rolling thanks to sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Hernandez scored all of her 13 points in the first half, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Gaels, led by Sydney Raggio. The junior forward had 19 points and 9 rebounds, both game highs, and shot an efficient 8-13 from the field.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with the Gauchos making a bit of a run and the chance to cut the Gael lead to 3, but Chaya Durr’s layup attempt was blocked with just one second remaining. Saint Mary’s led after 10 minutes of play 22-17.</p>\n<p>After the somewhat hopeful end of the first quarter for UCSB, the Gauchos went on to shoot only 23.1 percent from the field in the second quarter. Saint Mary’s used big plays from Raggio and Beck to outscore the Gauchos 21-14 in the quarter.</p>\n<p>At the 6:25 mark, center Natalia Bruening made a pair of free throws to put Santa Barbara within 4, down only 25-29. But, the Gaels proceeded to go on a 10-0 run to lead the Gauchos 39-25 with 3:26 remaining. UCSB used a pair of threes from Sarah Bates and Tal Sahar to end their scoring drought, but the Gauchos remained behind 43-31 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>The third quarter of play saw UCSB’s struggles continue, turning the ball over 5 times and only scoring 16 points while allowing 26. Edelman scored 8 of her 10 in the quarter, but Akilah Jennings and Danae Miller were the only other Gauchos to score, each contributing 4 points. Saint Mary’s extended their lead using an array of scoring to go up 69-47 heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Down by 22, a Santa Barbara comeback seemed unlikely. The Gaels’ reserves held UCSB to only 12 points in the final quarter and an abysmal 16.7 percent shooting. At the final buzzer, UCSB was defeated by Saint Mary’s 89-59. The 30-point margin is Santa Barbara’s largest deficit of the season.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB shot 30.5 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from three. The Gaels, on the other hand, shot above an impressive 50 percent in both categories. With the win against the Gauchos and then a fourth straight win recorded against Indiana, the Gaels won their own tournament and sit at 4-1 overall.</p>\n<p><strong>UAB Game</strong></p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, they had a chance to turn around the next day and compete. Facing the University of Alabama at Birmingham on Saturday, Santa Barbara looked to bring a bit more energy to the court.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game with a three-ball from junior guard Akilah Jennings, one of her four threes in the game. Jennings, in her first season at UCSB, scored a team-high 14 points and shot 4-8 from three-point range. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, Jennings was the only Gaucho to score in double figures versus the Blazers.</p>\n<p>Using a pair of threes from Aliceah Hernandez in addition to a three from Nina Radford, Santa Barbara spread the floor early. UAB was held to 4-17 shooting in the quarter, with big buckets coming from junior Deanna Kuzmanic, who scored 5 of her game-high 24 points in the first. At the end of the first, the Gauchos led the Blazers 16-10, holding UAB scoreless in the final 4:53.</p>\n<p>Although the Blazers got off to a rough start, they bounced back in the second quarter. Following a UCSB three-pointer by Danae Miller, the Blazers fired back with a 24-9 run to end the half. Kuzmanic and fellow Blazer Miyah Barnes were instrumental in the UAB run, with the sophomore Barnes scoring 8 of her 17 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Fellow Blazer Angela Vendrell got in on the fun as well, scoring 6 points in the quarter. Vendrell, a sophomore from Spain, ended the game with 8 points and a game-high 12 boards. The huge quarter for UAB put the Blazers up 34-28 at the end of the half.</p>\n<p>Down six at the start of the second half, UCSB used a 20-point third quarter in able to tie the Blazers at 48 heading into the fourth. A pair of free throws from Radford and two more threes by Jennings to open the quarter tied the game at 36 with 6:41 to go.</p>\n<p>Jennings scored 8 points in the quarter and Santa Barbara post-players Edelman and Bruening added four points each. From there, UAB and Santa Barbara traded baskets on efficient shooting. Each team shot above 50 percent in the third to set the stage for a decisive final quarter.</p>\n<p>The final 10 minutes began with the Blazers going on a 13-0 run. A close game just minutes before, UCSB found itself down 48-61 with 5:52 left in the game. Out of gas, the Gauchos couldn’t rally a comeback.  On 20 percent overall and 12.5 percent from three-point range, the Gauchos managed to only score 6 points in the final quarter. Sarah Porter ended the drought with a layup and-one to make it 51-61 at the 5:30 mark. The only other scoring for UCSB came from an Akilah Jennings three with just 56 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Blazers dominated the fourth quarter to come away with the 67-54 win. Kuzmanic outscored the Gauchos herself in the fourth, scoring 9 of her 24 in the final quarter. UCSB’s persistent turnover issue remained, as the Gauchos turned the ball over 15 times.</p>\n<p>With the win, UAB moves to 4-1 overall while handing the Gauchos their fourth straight loss and first winless tournament since the 1992-93 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-27/womens-basketball-doesnt-fare-well-at-the-saint-marys-tournament-lost-4th-consecutive-game/","id":675,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[674,673,672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift","biography":"Not available","articles":[32,33,42,202,203,206,218,221,598,603,655,675,681,691,696,747,770,781,819,837,838,846,865,898,938,944,945,946,950,969,997,1209,1212,1213,1214,1330,1836,1849,1871,4876,4887,4890,4908,4909,4910,4911,4912,4913,4914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Lock Down Subregional Title With Win Over Montana; Will Host Prairie View Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to extend its winning streak to three after defeating Montana earlier in the week.

Four different players scored in the first five minutes for the Gauchos, and they quickly ran up a double digit lead. Their offense to start seemed like a testament to the heavy focus on ball movement that Coach Pasternack brought to the team as they consistently passed up good shots for great ones, something they hadn’t been doing in their prior losses.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The engine for the Gauchos offense was definitely Leland King II in the first half. The forward had his third 20 point game of the year, and is playing some of the best basketball of his career right now. He had ten points and four rebounds in the half, and was hounding the Grizzlies on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game showcased how much value he has just by his ability to stretch the floor. The graduate transfer went 2-4 from behind the arc, and while the amount might not sound that impressive, his accuracy from three forces defenders to respect his shot and creates huge lanes for the Gauchos to take advantage of. He finished with 20 points on 6-9 shooting, but he brings so much more to the offensive end than box score stats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other graduate transfer, Marcus Jackson, showed his versatility on the offensive end in his second game back from a hip injury. His playmaking ability was on full display in the first half, as he led the team in assists. The guard had a couple key sequences in the first half that helped push the lead up for the Gauchos, including a big block which led to a bucket by Max Heidegger that put them up by 18 with ten minutes left in the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB took an 11 point lead into halftime, but were quickly blindsided by a Grizzly run led by forward Jamar Akoh. The transfer from Cal State Fullerton revived Montana, getting a jump-shot and steal within the first two minutes, starting a wave of momentum that would end with them actually taking the lead about halfway in. He scored all of his 12 points in the second half, and would have been a hero had the Gauchos not had an offensive igniter of their own in Max Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a semi-quiet first half by the sophomore guard’s high standards (he “only” scored 8 points), Heidegger exploded for 18 points in the second. He went 4-6 from deep and made 10 field goals in just the second half alone, more than any other player made in the entire game. Heidegger closed out the game with 8 straight points, putting it out of reach for Montana and securing the win for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, UCSB returns to the Thunderdome on Friday to take on Prairie View A&amp;M (1-3). The Panthers come into this matchup fresh off their first victory over Eastern Kentucky, but have lost by double digits in their other three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are going to have to keep an eye on forward Zachary Hamilton, who’s averaging near 18 points and 4 rebounds a game this year. It will be another challenge for Jalen Canty and King II down low, although they have responded great to almost any player thrown their way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focusing on the fundamentals is going to be essential for the Gauchos in this matchup, which they did a great job of in the last game against Montana. If they maintain the high free throw shooting percentage they had against the Grizzlies (80%), and limit turnovers, it should be a triumphant return home for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Prairie View tip off at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 24.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Taylor hit his first two three-pointers and sophomore center Alan Williams added six quick points to give UCSB a 12-0 lead to start the game. That run was put in danger, however, when Williams sprained his right ankle midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>“We stick in there with each other,” Taylor said. “We were going to get that win no matter what tonight. We had to stick together and stay strong and compete, and we did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB responded without its best player, turning a four-point advantage at the point of Big Al’s departure into a 37-29 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Big Al recorded 10 points and seven rebounds in a mere eight minutes on the night, providing UCSB with solid play in the first half. Williams missed three games due to a hamstring injury and was playing in only his third game back on Saturday before suffering another injury.</p>\n<p>“I thought we started this game with pretty good fight,” Coach Williams said. “I’m disappointed to see [Big Al] go out. I think he was going to have a big game, he looked very active.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing without Big Al, Santa Barbara continued to show its resilient energy in the second half. The Gauchos are down to eight players now without Williams and an assortment of other injured Gauchos.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson led the Gauchos in scoring with 13 points apiece. Brown pulled down a team-high eight rebounds, while Bryson grabbed six boards on the night.</p>\n<p>“We played more as a team tonight,” Brown said. “We got some good vibes going and some positive energy and that’s really what we need right now. We just started off hot right away. It was a good feeling. We just kept pushing the whole night.”</p>\n<p>The story of the night for the Gauchos was their hot shooting, as they shot 50 percent on both field goals and three-pointers. Junior guard Kyle Boswell scored nine points on the night while finishing 3-3 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“We hit some shots, we played with a great sense of urgency, we had some good energy; I thought they pulled for each other pretty hard tonight,” Coach Williams said. “That’s something as a young group, sometimes you just start playing instead of playing with a purpose. I thought we had a little better purpose [tonight].”</p>\n<p>Taylor provided the Gauchos with solid play at the point on the night, registering a career-high tying 11 points along with eight assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Ross Rivera led Pacific with 15 points on the night and was one of only two Tigers to register double-digit scoring along with senior guard Lorenzo McCloud who had 10 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s big, we needed a win. It’s been awhile obviously since we got a win,” Brown said. “We needed to get back on track so it was a good game for us and we’ve just got to keep pushing it and go get Cal Poly now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face rival Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/","id":673,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[672,671,670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels East For Yale Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Another doubleheader invitational for women's volleyball ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58755\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.23.2014-01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"602829603\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64634\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58755\" data-attachment-id=\"58755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/gauchos-edged-by-hawaii-on-senior-night/w-volleyball-hawaii-def-ucsb-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.23.2014-01.jpg?fit=1600%2C1036&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1036\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Freshman outside hitter Chanel Hoffman digs out the ball while teammate Jaylen Villanueva looks on during UCSB's five set loss to the Rainbow Wahine on Friday night.

It’s another busy weekend for the Gauchos as they will face Rice on Friday and are set for a Saturday doubleheader against Yale and Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Following its performance in Malibu, Santa Barbara hopes for another fast-paced start after consecutive sweeps versus Utah Valley State and Incarnate Word. UCSB enters the Yale Invitational with an overall record of 2-1.</p>\n<p>Heading into New Haven is a hot Owls team that is looking to maintain its three-game winning streak. Currently holding a 3-1 overall record, it has been Rice’s ability to prevail when trailing early in matches that has allowed it to secure games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite losing the first set in two of their last three matches, the Owls have gone on to win. Leading Rice’s comeback successes is the remarkable play of junior outside hitter Leah Mikesky.</p>\n<p>The Owls’ team MVP last season, Mikesky had a total of 407 kills in 2014. She seems to be on the same track as she leads Rice in kills with 59 and ranks third on the team in digs with 39. Mikesky’s ability to produce on both sides of the net has been vital as she is coming off a match-high 17 kills and has a team-high of three double-doubles this season.</p>\n<p>Helping Mikesky shine on the court is the complimenting play of sophomore setter Madison McDaniel. McDaniel has been an absolute stud during Rice’s hot streak, recording 50-plus assists in each of the team’s last three games. Her total of 174 assists this season ranks third in the Conference USA as she averages 10.88 assists per set.</p>\n<p>With potential to produce similar statistics, freshman Annie Hasselmann could be the Gauchos’ next household name at the setter position. Through three games Hasselmann has 53 assists, just three behind redshirt senior Hanna Nielson’s team-high of 56. After an exceptional college debut, Hasselmann believes no limits exist for UCSB and its capabilities this season.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this team has really good potential,” Hasselmann said. “We have that fight. We have really good competitors, and I think that we can take down some tough teams this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara begins its Saturday doubleheader with a morning matchup against Yale. The Gauchos prepare to face the Ivy League’s best team of the past half-decade.  Dating back to 2010, the Bulldogs are five-time Ivy League champions.</p>\n<p>Yet to play a game this season, the reigning conference champions finished 2014 with an overall record of 18-8. Despite dominating the Ivy League, the Bulldogs didn’t have much success in the postseason as they were swept by Arizona in the first round of last year’s NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara managed to control the tempo in last week’s wins, its loss against Pepperdine displayed the team’s need to be more efficient after 10 errors in the third set.</p>\n<p>“The big thing is we just have to play cleaner volleyball,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said. “I am most looking forward to seeing them get better every match, every game, every point, and just learn from the past play and apply it to the next play. That’s a lot of the early season volleyball, the quick adjustments you can make, and that can help lead to a lot of success.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ends its visit to the East with a match against Rhode Island. The Rams come into the Yale Invitational with a 2-1 overall record and are on a two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Emerging as Rhode Island’s star player over the past three years, senior outside hitter Franki Darnold is on track for another stellar season. She is just 36 kills away from a total of 1,000 career kills, which would make her the ninth player in Rhode Island history to achieve the benchmark. Darnold ranks second in the Atlantic 10 conference in kills per set at 4.10.</p>\n<p>For senior captain outside hitter Ali Barbeau, in order for UCSB to be successful this weekend, it’s the little things in addition to the team’s performance that matters most.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked a lot on communication,” Barbeau said. “Making sure we’re aggressive and really sure about who has what role. We’re really working on more energy, more communication, and staying aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opens the Yale Invitational versus Rice at 2 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4<sup>th</sup> and will end the tournament on Saturday, Sept. 5<sup>th</sup>  with matches against Yale at 10 a.m. and Rhode Island at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-03/ucsb-travels-east-for-yale-invitational/","id":674,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[673,672,671],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
