Morton said Gelb may have been the victim, witness, involved in the incident or the suspect in the four other investigations.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office (SBSO), Gelb has never been arrested by SBSO.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Rob Romero from the UC Police Department said UCPD has not received any formal complaints about Gelb.</p>\n<p>Lt. Ruben Cintron, spokesperson for the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), also said no formal complaints have been filed against Gelb.</p>\n<p>SBPD is currently investigating Gelb on charges of disturbing the peace after he was filmed yelling homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>The <i>Nexus</i> contacted nine rental companies and two independent landlords for comment on Gelb and Del Playa Rentals’ business practices and their working relationships with him.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. A friend of Bertrand’s filmed the incident.</p>\n<p>In the video, Bertrand confronted Gelb about the landlord’s decision to sell all of his 37 properties in I.V. and said he did not treat his tenants well.</p>\n<p>Gelb became upset and began to follow Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting homophobic slurs at Bertrand, who is openly gay.</p>\n<p>Morton said the incident on Tuesday was the police department’s fifth contact with Gelb for anything other than traffic violations or parking tickets.</p>\n<p>While this incident prompted the police’s first investigation of Gelb, I.V. residents have complained about Gelb and Del Playa Rentals for years.</p>\n<p>Ellis Dane Andersen, a former UC Santa Barbara student, said while he lived at one of Gelb’s residences, he often heard Gelb say homophobic and racist slurs to his friends and housemates.</p>\n<p>One day, Andersen said, Gelb began yelling homophobic slurs at Andersen’s friend, who was openly gay. The neighbors called the police due to the disturbance, Andersen said.</p>\n<p>Andersen said law enforcement did not take statements from the residents.</p>\n<p>Lt. Cintron could not comment on this event, but said in an email that IVFP has responded to calls that “do not rise to the level of a crime and could be considered a civil matter or an incident.”</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the Legal Resource Center in I.V., said she has received “consistent complaints” about Del Playa Rentals from tenants over the past 14 years of working at the Legal Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Unander said she has addressed complaints about issues including security deposits, maintenance problems at a residence and transfer of leases. She said tenants do not directly complain about Gelb’s treatment of students in the majority of complaints.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes they come in with concerns specifically about him and how he engages his tenants and how he interacts with them, but rarely do they come in complaining just about that,” Unander said. “Usually there’s something else going on.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) has been notified of complaints about Gelb and privacy concerns, as well as complaints about Gelb’s behavior towards students, by the Legal Resource Center, according to Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and fourth-year political science and communication double major.</p>\n<p>Anderson lived at a Del Playa Rentals residence from 2013 to 2014. He said while living at the residence, Gelb would oftentimes walk into the house without warning.</p>\n<p>“He had a key for our house and he would just break in and inspect,” Andersen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79643\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79643\" data-attachment-id=\"79643\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/gelbattack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=1665%2C889&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1665,889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gelb picture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=888%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79643\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack-1024x547.jpg?resize=888%2C474\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=768%2C410&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?w=1665&amp;ssl=1 1665w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals in I.V., began yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Ethan Bertrand, president of the I.V. Community Services District at around 8 p.m. on a sidewalk on State Street.</em></p></div>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU has received privacy complaints about other landlords as well, not only Gelb. He said the union has prioritized making tenants more aware of their right to privacy so landlords cannot abuse their power.</p>\n<p>IVTU will host a town hall next Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero del Mar to discuss how tenants and landlords can settle disputes.</p>\n<p>Many tenants have questioned why Gelb’s behavior has persisted for so long, but Unander said Gelb’s actions have not violated housing practices.</p>\n<p>“When he makes decisions about who he’s going to rent to, so far he hasn’t engaged in any discriminatory conduct,” Unander said. “He hasn’t refused to rent to people who are part of a protected class. He rents to everybody.”</p>\n<p>The protected class is a group of people with common characteristics that are legally protected from discrimination under U.S. law, including race, gender, age and citizenship.</p>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU does not have a working relationship with Gelb, and said Gelb does not attend the Community Housing Office’s quarterly meetings.</p>\n<p>About 75 to 100 I.V. landlords and property owners attend the meeting, Renteria said.</p>\n<p>“Gelb just never goes to those meetings,” he said. “I think that if given the opportunity, if he were to play an active role in the community with all these other property providers and other landlords, that could create a relationship.”</p>\n<p>According to Jenn Birchim, the Community Housing Office’s program manager, the Community Housing Office has worked with Janette McWeeney, Del Playa Rentals property manager, but never directly with Gelb.</p>\n<p>“It’s better to have a relationship with somebody than nobody,” Birchim said.</p>\n<p>Birchim said McWeeney worked with the university in January, when a bluff collapsed at 6653 Del Playa Drive, one of Gelb’s properties. The collapse left 28 residents without secure housing.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, a graduate student and general manager of the I.V. Community Services District, lived at one of Gelb’s properties on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive during the 2013 to 2014 school year.</p>\n<p>“It was extremely negative dealing with James Gelb, and his staff who were all extremely unpleasant people,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he was the main point of contact in communicating with Gelb while living at the residence. He said the texts he received from Gelb were always “abrasive and unnecessarily aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite their negative experiences, both Andersen and Abboud said they never contacted the IVTU, Legal Resource Center or the police about Gelb’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“We figured if we wanted to live on Del Playa, we had to deal with Gelb,” Andersen said. “It’s not surprising to anyone, everyone just expects it out of him.”</p>\n<p>“It seemed futile to deal with Gelb,” Abboud added. “Gelb has a strong monopoly and has no reason to change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Office of Student Life (OSL), Campus Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety have clarified the requirements necessary for off-campus vendors like Camacho to sell on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>Camacho is currently working to obtain the necessary insurance and permits to work on campus again.</p>\n<p>Once UCSB approves Camacho’s current food permit and an insurance policy, he can sell with campus organizations once a month.</p>\n<p>“The next time we could see Mr. Camacho selling on campus is after he submits his certificate of insurance and is listed on the Approved Caterers list,” Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, said.</p>\n<p>According to Ashlock, the insurance policy can be obtained “in a matter of days, not weeks.”</p>\n<p>OSL’s requirements outline the steps for vendors to become fully certified to sell on campus, including a prerequisite that vendors have the necessary permits and insurance prior to selling.</p>\n<p>The university prohibited Camacho from selling on campus at the beginning of Fall Quarter because he did not have the correct permits and insurance, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">reported</a> in October.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Oct. 17 to discuss the new process of selling with on campus organizations.</p>\n<p>University vendors must first contact Campus Concessions for permission to sell on campus, according to OSL. Campus Concessions will then grant permission to sell if the vendor is on the university’s approved caterers list.</p>\n<p>Vendors on the approved caterers list must have general liability insurance that covers up to $2 million in liability and include the Regents of the University of California in the coverage.</p>\n<p>The university also requires that vendors have a Mobile Food Facility (MFF) permit or a general Santa Barbara County permit. The MFF permits range from $130 to $200 depending on the type of food sold and allows for vendors to sell on campus once a week.</p>\n<p>After the vendor is approved to sell on campus, they must fill out the Food Permit Application with Campus Concessions and awaits further approval from OSL and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<p>According to OSL’s regulations, vendors with a non-MFF food permit and an insurance that meets UCSB’s requirements will be allowed to sell only once a month. A vendor with insurance and a MFF type food permit will be able to sell once a week.</p>\n<p>Qualifying vendors may only sell at the SRB and only one off-campus vendor is allowed to sell per day.</p>\n<p>OSL met with representatives from student organizations on Oct. 20 to clarify the requirements and process of using off-campus vendors for fundraisers.</p>\n<p>The current off-campus vendors list has 26 approved vendors, including Silvergreens and Woodstock’s Pizza, and 29 vendors that are not approved to sell on campus. Camacho is not currently on the approved caterers list or the non-approved vendors list.</p>\n<p>Once the university approves a vendor for on-campus sales, the vendor will receive four complementary food permits from Campus Concessions. All permit after the fourth will cost $50 and each permit is valid for one day.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year, students noticed Camacho’s absence and questioned why he was no longer selling at the SRB.</p>\n<p>Jorge Santos, an Associated Students on-campus senator, said he contacted OSL to learn more about Camacho’s situation. Santos addressed the issues surrounding Camacho’s permission to sell on campus in a Facebook post on Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>“The Office of Student Life not only reached out to [Camacho] but have worked and are doing the most they can to get him back on campus as soon as possible.” Santos’ post read.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily

Currently, internet service providers like Verizon and AT&amp;T can’t charge websites to deliver content faster than other websites.</p>\n<p>The FCC now plans to vote on a repeal of network neutrality on Dec. 14, which would allow internet service providers to potentially serve users with extra charges and block, slow or speed up access to specific websites.</p>\n<p>Dylan Bolf, UC Santa Barbara Residential Computer Network (ResNet) technician, said that because UCSB purchases its bandwidth in bulk from a Tier 1 network, it was treated “neutrally” before the 2015 regulations were in place.</p>\n<p>A Tier 1 network is the overarching “backbone” of the internet, according to Bolf. By purchasing from a Tier 1 network, the university acts as a service provider for students.</p>\n<p>Regular consumers buy internet from Tier 3, which includes internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Cox, and would be subject to the new rules.</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, a software engineer and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District, explained that service providers like Comcast may want to repeal net neutrality to reduce risk and manage costs.</p>\n<p>Because customers demand unlimited internet plans to handle all their needs, Freeman said service companies must anticipate internet usage and predict how it might spike or fluctuate in the future.</p>\n<p>“They have essentially forced internet service providers in this horrible position of being insurance companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Their response to this is ‘we want the ability to charge somebody for the increase in bandwidth use by Netflix, whether it be Netflix or whether it be the user watching Netflix’… That is an argument that I can appreciate,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“It is still an argument that I find scary because I’ve seen absolute power corrupt absolutely,” he said.</p>\n<p>If the repeal goes through, the FCC would essentially restore “the internet to the state that it was two years ago,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Before Obama-era rules were implemented, residential users were the target of “extra charges and other net neutrality violating ideas,” Bolf said.</p>\n<p>For example, AT&amp;T blocked Apple’s FaceTime app from its data plan in 2012. If customers wanted to use the FaceTime app outside of Wi-Fi, they had to pay extra for an unlimited plan.</p>\n<p>Open internet advocacy groups claimed this was a violation of net neutrality, and AT&amp;T backed down before the groups filed an official complaint with the FCC.</p>\n<p>“We hope that we will be treated neutrally again if these rules are repealed, and would not violate the principles of net neutrality ourselves,” Bolf said in an email, explaining that UCSB would not manipulate the speed of any website.</p>\n<p>He added that ResNet “stands unanimously” behind the current net neutrality rules and hopes they remain in place.</p>\n<p>However, if the FCC does moves forward with the repeal, Bolf said ResNet would make sure the “students and residents are not impacted in any way that we can.”</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, UCSB’s associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said a cable company could artificially limit bandwidth to make certain services more appealing.</p>\n<p>“Imagine if AT&amp;T is the exclusive partner of Spotify and you can’t get Pandora on AT&amp;T without it hitting your bandwidth cap,” Hall said in an email.</p>\n<p>There will be an economic, innovational and choice impact to consumers in residential areas, Hall said, but “life on our UC campuses continues unchanged in the short term.”</p>\n<p>State senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents all of Santa Barbara County and western Ventura County, opposed the repeal saying it would set a “very dangerous precedent.”</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing is that [the repeal] will allow money interests to control content, to control access, to ultimately control thought,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said large, wealthy institutions like universities would be able to afford higher-quality internet, while a student startup wouldn’t be able to compete with large businesses.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure the internet is a fair and even playing field for all and continue to bridge our country’s existing digital divide,” he said. “That disparity will only grow if we do not act to protect net neutrality rules.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Dec. 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Tenants brought their issues with renting in I.V. to the I.V. Tenants Union’s town hall. Will Tran / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, chair of the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and a fourth-year political science and communications double major, led the town hall in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic building. The majority of the students present were Associated Students (A.S.) senators who spoke of their own issues with I.V. landlords.</p>\n<p>Several tenants expressed frustration about communicating with their landlords, citing incidents where their landlords had not responded to repeated emails or texts.</p>\n<p>Ron Perry, A.S. Legal Resource Center Staff Attorney, said that physical correspondence like “snail mail” is still the best way to communicate with landlords in the event of an issue, because some judges “still have a hard time with electronic communication” in court.</p>\n<p>He added that students should “always document” any communication that happens between themselves and their landlords.</p>\n<p>Anthony Pimentel, an A.S. off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said he has had disputes with his landlord in the past over getting his full security deposit back.</p>\n<p>“We’re only expecting a few hundred at worst to be deducted from our security deposit for average wear and tears,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said he was charged “outrageous prices” for carpet replacement, as well as for appliances and paint jobs throughout the house that had already been worn down before they moved in. He said he photographed these before moving in.</p>\n<p>Perry encouraged students to check landlords’ previous court disputes before signing a housing contract and to take pictures of the condition of the house before moving in like Pimentel had done.</p>\n<p>“We see the same landlords over and over and over again,” Perry said. “There’s a record of that, of course, you can go to the court or go online.”</p>\n<p>Renteria said that issues between tenants and landlords arise when students rent from “a few large corporations and multi-millionaire landlords” that “have overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Renteria also said that I.V.’s limited housing contributes to poor landlord-tenant relations, claiming that I.V. has a vacancy rate of under half of a percent. A “healthy” housing market has a vacancy rate of five percent, he said.</p>\n<p>Some students in attendance expressed concerns about the lack of carbon monoxide detectors and fire alarms in their apartments, as well as issues with returns on security deposits.</p>\n<p>Landlords are required to have carbon monoxide detectors in apartments and failure to do so is in violation of California law, Perry said.</p>\n<p>“If you convince the judge that your landlord knew about his obligations under the law and just plain didn’t do it, you could get three times your security deposit back,” Perry said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, a third-year history of public policy major and I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board member, said that landlords are often aware that their tenants are first-time renters and do not know their legal rights before renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Many of these [landlords] are large, out of town housing conglomerates who provide little-to-no customer service to their tenants,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD began discussions for the creation of a landlord-tenant mediation program last Tuesday but have yet to make a final decision.</p>\n<p>Renteria also condemned the actions of Del Playa Rentals owner James Gelb, who yelled homophobic slurs at I.V. CSD president Ethan Bertrand on Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Tenants Union strongly believes that not a single person should endure abuses in any form or shape,” Renteria said, reading a statement from IVTU.</p>\n<p>Perry held a question and answer session after the meeting for students who needed specific legal advice and advised students to come to the Legal Resource Center before renting in I.V. so that they are fully aware of their rights as tenants.</p>\n<p>The center is located on the second floor of the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>IVTU plans to hold a second town hall during the end of Winter Quarter to further help “reconcile differences” between landlords and tenants, Renteria said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
