Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>PARK IT HERE</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN MIC</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Poets’ Club hosts an open mic at 8 p.m. Thursday at Coffee Collaborative. Organizers welcome poets, musicians and comedians.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLAH BACK</strong><br>\nUCSB Challah for Hunger hosts a bread sale from 12-2 p.m. Friday on the I.V. Food Co-op patio. The purpose of the sale is to raise money and awareness for social justice causes.</p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIAL GARDEN</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>BUILDING A COMMUNITY</strong><br>\nThere will be another meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center at 1 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. Clinic building. The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC) will be hosting the discussion and providing lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>SOW AND REAP</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Food Co-op is hosting a gardening workshop from 12-2 p.m. Sunday on the Co-op patio. The workshop will be led by Oscar Carmona of Healing Grounds Nursery in Goleta.</p>\n<p><strong>VEGAN</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>CHICKEN FOR KIDS</strong><br>\nEating dinner at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch (149 N. Fairview Avenue) between 5-9 p.m. on Tuesday will partially benefit the Isla Vista Youth Projects. The organization is currently undergoing a campaign to raise $300,000 before the end of the year so that it may qualify for an additional $300,000 grant from the county. Isla Vista Youth Projects intends to use the $600,000 to buy their building and close phase one of their capital campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE FOOD</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74124\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74124\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-i-v/","id":4484,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4483,4482,4481],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Drop Series to No. 4 Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"  The UCSB baseball team had its biggest series of the year so far against first-place Cal State Fullerton this past weekend.

In addition, they were able to hand Fullerton its first loss in league play. The Titans move to 31-5 overall and 8-1 in conference play, maintaining hold of first place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Gauchos played a night game on the road, but did not seem to skip a beat from their previous few games as they again jumped ahead to an early lead 1-0 in the first inning. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell extended his hitting streak right away with a single into right center. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled with one out to move Newell to third, who then proceeded to score on freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic’s groundout.</p>\n<p>Bats then went quiet in the game as both starting pitchers were on top of their games. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone pitched seven and two thirds innings and allowed just two runs on 11 hits while striking out three. On the other side for the Titans, freshman Thomas Eshelman topped Pettibone with eight innings of work, just one earned run and seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Neither starter factored in the decision as the game was decided on a blown save and a loss by the Gaucho bullpen, allowing two runs in the bottom of the ninth. The Gauchos put up two runs in the top of the ninth to take a 3-2 lead, but a leadoff bunt in the bottom of the ninth began the trouble for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The bullpen then crumbled as two walks by freshman closer Dylan Hecht loaded the bases. He was replaced by senior reliever Jared Wilson who came in and threw a wild pitch to allow one run before a sac fly ended the game 4-3.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Fullerton came out and roughed up any Gaucho pitcher to take the mound. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome got through just three innings after he allowed six runs on eight hits.</p>\n<p>He was relieved by freshman Hector Lujan, who was also touched up for three runs in just an inning and a third. Freshman pitcher Domenic Mazza then came in to stop the offensive explosion and gave up just one run in his three and two thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Freshman Justin Garza of the Titans earned his seventh win of the season and is still without a loss on the year after his seven inning, nine strikeout performance.</p>\n<p>Game three was a flipped script after the previous day’s drubbing. Nesovic pitched six and two thirds innings of shutout ball. He allowed just four hits and struck out two but walked four en route to his first win of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ two runs would prove to be enough, as the Titans could not muster any offense. Newell saw his hit streak come to an end on Sunday after 12 straight games while Woody Woodward pushed his up to eight games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Up next for Santa Barbara will be a one-game trip to San Diego on Tuesday evening. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/","id":4481,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4480,4479,4478],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

They must raise $300,000 by the Dec. 31 deadline. <em>Courtesy of IVYP</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Youth Projects hopes to cement its role in I.V. this year by raising funds to purchase the Children’s Center building next to the Camino Real Marketplace.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects has been serving since 1971 through four programs: the Children’s Center, the After School Program, the Family Resource Center and Thrive I.V.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center serves children up to five years old, the After School Program serves children in kindergarten through the sixth grade, the Family Resource Center serves families of all sizes and Thrive focuses on “preparing students to enter kindergarten” and the “social-emotional component,” according to Thrive coordinator Julie Lara.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects aims to develop their niche even further by purchasing the Children’s Center building they currently occupy at 6842 Phelps Road. To do this, they must raise $300,000 by Dec. 31 in order to qualify for an additional $300,000 block grant from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center started out as a “very small program with just 20 students,” according to Juan Pimentel, the After School Program director, but has grown to “over 100” with waiting lists for all of the programs.</p>\n<p>From an overall campaign goal of $1.9 million, $1.2 million will be directed toward the Children’s Center, according to LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons why the I.V. Youth Project finds it so necessary to purchase the building is to keep costs low for the children and families who use the services provided by I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges of living in Santa Barbara is the cost of living, and childcare is pretty expensive … so having a children’s center here in I.V. … at either a very low cost or on scholarship most of the time is a really great opportunity,” said Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Just like many of the students at UCSB who worry about rent increases, the I.V. Youth Projects shares those same worries about renting the space for the Children’s Center. Both Pimentel and Miller said owning the building would prevent increases in program costs and save money in the long term.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t too much money to sponsor, say, another parenting class or another need that we might see,” said Lara. By not having to allocate money for rent every month, Lara said she hopes “any funding that does come in we can use for actual programming to make our facilities better.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects will host several fundraisers over the next month, including gatherings at Woodstocks, Panda Express and Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch. The group has also teamed up with Deckers Brand for a holiday shopping event.</p>\n<p>Money is even tighter at I.V. Youth Projects due to the fact that the childcare organization is independent from any national nonprofit organization. Additionally, I.V. is an unincorporated city, so I.V. Youth Projects does not receive city funding, according to Miller.</p>\n<p>“We do have some funding from the city of Goleta and from the County of Santa Barbara,” Miller said, but the organization doesn’t have access to “a lot of the same funding revenue stream that a lot of the other nonprofits might have that are located within a city.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects welcomes donations from any and all I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any donation big or small helps,” Miller said. “It’s very important to us that every child, no matter where they live … deserves to have an equal access to a superior education and a good walk on life.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch fundraiser will be hosted Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 5-9 p.m. and the Panda Express fundraiser will be hosted Friday, Dec. 9, from 12-9 p.m. in the Fairview Shopping Center.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print
