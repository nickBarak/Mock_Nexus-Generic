Perhaps you went to see a mediocre artist because your friend dragged you along. Perhaps the microscopic venue was having technical difficulties. Or perhaps, ooh, [insert musician’s name here] should really stop doing concerts and stick to auto-tuned tracks instead.</p>\n<p>Once again, concerts are not always perfect. But if there is one band that came ridiculously close to challenging that impossible concert standard, it was alt-J this past Tuesday, April 14.</p>\n<p>First off, the venue was majestic. The Santa Barbara Bowl has certainly found its niche, cozily sitting in the lush Santa Barbara hills beside an awe-inspiring view of the ocean and suburbs. In one of the grey plastic foldout chairs, a SB Bowl concert-goer is in a space where the peace and quiet of nature meets the raucousness and hysteria of a concert. It’s the perfect juxtaposition. And a great place to throw back a few cups of Bud Light.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the signature Santa Barbara sunset (the infamous kind that overwhelms Snapchat every day around 7 p.m.) cast a warm glow over the 4,562 seat venue, grey smoke filled the empty stage. Concert-goers donning tight pants and jean jackets rushed to fill their seats as the opening act, Jungle, emerged from the opaque smoke. The funky musical collective wore clothing that followed a cohesive color scheme: green camo, black, white and leather. As they stood almost at the edge of the stage intensely looking out at the crowd, it was impossible not to feel that something badass was about to happen.</p>\n<p>Without waiting another second, the “modern soul musical collective” hailing from London kicked off the show with “Julia,” a catchy song filled with air punches and funky keys. Although only about half of the amphitheater had showed up for the opener, what little crowd that was present was on their feet, unable to resist the urge to dance. And those that were dancing never stopped; Jungle kept the crowd moving for half an hour with their soulful pop.</p>\n<p>Even when it seemed like they were going to slow down the pace for a ballad, the seven-piece group delivered a plot twist and awesomely threw it down on the drums. The conclusion of their set was explosive — the smoke machines turned on full blast and red lights blazed from behind as if a volcano had erupted.</p>\n<p>The volatile performance was the perfect crowd charger before the one and only alt-J. After a brief period of time for water bottle buying and beer refills, the lights dimmed once again for the main act. The sold-out amphitheater filled with the sound of excited cheers and a “holy shit, I’m high.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there was a ringing noise. Four dark silhouettes appeared against pulsing blue lights. The smoke machines turned on full blast again.</p>\n<p>Alt-frickin’-J.</p>\n<p>“Sleeplessly embracing, butterflies and needles…” sang lead singer Joe Newman in his low, strangely seductive voice. The British four-piece stayed stationary in their respective spots, dim figures backlit by wandering spotlights and smoke.</p>\n<p>Alt-J’s latest album, <em>This Is All Yours</em>, quickly sailed to #1 in the UK after its release in September 2014. Riding on the success of both their new album and their first album, <em>An Awesome Wave</em>, the indie rock band has toured nonstop since last year. But despite the fact that alt-J performed at 17 festivals in a 365-day span, this concert was the first time they touched down in Santa Barbara. “Cheers. This is our first one ever in Santa Barbara. So far, beautiful beaches, beautiful weather, 10 out of 10,” Newman said in his quaint British accent.</p>\n<p>As “Matilda” rang through the speakers, dreamy pink lights reminiscent of Santa Barbara sunsets illuminated the stage. Throughout the concert, each song was punctuated by lights that flashed with each beat. Multi-colored lights swept crazily over the crowd. More relaxed songs featured ribbons of white light which penetrated the darkness and engulfed the band members. Newman concluded “Matilda” with another “cheers”: his favorite word of the night.</p>\n<p>Alt-J rocked the Bowl with unparalleled style. To the end, the crowd was on their feet, rocking bodies and waving arms. And as the breeze picked up, it was as if the tall trees that flanked the stage seemed to be swaying along with the music too.</p>\n<p>“[Santa Barbara] has given us such a warm welcome. We can’t wait to come back,” said Newman before waving and leaving with the rest of the band. Cheers, alt-J.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62546\" style=\"width: 611px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

id=\"caption-attachment-57953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of <em>Margo Rey</em></p></div>\n<p>In an interview last fall with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>, singer-songwriter Margo Rey said, “I feel now that every performance is this living organism, and the audience has a big part of what this performance is going to evolve into. It’s my chance to give them the best performance I can and win new fans.”</p>\n<p>At her concert at the SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on April 1, Rey certainly won over a few new fans. Standing onstage, gloriously donned in her trademark all-leather outfit (as a matter of fact, leather seemed to be a theme onstage), the singer put on a thunderous show and lent her rock goddess soul to the audience.</p>\n<p>While Rey is indeed a rock goddess, her music genre should not necessarily be sorted into the broad genre of “rock.” It is more than that. Rey’s roots are deeply intertwined with both the jazz and rock scenes. In the early years of her career, she was the leader of an all-girl rock band called Debutante and later, a Latin Jazz/R&amp;B group called Sambuca. Nowadays, Rey calls her music “Organica:” a blend of jazz and pop that is audibly influenced by the keys, rhythmic guitars and groovy downtempo beats of the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although a native of Arlington, Texas, whenever Rey appears at SOhO, it is with her devoted band from L.A.: a diverse cast of characters ranging from a badass and oh-so-stylish Asian-American, female bassist to a shaggy-haired drummer clad in a loosely buttoned dress shirt.</p>\n<p>Together, the groovy bunch took the dimly lit venue to a new level of chill. Deep blue and orange lights illuminated their jiving bodies as they picked guitars and played the keys. Balding heads of the middle-aged SOhO goers surrounding the stage nodded along with the rhythm of the drums.</p>\n<p>Shrouded in candlelight with sparkly eyelids and slicked, jet black hair, Rey kicked off the show with “I Saw You,” a sassy post-breakup song about an uninvited chance encounter with an ex. Her relentless energy reverberated off of the deep burgundy walls of the venue as she rocked her hips — covered in, you guessed it, leather — back and forth.</p>\n<p>Before the next song, Rey told the story of when her husband and two-time Grammy nominated comedian, Ron White, proposed to her before getting on a plane that dipped about ten thousand feet. Shaken, he managed to say, “Give me that ring back, Jesus doesn’t like this [proposal].” This short anecdote was the perfect lead into a soft, sentimental melody about White, “I Give my Heart.” Sitting down on a wooden stool, Rey crooned into the microphone and gracefully sailed through the high notes in her song about her “one and only.”</p>\n<p>Later, the singer kicked up the volume again for “Habit,” her breakout single that landed her a spot at #1 on the Billboard charts. Filled with sharp and upbeat keys delivered by a spunky twenty-something-year-old wearing a Superman tee, “Habit” embodied her trademark musical style. She said afterwards, “I coined my music ‘Organica’ because it’s not rock and it’s not pop. I believe music is a living organism … it’s created on stage by humans, not machines.”</p>\n<p>This philosophy shone through her concert as she put her all into her songs, rocking and prancing across the stage as her band exerted the same amount of vitality. Her songs were all kinds of quirky fun — one featured a cool violin solo while another, she admitted in a voice filled with Texas twang, was written in honor of “bushy seventies porn, y’all.” Rey delivered a couple covers as well, including the bluesy “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers and the more contemporary classic, “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes.</p>\n<p>The energy did not stop once and drove to her hit ballad about courage in a time of hardship, “Colors.”</p>\n<p>“I had cancer twice,” the singer began, “and it felt like I was never going to get back on stage … but I like being bald. It’s fun.”</p>\n<p>Rey’s vivacious show ended on a high note with her newer song, “Beautiful Train Wreck.” Before Rey began her set, Ron White had introduced her as “the most talented person I know.” Her fantastic performance proved the statement true.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/margo-reys-organica-style-brings-a-little-something-for-everyone/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/margo-reys-organica-style-brings-a-little-something-for-everyone/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/margo-reys-organica-style-brings-a-little-something-for-everyone/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/margo-reys-organica-style-brings-a-little-something-for-everyone/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/margo-reys-organica-style-brings-a-little-something-for-everyone/","id":6984,"author":{"id":732,"name":"Mackenzie Hart"},"related":[6983,6982,6981],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Grammy-Winning Jazz Singer Cassandra Wilson Comes to UCSB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CassandraWilson_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CassandraWilson_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Sunday, Feb. 22, Campbell Hall celebrated the music of Billie Holiday with the vocals of jazz singer Cassandra Wilson.

The auditorium was filled with jazz enthusiasts of all ages, eager to hear the sultry sounds of the Grammy-winning musician. After an encouraging round of applause from the audience, the sweet sounds of a saxophone introduced the singer and brought the audience to their feet. In a tribute to the works of the late Billie Holiday, Wilson gave an astounding performance that was even bigger than her hair.</p>\n<p>Wilson couldn’t have appeared more at ease onstage in her sensible shoes and a gold-sequined top to match her golden hair. Her look was simple and elegant and her energy was captivating. She began the Billie Holiday tribute with “The Way You Look Tonight.” Her voice was sweet and sentimental, with a husky edge resembling the great Anita Baker. The crowd swayed in harmony to the romantic tune as she sang the lyrics, “Just thinking of you and the way you look tonight.”</p>\n<p>The singer informed the audience that this night was in celebration of the late Billie Holiday’s 100th birthday. Wilson’s show, titled “Coming Forth By Day: A Celebration of Billie Holiday,” showcased music mainly from the legend’s final album of her career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During “Don’t Explain,” a war for attention — common in jazz — between Wilson’s voice and the sound of the saxophone erupted. Wilson then introduced her band, who played on the bass, guitar, piano, violin, drums and of course, the saxophone. The unique sound of the electric guitar was a bold choice for a jazz band and it gave an edgier tone to certain songs. Throughout the performance, the band was just as precise and smooth as Wilson herself. Even their warm-ups sounded like hit songs.</p>\n<p>After some slow, romantic tunes, the band went on to play more upbeat music like Holiday’s “What a Little Moonlight Can Do” and “Crazy He Calls Me.” Wilson’s enthusiasm radiated throughout the auditorium as she danced barefoot onstage and did some scatting.  Her witty banter filled the room with smiles and laughter as she called out the absurdity of the guitarist wearing sunglasses on a dark stage.</p>\n<p>The night concluded with an original song by Wilson, the only one of the night. “Last Song (for Lester)” was a number Wilson from the perspective of Billie Holiday to sing at the funeral of friend and fellow musician Lester Young, who died in 1959. The jazz singer delivered an authentic and sentimental performance of the song, much like she did throughout the entire show. The audience stood on their feet and cheered for an encore, which the band obliged and performed one final song, “I Love My Man.”</p>\n<p>Cassandra Wilson and her band gave an outstanding performance that combined styles of the old and the new. Her smooth, heart-felt voice, matched with the precise sounds of the band, gave new meaning to some of Billie Holiday’s classic hits. The night was a blast for the gifted vocalist and the audience that cheered her on.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61668\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-cassandra-wilson-comes-to-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61668\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-cassandra-wilson-comes-to-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-cassandra-wilson-comes-to-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-cassandra-wilson-comes-to-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-cassandra-wilson-comes-to-ucsb/","id":6985,"author":{"id":747,"name":"Jessica Gresham"},"related":[6984,6983,6982],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Giraffage Plays Rollercoaster of Feels","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Giraffage-yo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Giraffage-yo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the backmost corner table of the decidedly vacant and dimly lit VIP section of Santa Barbara’s EOS Lounge sat a deadly concoction of Jameson, ginger beer and an extra dash of Canada Dry.

The owner of the drink, Charlie Yin, was deadly focused on the Macbook illuminating his face. His headphones were plugged in to drown out the consistent thud of the bass coming from the speakers of the warm-up DJ.</p>\n<p>Yin, known to most by his stage moniker, Giraffage, looked like he was toying with a track that <em>could</em> very well be his next release, but will more than likely join his hefty vault of instrumental experiments that he says, “will probably never see the light of day.” He looked tired. This was the second to last stop on the <em>No Reason</em> tour, and he says he’s looking forward to “getting off tour and producing full time.”</p>\n<p>His outfit, a simple pair of dark jeans and a charcoal-grey hairy-knit sweater, was minimalist yet stylish, a reflection his off-stage character — a humble intellectual moonlighting as a superstar.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Bay Area-based DJ received widespread critical acclaim and an explosion in popularity following his recent tour with Porter Robinson and his latest EP, <em>No Reason</em>. Despite this, Yin worries that he “could fall off in six months … [because] with the internet, music is such a fickle industry.”</p>\n<p>While the future of Yin’s musical career is uncertain (and I’m optimistic to say the least), one thing is clear: He has a strong sense of humility. It makes him relatable and is refreshing in his profession, which is dominated by no shortage of hubris and hyper-inflated egos.</p>\n<p>But don’t let these comments make any doubts about Yin’s stage presence. The crowd was already riled from Spazzkid’s bouncy set and was amped for more. Giraffage took to the decks well into the evening with few words. His signature intro was met with cheers and coos from the crowd of youths. The club was bouncing to favorites such as “Tell Me” and the PandaBoY remix of “Marimba.”</p>\n<p>Yin describes his music as experimental electronic, and this was reflected pretty clearly in the crowd. The dance floor attendees were not the usual suspects of ties and miniskirts. There seemed to be a more prevalent population of hip kids than the average Santa Barbara club evening, and these hip kids were most likely ’Raffage devotees.</p>\n<p>The set was a rollercoaster of different feels with everything from older hits off of the XXYYXX collaboration album, <em>Even Though</em>, to the elusive and legally-controversial remix of R. Kelly’s “Ignition,” to the deeply distorted Giraffage remix of “Party in the USA.” And at no point throughout the set did the crowd show any signs of tiring.</p>\n<p>The track list was a good balance of trademarked, videogame-reminiscent glitchy synths, minimal metallophone drops and a modest amount of sing-a-long crowd pleasers. Its conclusion was met with yells and scattered applause and the majority of the audience filed out of the main entrance, leaving a half-empty floor for the closing act.</p>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, Giraffage’s set concluded the night and proved to be one of the most well-constructed and varied performances I’d experienced since ZHU’s debut at HARD Day of the Dead. And he wins a few extra points for making a Miley Cyrus song sound sophisticated.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61674\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/giraffage-plays-rollercoaster-of-feels/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61674\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/giraffage-plays-rollercoaster-of-feels/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/giraffage-plays-rollercoaster-of-feels/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/giraffage-plays-rollercoaster-of-feels/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/giraffage-plays-rollercoaster-of-feels/","id":6986,"author":{"id":718,"name":"Alex Bocknek"},"related":[6985,6984,6983],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
