And I don’t care if someone gets mad at me or I’m just going to bring up these issues that I’m passionate about or that my constituents are telling me to,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas began his career in campus politics as a senator in the 2018-2019 school year. Now, he’s finishing out his term as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and preparing to pass on the baton to his successor, third-year political science major Yasamin Salari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over his year-long term, Ornelas said he learned to adopt a more restrained attitude and balanced approach to serving the study body. He said some of the best advice he received during his term was from Katya Armistead, UC Santa Barbara’s dean of student life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She told me ‘You’re going to have to learn how to choose your battles and if it’s something that you really want to go into, then give it your all and don’t look back,’” Ornelas said. “That’s not anything I was thinking about last year. Like last year I was just like, I’m going to call out anyone and see what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides his original platform goals — which included creating a monthly farmer’s market in Isla Vista, hosting special-topic classes co-taught by professors and students and solving mold issues in housing — Ornelas’ position as EVPLA required his participation in frequent student and administration discussions across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these discussions included higher-ups from the UC Police Department (UCPD) or UCSB administration, like Chancellor Henry T. Yang, and gave him a look into important conversations happening around campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was privileged to just [have] these really unique situations that students would never be able to be in the room for. I was the student that was allowed into the room. So acknowledging that privilege but also struggling sometimes with kind of feelings of imposter syndrome and stuff like that was really interesting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he dealt with self-doubt in some of these discussions and teetered between feeling the need to speak out and not knowing when to step in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had moments where I was like, ‘Okay, you need to be in this room, you need to say something,’ but also struggling with like, ‘Okay, why am I in this room? Am I qualified to be in this room?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said the pressure to please everyone was much greater in an executive position than as a senator. Over the past year, he said the balance between mollifying the university, serving his constituency and accomplishing his platform points proved difficult. In the end, he was not able to accomplish all of his platform points, including the co-taught classes, but he pointed to a few moments in his term that exemplified his commitment to serving students’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those includes the district supervisor </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/3rd-district-supervisor-candidates-field-community-questions-at-isla-vista-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall in February, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organized by Ornelas’ office, that featured two of three candidates running to be the Third District Supervisor for Santa Barbara County, a seat currently held by Joan Hartmann. Ornelas said the event was important for I.V. residents to hear from the candidates, since “the supervisors literally determine so much for us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he acknowledged the drama regarding the absence of one candidate, Bruce Porter, at the meeting. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter initially planned to attend the meeting, but after some confusion surrounding the date of the town hall, Porter said he would not be attending and asked Ornelas’ office to reschedule the event. Ornelas responded to Porter saying that while his office would not be rescheduling the event, it was “very open to hosting another town hall event.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was kind of one of those moments like, ‘Okay, we need to remain nonpartisan and just like not politicize this.’ And so our response was pretty much like, ‘We’re sorry [that] you can’t be here,’” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornerlas also had success in organizing open markets in I.V. that brought music, vendors and services to Little Acorn Park once a quarter. He originally planned to bring downtown Santa Barbara’s farmers markets to I.V. to provide the same access to fresh produce, but decided that the potential collaboration would place too many restrictions on I.V.’s open market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPLA office instead sponsored the I.V. Open Markets, which had been operating independently since before he took office. The office’s sponsorship relieved the financial burden for vendors who participated in the market by covering deposits and paying for the park rental. His office also helped to organize the logistical elements, like waste and water services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he was especially proud of the expansion of the market over his term, which included bringing multiple bands — such as Art Official and Careless Club — and increasing the number of participating vendors and attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a lot of planning that went into that and we had like thousands of people and like the most vendors we’d ever had and everyone liked the music,” Ornelas said. “That was kind of just a passion project that was really rewarding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One project he said has been his most impactful — and one that Ornelas hopes Salari will continue to develop — are the relationships he said he has fostered between the UCPD and the EVPLA office, which took shape in the development of the police collaborative board and other working groups. Ornelas’ predecessor, Jeike Meijer, helped to </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-17/police-collaborative-board-breaks-ground-with-first-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch the program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toward the end of her term in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ornelas planned to use the board to address community members’ concerns about the allegations </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made in several lawsuits against UCPD,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the task proved more tedious and complicated than planned. Ornelas said his office had planned a community forum to facilitate discussion about the lawsuits, but after the coronavirus pandemic cancelled in-person classes at UCSB, the possibility for a forum thinned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Ornelas said his relationships, in particular with Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder and UCPD officer Ariel Bournes, produced benefits for the community in other ways, like discussions about safety for major events like Halloween and Deltopia, the promotion of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the party registration program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the UCPD instagram account created by Bournes, who contacted Ornelas for advice about creating the profile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the coronavirus pandemic threw a wrench in many plans for this spring quarter, Ornelas said that as students’ needs shifted under the new circumstances, his office was able to meet those needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his successor, Salari, Ornelas said he hopes that she will be able to carry on the work that his office has put in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of the groundwork for the next EVPLA and a lot of it was already here for me too, so I’m hopeful that when Yasamin comes in, she can see the work that we had done and kind of start her term up with that,” Ornelas said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the next EVPLA’s term still involves some uncertainty as to how the duties will be carried out during a world pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re looking at the possibility of a remote fall [quarter], what does that look like for the next EVPLA?” he asked. “I’m not exactly sure.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Senate, taking 12 of the 23 seats on the table. The Isla Vista Party won 10 seats, while the last seat went to engineering candidate Diana Reyes Carrillo, who ran independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be no College of Creative Studies (CCS) senator and no fifth on-campus senator in the 70th Senate due to a shortage of candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full list of senator-elects can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/live-a-s-election-results-2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notable victory from tonight’s election was that of College of Letters &amp; Science Senator-elect Justice Dumlao. He previously lost twice in A.S. elections – once as an External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate in 2016-2017 and again in the 2017-2018 presidential race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 32.34% of the undergraduate student body voted in this year’s election, compared to 39.7% of last year. According to the A.S. Elections Board, 6,980 students undergraduate students voted in this year’s election, as opposed to the 8,233 who voted in the 2017-2018 election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-03/a-s-elections-sees-increase-in-voter-turnout/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first year since 2015</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that voter turnout has dropped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a third-year political science major, is UCSB’s first female Asian-American president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am just so grateful to actually represent the community, my community, the Asian American community,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so blessed that I have so much support… The night went really well and I am really proud of everyone that was able to win and feel the experience of running. I am very proud of Zion running too, we are both women of color and I am very proud… for what we both did. I am excited to do a lot of good work and [make] tangible change.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race between External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidates Christian Ornelas and Matthew Griffin came the closest. With 3,012 votes, Ornelas narrowly defeated Griffin, who earned 2,915, by a margin of 97 votes – a mere 1.6%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to A.S. Legal Code, “A recount shall be given whenever the difference between the Candidates is two percent (2%) or less of the votes cast for the office; or whenever evidence of an erroneous count is shown and called to the attention of the Elections Board Chairperson or the Senate within one (1) week (seven (7) days) after the vote has been announced.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a potential recount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that I have really big shoes to fill, so I’m excited to start working with Jeike, start having our transition meetings, just to really make sure that I can live up to all the work that she’s done because she’s done a lot for this campus,” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President-elect Alli Adam ran unopposed after her would-be opponent, Yash Nagpal, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/isla-vista-party-will-not-run-internal-vice-president-candidate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dropped out of the race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during Week 1 of Spring Quarter, citing health concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has a bright future for 2019-2020, and that’s all I have to say,” Adam, a third-year political science major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Nguyen was also unopposed in his race for Student Advocate General. Nguyen ran for an off-campus Senate seat with Campus United during the 2017-2018 school year and served on the 69th Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect Daevionne Beasley defeated Isla Vista Party candidate Alexandra Leal Silva by a margin of 513 votes. Beasley, a second-year sociology major, emphasized that he wants to continue working with Leal Silva during his EVPSA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m most excited to reach out to [Leal Silva] and see exactly what ideas she has from working in the EVPSA office these last three years … I know that she was so instrumental in keeping the office going when there was no EVPSA, I really need her input and insight,” Beasley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reached out to each other before and we said that no matter the results, we’d work with each other and I hope that continues and that the sentiment was real, and I can’t wait to see where both of our ideas will take us forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All fee reaffirmations passed, and the sole new fee on the ballot – a fee for the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) – also passed with 64.93% of the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most A.S. elections, the days leading up to the final results were filled with contentious jabs between the two parties, but it was the day of elections when A.S. Presidential candidate Zion Solomon faced heavy backlash on social media, notably on a thread posted under the subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon’s platform point of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposing a lock-in fee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help transgender students with gender reassignment surgery was attacked on Facebook, Instagram and a Reddit forum, with the </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/bgzhu3/as_president_candidate_zion_solomon_wants_to/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit thread receiving more than </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 comments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=campus%20united&amp;ref=eyJzaWQiOiIwLjA0MTU5MDk3MjY3OTc0Mzg3NiIsInFzIjoiSlRWQ0pUSXlZMkZ0Y0hWekpUSXdkVzVwZEdWa0pUSXlKVFZFIiwiZ3YiOiJiZWUwOWY5M2ZhNzMyY2ZhNTlhMWNiNmQ5ZjQ1MGQzODkyNDI0ZTQ5IiwiZW50X2lkcyI6W10sImJzaWQiOiJkODM2MGIyY2E1NTdkOGM4ODQ0NjcxODBiNDJkNzMyOSIsInByZWxvYWRlZF9lbnRpdHlfaWRzIjpudWxsLCJwcmVsb2FkZWRfZW50aXR5X3R5cGUiOm51bGwsInJlZiI6ImJyX3RmIiwiY3NpZCI6bnVsbCwiaGlnaF9jb25maWRlbmNlX2FyZ3VtZW50IjpudWxsLCJjbGllbnRfdGltZV9tcyI6MTU1NjI1NDg4NTU0Mn0&amp;epa=SEARCH_BOX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted a statement on its Facebook page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> following the widespread sharing of the Reddit thread, condemning both the thread and tagging the Isla Vista Party in its post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as a party do not take responsibility for this Reddit account as the individuals who created it were not part of our party nor associated it, and we condemn any form of transphobia.

Beasley said the two did not have any sexual encounter in his dorm room that night and has welcomed a Title IX investigation into his behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley has called the rumors about his behavior “lies” and said, in a statement to the Nexus, “these false accusations are doing far more than just threatening my presidency; they are attempting to undermine every aspect of my humanity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not answer many of the specific questions posed by the Nexus about the claims in this article, saying he wanted the Title IX Office to investigate them and that UCSB administrators had “advised party leaders to respect the confidential investigative process of Title IX.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student making the allegations said that after the party in 2018, Beasley had insisted on taking him back to Beasley’s dorm room in Anacapa Residence Hall, where Beasley gave him clothes to wear because the student had thrown up and someone had spilled alcohol on him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student said he was conscious of what was happening as Beasley began touching him, including under his pants, but that he was close to “blacking out.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know things are happening, but you’re kind of like, at least for me, ‘I’m just gonna let it happen,’ like my body is tired,” the student said, describing his state at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He started to feel me up, and I really remember him going under my clothes and stuff,” the  student said. “I think he might’ve asked me at some point, ‘Oh, like, is this okay?’ But again, all I could do was grunt.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess he took that as a yes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student said he thinks Beasley may have believed he was acting appropriately, but that the student’s intoxicated state should have made it clear that he was not able to consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Beasley and the student said Beasley’s two roommates were in the room with them that night. Beasley provided their names and contact information, and the two initially agreed to speak to the Nexus, but one later declined, saying he did not want to interfere with a Title IX investigation, and the other stopped responding to inquiries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also provided the names of two other students who he said were with him and the student on the night of the party, but they also declined to speak to the Nexus after initially agreeing to do so. One said she was declining to speak “out of my respect for Daevionne’s wishes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two friends of the student making the accusation said the student had told them, as they discussed the previous night in a dorm room the next morning, that Beasley had made him feel uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those friends, a third-year art history major who asked to be identified only by her initials, S.K., said she remembered the student telling them that Beasley had touched him inappropriately the night before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to S.K., the student told the two that he had tried to tell Beasley “no,” but that he was so drunk, it was difficult to get the words out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other friend, a third-year film and media studies major, said she remembered less about what the student had told her and S.K., but that she remembered him describing an uncomfortable experience with Beasley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film and media studies major also said she was with the student on the night of the party and had questioned whether Beasley should take him back to campus, given that the student was “almost sloppy and slurring” because of how drunk he was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same friend provided text messages from a week later that showed that the student felt uncomfortable about the idea of being alone with Beasley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Erghhh imma try and not b alone with him,” the student texted her on March 2, 2018, after she told him that Beasley had invited her and her friends to a party.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, when the student texted the same friend and said he was walking home alone through I.V., the woman suggested that he call Beasley. The student wrote in a text that he didn’t want to because “it creeps me out what happened last time i drank with him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student told the Nexus that he confronted Beasley in person about a year later, in February 2019, and said he was “still not okay” with what had happened, referencing the dorm room encounter the previous February. The student said he told Beasley that “what he did was wrong and assault.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley told the Nexus last month that he believed the student was referring to an earlier incident, in January 2018, in which the two had a sexual encounter while they were both drunk at a UCSB-affiliated conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the confrontation, Beasley reached out to the student, saying that the confrontation was “a little hostile,” but that he hoped to speak with the student further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anyways, I’ve been thinking about what you said, and while I don’t necessarily feel the same way as you did about the situation, I still want to learn why you feel that way,” Beasley wrote in identical messages sent over text and Facebook Messenger, which both parties provided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If an apology is needed, then I’d gladly do so 100%,” he continued. “I don’t want anyone in their life to feel violated or neglected or any range of emotions you might have been or are currently feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus began investigating claims against Beasley after receiving an anonymous email on April 17 that was also sent to The Bottom Line and the two campus political parties: Isla Vista Party (IVP) and Campus United (CU). Beasley has run with CU for the last two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, who subsequently came forward to the Nexus, said he was not involved with the letter and does not know who sent it. The Nexus has not been able to identify the sender; the message was sent using Gmail’s confidential email service and could not be replied to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVP leadership later published a copy of the letter on its social media platforms on May 2, just over a week after the election ended. Justice Dumlao, a member of the IVP leadership, said the party was not involved with sending the anonymous email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said party leaders had interviewed Beasley as a potential party candidate for A.S. Senate in the spring of 2018, but decided not to slate him after a woman had relayed the sexual encounter that the student had with Beasley at the UCSB-affiliated conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student told the Nexus that what had happened at the conference was consensual, but “creepy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I began the encounter willing, but quickly began to feel uncomfortable and like I was about to pass out,” he said in an email. “Back then I felt that I should be polite so I didn’t say no right away but it was clear that I was extremely drunk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following IVP’s publication of the anonymous letter, Izzy Mitchell, a second-year communications and economics double major, created a petition to recall Beasley from his position. Mitchell said she is not affiliated with IVP or CU. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell’s petition would need signatures from 10% of students who voted in the Spring 2020 presidential race, which amounts to 542 students, before it would be presented to the A.S. Senate. Then, two-thirds of senators would need to vote in favor of holding a recall election for it to happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition has over 600 signatures as of Sunday, according to Mitchell. It is unclear how many of those signatures are from students who voted in the presidential election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said that he respects students’ right to ask for his recall, but that he has no intention of stepping down. Doing so, he said, would only “affirm these lies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders of CU, the party that slated Beasley, said in a Facebook post that they would abide by the results of the Title IX investigation, saying that if “these accusations are proven true” after the investigation, they have “every intention” of disaffiliating with Beasley and calling on him to resign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, we will not irresponsibly discuss unproven allegations,” the party wrote in the statement, “and will not punish anyone based on unsubstantiated claims.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell said she agreed Beasley has a right to due process but remained frustrated that most students did not know about the claims against Beasley until after voting ended, despite the anonymous letter being sent to both campus political parties and newspapers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was very frustrated that it is very clear that these emails were sent out to Campus United, to Daily Nexus and Isla Vista Party, and I felt like it was not okay as leaders of our institution to deny the public the right to know that there is something going on,” Mitchell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not fair to the student body that after they voted, that this has come up,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><i>[Updated 7:20 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include the number of signatures on the petition as of Sunday. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
