Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On Sunday, the UCSB men’s tennis team took on visiting San Diego State University in just its second home match of the season. The Gauchos won their second straight in Santa Barbara, edging out the Aztecs 5-2. With this win, UCSB improves to 2-2 overall and SDSU is currently 3-2 with the loss.</p>\n<p>“Playing at home is truly phenomenal. There’s really just nothing like it,” sophomore Morgan Mays explained. “The fans were great and I really have to give them thanks for their support. They really helped pull us through today.”</p>\n<p>Mays was truly surrounded by support from the get-go when he and his teammate, junior Andrew Riminton, found themselves in the tiebreaker match for the doubles point. They battled to a 6-4 win to grab their first doubles point of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sophomore stud found himself playing right in front of his cheering crowd of gold when it was time to break off into singles as well. Playing in the No. 1 spot for his Gaucho team, he faced off against senior Thorsten Bertsch, who came in with a singles record of 2-1 on the season. Mays fought hard with great energy and boasted his skills with superior placement on every point. For the second time of the day, Mays bested Bertsch, in two straight sets of 6-4.</p>\n<p>“I executed my game plan really perfectly,” Mays said. “I wanted to dictate with my forehand and hit the shots he gave me, and I was very consistent.”</p>\n<p>Another exciting win for the Gauchos came from the No. 5 court where junior Nathan Eshmade looked for his second win of the day after contributing to UCSB’s doubles round. Eshmade took the lead early, winning the first set 6-4 before dropping the second by the same score. He finished his opponent off in the tiebreaker with ease allowing him just two games in the set, and clinched the Gaucho’s victory for the day.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was another Gaucho to add a point on the board for his team. The rookie continued to show his potential, winning his match on the No. 3 court in straight sets of 6-3, 6-3.</p>\n<p>The final match of the day took place on the No. 6 court where sophomore Teague Hamilton played to further stretch the lead of the Gaucho’s overall victory. He silenced his opponent in the first set, winning 6-0, and then edged him out once more in the second 7-6 to give the Gauchos a 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road next weekend playing at No. 37 University of San Diego Saturday and UC Irvine on Sunday. Matches are set to start at 1:30 p.m. and noon, respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/","id":627,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[626,625,624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles","biography":"Not available","articles":[78,81,85,86,101,103,108,110,111,113,115,116,120,122,125,127,129,130,132,140,141,142,145,148,151,156,160,161,165,180,181,448,523,584,627,924,925,927,957,958,960,978,980,1008,1010,1011,1012,1015,1026,1027,1030,1031,1036,1047,1049,1050,1073,1082,1084,1089,1766,1770,1771,1987,1989,1997,2019,2026,2027,2034,3288,3297],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Set to Begin Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s almost like déjà-vu.

In its final regular season game on the road, Santa Barbara defeated the Aggies for the first time in seven games to enter playoffs in stride. Then, as the underdog sixth seed, it then went on to win three straight games and win the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>“We all know that it’s win or go home, so there’s no reason I should have to light a fire under them or have to find some crazy way to motivate them,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We were in the same situation last year and they should remember at least those emotions from what we’re going to have to do to win three games in a row.”</p>\n<p>However, the team also knows back-to-back titles won’t come easy as the reigning Big West Tournament Champions have an extra target on its back in an already competitive conference.</p>\n<p>“I told them, ‘it can’t be shazam.’ There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it happen like it did last year.” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins postseason play tomorrow night in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at UC Irvine, the same location the Gauchos started their championship run last year. After earning a bye through the first round of play as a result of securing fourth place, Santa Barbara will play the highest remaining seed after tonight’s first round games.</p>\n<p>That means the Gauchos could see Long Beach state, Cal state Northridge or UC Davis, teams that they have gone 5-1 against during regular season play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve beaten them all, so it doesn’t matter who we play,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s going to be an all-out battle no matter who we play, but we’ll be ready for them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished conference play at 11-7 and enter tonight’s game at 15-15 overall. Yet, UCSB knows that none of that matters now when it’s win or go home.</p>\n<p>“Like coach said, we’re 0-0 now,” Nesbit said. “Everything’s kind of starting over. I think we’re excited to have a clean slate going into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>The only thing UCSB hopes to take into the playoffs is its momentum as the Gauchos have won their last three games.</p>\n<p>“[The momentum is] something we need to carry us through the tournament, but it’s a completely different mindset,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “It’s about showing up on any given day and being the best team in the end. It’s do or die.”</p>\n<p>In its last game at home for senior day, Santa Barbara won back-to-back home games for the first time this season, defeating UC Irvine 49-40. The game began with a perfect script for UCSB as its three seniors each scored a basket to start the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, offensive rebounds earned the Gauchos the victory. A second chance basket by senior forward Sweets Underwood gave UCSB a four point lead with 50 seconds to go and would be enough to secure the win.</p>\n<p>“I think that at different times in the game, different people stepped up,” Mitchell said. “We made plays. I’m proud of our kids and finding a way to pull it out late in the game.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos won’t be playing at home, that might prove beneficial for UCSB. Santa Barbara has played some of its best basketball on the road and enters the Tournament with the second-best road record in the Big West at 8-5.</p>\n<p>Not knowing which team it will face, UCSB has had no other option but to focus on itself.</p>\n<p>“We have the skills, we have the talent and we know what we have to do, but it’s just doing that from the tip to the final buzzer,” Tilleman said. “Now during tournament play, everyone’s going to show up playing their best game, so we can’t have lapses where we’re not getting things done, so it’s having that focus and having that leadership.”</p>\n<p>All season long, UCSB has won games with its defense. The team ranks first in scoring defense and field goal percentage defense, holding its opponents just 52.8 points per game and 36.0 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Defense will be especially critical not only to slow down the other team, but it also fuels the Gauchos’ offense. Santa Barbara is at its best when it can get out in transition.</p>\n<p>“Everything runs through our defense,” Tilleman said. “Especially in these last few games, it’s obvious that we’re best offensively when we get a stop on defense and we can transition. If we let them score, we have to get into a set offense and they get to get into their defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite ranking last in scoring offense, UCSB ranks third in field goal percentage, shooting 40.2 percent from the field. Execution will be very important for the Gauchos entering postseason play, considering the fact that they will most likely see zone defenses the majority of the tournament, which they have struggled against at times.</p>\n<p>“Our offensive execution is more mental than anything, so we know that when we have to score, we will,” Nesbit said. “We just have to relax on offense, trust the patterns and just play basketball because Coach gives us all the freedom in the world. We have to know what to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos offensively is Underwood, who was named to the Big West first team Monday. Underwood ranks tenth in the Big West in scoring with 11.9 points per game, fourth in rebounding with 9.3 per game and third in field goal percentage at 48.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB is not a team that relies on one player and has many who can step up. Nesbit, an All-Big West honorable mention this season, averages 10.6 points per game and junior guard Melissa Zornig averages 8.4 points per game. Senior guard Angelei Aguirre, junior guard Destini Mason and Tilleman have all proved they can step up when needed as well.</p>\n<p>“Every player has played critical roles in helping us win games and that’s how we want to approach the tournament,” Mitchell said. “They’ve all been there, they’ve all helped us win different games in different ways and they should all be confident and know that at any moment, they’re name could be called.”</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB is a veteran team. The team returns eight of its 11 players from last year’s roster that took the conference tournament title, so experience could give Santa Barbara the edge.</p>\n<p>“The games are back to back to back and you’re just out there having fun,” Nesbit said. “It’s an exciting time of the year – March Madness. This is what any college player is waiting for, so we’re excited.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Wednesday at the Bren Events Center is set for 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first game, which begins at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50588\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-12/gauchos-set-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50588\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-12/gauchos-set-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-12/gauchos-set-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-12/gauchos-set-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-12/gauchos-set-to-begin-postseason-play/","id":624,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[623,622,621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to SDSU for WNIT Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s rare that in sports, or life for that matter, that you get a second chance.

We have nothing to lose.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s last game resulted in a devastating 62-43 loss to rival Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament. Although UCSB got off to a fantastic start, holding the Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to begin the game, the Gauchos struggled to score the basketball, shooting just 34.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Add to that a 20-point second half from Cal Poly’s 6’5’’ junior center Molly Schlemer and UCSB began to watch its season potentially come to an end. However, three days later, the Gauchos became of one of four Big West teams selected for the WNIT. This marks the second straight postseason appearance in Mitchell’s two-year reign.</p>\n<p>“It’ll help us to have a little edge because we’re still upset about that [game] and we don’t like how that game potentially could’ve ended our season,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think that’s going to put some fuel to our fire and if anything, it’s going to motivate us for this game coming up tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>San Diego State will also enter tomorrow’s matchup looking for redemption. The Aztecs had a spectacular season, posting a 15-1 Mountain West record to win the regular season title for the second straight year. The team also won 17 consecutive games and tied the program record for most wins in a single season. As a result of winning its conference, SDSU earned an automatic bid to the WNIT, but fell short of going to the NCAA Tournament when it lost to Fresno State in the Mountain West Tournament Championship.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious that they’re extremely athletic and I’m sure they feel like they should be in the NCAA Tournament with the record that they have,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I’m sure they’ll come out and we’ll probably see one of their best games.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos are 12-18 against San Diego State. However, the last time these two teams faced off was Jan. 2, 1999 and UCSB won 78-50.</p>\n<p>Dominating the conference, the Aztecs rank first in the Mountain West in scoring defense, holding teams to 52.4 points per game. However, San Diego St. is an offensive minded team, averaging 68.7 points per game while shooting 43.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge for SDSU is senior guard Courtney Clements, who ranks second in the Mountain West and first on the team in scoring with 17.5 points per game. In addition, senior guard Chelsea Hopkins, a transfer from Duke, averages 13.5 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.8 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“Hopkins likes to get in the paint,” Mitchell said. “She can knock down a three, but she wants to get in the gaps and make things happen. And with Clements, you have to contest the shot. You can’t foul her or give her open looks from three. You want to try and make her put it on the floor and make her a jump shooter.”</p>\n<p>Of course, SDSU will be facing the toughest defensive team in the Big West as UCSB holds teams to a conference leading 52.4 points per game and 35.8 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“Defense is our identity, so like always for us, we have to play defense and get stops,” Aguirre said.</p>\n<p>The final step in defense is rebounding and Santa Barbara ranks first in the Big West in rebounding defense, holding its opponents to 32.5 boards per game, which will be especially important against the Aztecs, which typically grab 41 rebounds per game. In addition, if UCSB can keep SDSU off the boards, they will likely be able to shut down 6’6’’ senior center Malia Nahinu, who averages nearly eight points per game off of rebound putbacks.</p>\n<p>“Watching film of them, Fresno State didn’t have anyone at [Nahinu’s] size and they were able to push her away from the basket,” Mitchell said. “She’ll get a lot of points if you don’t block her out on rebound putbacks, but she’s a different type of player than Schlemer. And we’ve seen 6-6 throughout the year.”</p>\n<p>Offensively for the Gauchos, senior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team, averaging 11.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per game. She also shoots 48.3 percent from the field. In the backcourt, Nesbit paces the team, averaging 10.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB shoots 40.2 percent from the field, but struggled to make easy shots against Cal Poly. However, the Gauchos are best when they can get out, run and make some easy baskets in transition.</p>\n<p>“We need to make them have to work in transition defense and we’ve seen from day one that most of the time our easy baskets come in transition if we have an attack mentality,” Mitchell said. “That will be the main thing and then you have to knock down shots. At some point, if you have 12 and 15 foot jumpers, you have to be willing and confident enough to step up and knock them down.”</p>\n<p>The WNIT Tournament is composed of 64 Division I teams and is single elimination. The first round begins tomorrow and will conclude Friday.</p>\n<p>Tipoff against San Diego State is set for 4 p.m. at Viejas Arena.</p>\n<p><em> This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-19/ucsb-travels-to-sdsu-for-wnit-tournament/","id":625,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[624,623,622],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Heading to the Honda Center","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Winning its 14th straight game over Cal State Northridge could not have come at a better time for the UCSB women’s basketball team.

It’s a ‘W’ and that’s all you can ask for.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara improves to 16-15 overall and 3-0 against Northridge on the season while the Matadors finish their season at 16-16 overall.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos were their two All-Big West selections in senior forward Sweets Underwood and junior guard Nicole Nesbit. Underwood recorded a game-high 16 points and nine rebounds while Nesbit tallied 12 points on 6-9 shooting and a team-high three assists.</p>\n<p>“Sweets has done an amazing job all year long of being calm and being very consistent in her play,” Mitchell said. “She’s a senior, she wants to keep her season alive and she stepped up and made big plays.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the team in the first half, scoring eight of her 12 points in the opening period. Back-to-back jumpers from Nesbit capped off an 8-1 from UCSB to give the team a 12-5 lead early in the game.</p>\n<p>From there, the first half became a defensive stalemate, as one might expect from the top two defensive teams in the Big West. After a five minute scoring drought for both teams, the Gauchos finally grabbed the momentum, ending the half on a 6-0 run to take a 22-13 lead into the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>“I think we started attacking more,” Underwood said. “In that last timeout, Coach Mitch emphasized to us that transition is our best offense, so we had to get to the paint and attack them — try to score as many points in the paint as we could.”</p>\n<p>Northridge’s 13 points ties for fifth in the UCSB record book for fewest points by an opponent in a first half.</p>\n<p>“When I walked into the locker room, I went crazy on the team, even though everyone thinks I’m really calm most of the time,” Mitchell said. “When I huddled them up for the second half, I told them, ‘you’re right. You know I’m crazy, but you just held a team to 13 points.’ And 13 just happens to be my lucky number.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s didn’t let go of its lead in the second half as the Matadors were unable to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to fewer than seven points.</p>\n<p>“We always stress the first four minutes of each half to set the tone,” Nesbit said. “When we came out in the second half, we knew that we just needed to keep our lead going and extend it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did in fact continue to build on their lead. Beginning with two free throws from Underwood after an intentional foul call on Northridge, Underwood caught fire, scoring eight straight points to give UCSB its largest lead of the game at 41-25 with just under five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a physical game, but a key part of our team is mental toughness,” Underwood said. “Our motto is, ‘don’t let anything hold you back,’ so it’s just about brushing it off, even if you get fouled on the shot. It’s always the next play and the next shot you have.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, Santa Barbara held Northridge to 31 points on 24 percent shooting, including 0-12 from three-point range. UCSB becomes the only team this season to shutout the Matadors from behind the arc this season. The Gauchos also outrebounded the Matadors 37-29.</p>\n<p>“They did a great job [defensively],” Mitchell said. “We worked extremely hard on defensive end. This time of the year, hopefully it wins you some games.”</p>\n<p>Winning in the Bren Events Center, the same arena where the playoff run began one year ago and resulted in a Big West Championship for UCSB, the Gauchos enter the semifinals tomorrow with momentum. However, they know that it’s a new year and will have to overcome a Cal Poly team they have yet to beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s March Madness,” Nesbit said. “We know what we’re capable of looking at last year, but this year is a completely different year. We have our goals set, and we’re trying to achieve them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off tomorrow is set for approximately 2:30 p.m. at the Honda Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-14/ucsb-heading-to-the-honda-center/","id":626,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[625,624,623],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
