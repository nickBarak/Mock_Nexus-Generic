As UCSB is desperate to win at home, Fullerton might be the perfect opponent considering that the Titans are 1-6 on the road.</p>\n<p>“[At home], it’s not just basketball,” Mitchell said. “They’re still going to class, they’re around their friends and they have family in the stands. Is that added pressure? It shouldn’t be, but it’s like missing one free throw. It’s contagious and now we have an epidemic that we are continuing to battle at home. If you’ve seen us play on the road to watching us play on the road, we’re a totally different team.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also lost last night, falling in a 78-40 blowout against Cal Poly. It was the fourth straight loss for the Titans, who currently stand at 3-5 in conference and 7-13 overall.</p>\n<p>Like Riverside, Fullerton is led by its guards. Sophomore guard Chante Miles paces the team offensively with 12.4 points per game, which ranks ninth in the Big West. She also averages 3.5 assists per game and 2.6 steals per contest, good enough for fifth and third in the league, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton’s tough,” Mitchell said. “They have lightning quick guards, a lot like Riverside. And they’re going to play us a combination of pressure man-to-man and 2-3 zone. So it’ll be close to what we saw tonight (against Riverside).”</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB was unable to handle the defensive pressure. The Gauchos turned the ball over 17 times compared to the Highlanders’ 12 and points off turnovers favored Riverside 20-6.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it came down to that last possession. I think over the course of the game we made little mistakes that in the end, cost us the game,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We knew that Riverside brings a good defensive presence and it’s about being strong with the ball and making the easy passes and we had a little bit of a tough time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a quick start, taking an early 11-5 lead due to 41.7 percent shooting. However, Riverside went on a 10-0 run sparked by junior center Natasha Hadley as she scored eight points during the run, erasing UCSB’s lead. Santa Barbara would never lead the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Hadley led all scorers with 20 points while also grabbing eight rebounds. She dominated the paint as the Highlanders outscored the Gauchos 22-8 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“[Hadley] shoots the ball extremely high, so a double team at the end of the day’s not even going to affect her,” Mitchell said. “We tried to body her up, but we didn’t have an answer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to climb back into the game and get within four, but a 6-0 by Riverside gave them their largest lead of the game at 41-31 with 5:12 remaining.</p>\n<p>That’s when the Gauchos turned up the intensity. UCSB went on an 8-0 run to close the gap to two points at 43-41 with just under a minute left.</p>\n<p>On the next possession, senior guard Angelei Aguirre came up with the steal. Nesbit drove the ball through the right side of the paint and drew the foul with 13 seconds remaining in the game, sending Santa Barbara’s best free throw shooter and second best in the Big West at 86.2 percent to the line to try to tie the ball game.</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit missed the first free throw. After making the second, the Gauchos were forced to foul senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, the Big West’s best free throw shooter at 86.4 percent. She sunk both, leaving UCSB down three with seven seconds to go.</p>\n<p>Forced to run the full length of the court, the Gauchos were unable to execute offensively and failed to get a shot off, losing 45-42. Riverside improved to 10-9 overall and 3-5 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We were wanting to get the ball into Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “We had a flair screen set up for Nic to come to the top for a shot and the timing was just bad.”</p>\n<p>Along with turnovers, free throws cost Santa Barbara the game. Although UCSB ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, averaging 73.4 percent, the Gauchos shot just 56.3 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a matter of relaxing and knocking them down,” senior Sweets Underwood said., who notched her seventh double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 rebounds. “It’s nothing different. It’s on us at the end of the day.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Fullerton Saturday is set for 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/","id":665,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[664,663,662],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Opens Season With Loss to UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the 2013 season with a tough loss to UCLA.

The number one doubles match saw sophomore Catherine Harrison / sophomore Kyle McPhillips of UCLA defeat senior Kiersten Meehan / Scatliffe of UCSB 6-1. The Gauchos came to play against the Bruins, but the skill level just did not add up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a team, we have been trying to improve our aggressiveness and focus during important points for our matches. We have been doing a lot of specific point play during practice which require a certain amount of shots to be hit in a specific area, which helps with our focus and shot selection tremendously,” Scatliffe said. “We also do drills that are high in intensity and encourage little or no errors for an extended amount of playing time.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos start the season with a loss, they look to bounce back with their home opener this Sunday against San Francisco. The match is set to begin at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div

tough.</p>\n<p>“The upperclassmen have a responsibility to make sure that doesn’t happen with the young kids, because the upperclassmen know it’s a long season and we can only control what we can control,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’ve got to look at it as a staff and as a program and the upperclassmen see it more clearly than the young kids do. It’s about ‘what did we do? What happened?’ When you lose, don’t lose the lesson.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, Santa Barbara will be playing in the annual Hilton Concord Classic tournament on Friday and Saturday, facing two worthy opponents – Saint Mary’s of California and (2-1) and University of Alabama Birmingham (3-0).</p>\n<p>“I’ll start working on Saint Mary’s and I’m going to have to sneak a peek at UAB, because we can’t just turn that over overnight,” Henrickson said. “Some of the stuff they run offensively, both teams play man so that helps us, we’re not having to work on man and zone [defense]. And some of the things that UAB runs, we have defended already. But obviously our primary focus is to get ready for Saint Mary’s because we’ve got our hands full because they’re a really talented team.”</p>\n<p>The first opponent, Saint Mary’s, is coming off a dominating 82-64 home win versus Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Sydney Raggio finessed her way to her second double-double of the season, scoring a game-high 23 points and grabbing a whooping 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>SMC has been an offensively powerful team, winning their last two games after opening up their season with a loss. A pivotal aspect of their wins has been a strong offensive presence in the first quarter, bursting on the court with shot after short, setting the pace for the game and giving themselves a nice lead.</p>\n<p>The Gaels hurdled their way to an early 11-5 lead in the first quarter against the Cougars, and went on a 9-0 run in the first quarter to go up at 11-5 versus the Broncos. They won both games by over 5 points or more.</p>\n<p>“Saint Mary’s is a lot of ball reversals, with at least [probably] two to three on-ball screens –what they run offensively, so we’ve started to look at that already.” Coach Henrickson enlightened.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to keep their foot on the gas against the offensively aggressive home team, being careful not to give up a lead like they did against The Redhawks, or fall behind too early as was the case against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Being that it is a tournament, though, the next opponent on UCSB’s itinerary is another commanding challenger.</p>\n<p>The Blazers, the second UCSB opponent of the event, is coming in hot with a currently undefeated record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The University of Alabama at Birmingham has crushed each of their last three adversaries, winning each game by a large margin of 10 points or more.</p>\n<p>Their most recent faceoff was against the Miles Golden Bears, in which UAB held their foes to only 2 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The home team Blazers utilized a vicious well-adjusted game plan consisting of both intense offense and suffocating defense. They dominated the paint by scoring a notable 40 points to Miles’ 14, while also outrebounding the Golded Bears, 43-to-31.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Rachael Childress was in attack mode, chalking up 14 points to lead the Blazers in scoring.</p>\n<p>UAB has not scored less than 13 points in any quarter in all of their last three games.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will need to make sure they stay firm on defense, hard-hitting on offense, and remain fundamentally sound, in order to overcome the well-rounded force of the Blazers.</p>\n<p>The quick turnaround from one game to another is not something to be taken lightly, but the factor of the unknown is not an issue.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for us is, we know it’s UAB. We know it’s not the winner of UAB or Indiana. It’s good that we know it’s UAB from a prep standpoint, cause to try and prepare for three teams right now, would be difficult for us and challenging, for as young as we are. So, we might sneak in some stuff on Wednesday [at practice] that might be different for us, that we haven’t seen.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, her practices with the Gauchos are very tough, and is where she really pushes her players to see what they can do. She stressed that the disbursement of player minutes and standout bench play is going to be critical throughout the tournament, especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>“It’s about production. Players earn minutes in practice. Our bench has to be ready to produce. We’ve got a strong bench and we’re very confident in that.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the team, along with the offensive woes of Santa Barbara, will all be put to the test this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will first face-off against the Saint Mary Gaels this Friday, Nov. 24. And will then go head-to-head with the UAB Blazers on Saturday, Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>Both games in the tournament will take place in Moraga, California at McKeon Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/","id":663,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[662,661,660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel North for a Pair of Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With just two games separating the second and seventh place teams in the Big West to begin round two of conference play, every game counts.

We were able to handle them at our court, but they’re a very disciplined team.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While typically playing on the road is more difficult, at 5-4, UCSB has actually performed better away from home. However, the Gauchos will be going up against a hot Davis team. Despite losing its last game to UC Irvine, which was previously 0-8, the Aggies have won three of their last four.</p>\n<p>“They’re playing a lot better and they’ll be at home, so it’ll be a different team than what we saw when they were here,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in the Thunderdome, Santa Barbara never trailed, emerging with a dominant 58-43 victory. UCSB held Davis to 11 points at halftime, the fourth fewest points scored by an opponent in the program’s history. Offensively, the Gauchos shot 44.4 percent and tallied 17 assists on their 20 field goals.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Melissa Zornig led UCSB offensively with a career-high 24 points. Shooting 5-9 from three, she helped spread the Aggies’ notorious trapping defense.</p>\n<p>“I think just like any game, I have to go in there with confidence and I want to do whatever I can to help my team,” Zornig said. “So whether that’s outside shots, getting in the gaps, [I’ll do] whatever I have to do.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, Davis leads the Big West in steals with nearly 12 per game, so keeping the turnovers low will be big keys offensively for UCSB. The Gauchos may not score a lot, ranking last in the conference in scoring offense, but they are efficient. The team shoots 40.0 percent from the field, good enough for third in league.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, you can’t turn the ball over,” Mitchell said. “You have to have an attack mentality. If you are on your heels and are just trying to pass it around the perimeter and not allow the posts to get touch or get a piece of the paint, it becomes a long night.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end for Santa Barbara, the Gauchos will need to be wary of the Aggies’ three point shooting as Davis leads the Big West in three point field goals made at 7.4 per contest.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 53.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re keeping it to our basics and what we usually do,” Zornig said. “We’re a huge defensive presence in our conference, so as long as we get it done on defense, we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/gauchos-travel-north-for-a-pair-of-games/","id":664,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[663,662,661],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
