Plastino, EVPLA Paola Dela Cruz, Debbie Fleming and James McKarrell to discuss the deputy’s role in Isla Vista</h2>\n<p><em>DN</em>: Why did you choose to apply for the Community Resource Deputy position?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: It’s not very often in this department that an opportunity is presented to work with such a diverse community … There is a lot going on here and I’ll have an opportunity to come in here and make friendships, build relationships and put a different, more positive light on law enforcement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some skills or characteristics you bring to the position?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: I have dealt with community issues in the past. I’ve mentored. I just like people. I’m a Christian, so I’m an ordained deacon and part of my job as an ordained deacon is to serve … I feel at my best when I’m solving problems as a community member in serving others. So just my willingness to go above and beyond. To not put BAND-AIDs on things but to actually fix the problem is what probably sets me apart.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What plans do you have to address alcohol overconsumption in I.V.?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: Looking above and beyond law enforcement and the court system, I’m more concerned about these young adults coming out here, overconsuming alcohol, because they think it’s the thing to do, which leads to sexual assault, which leads to vandalism, which leads to everything under the sun that we’re facing out here … It’s not just penalties and enforcement; it’s a true education of what overconsumption of alcohol can do and how it can ruin lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: Sexual assault is a major topic of concern for the community. How do you plan to address this issue?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: I am going to educate myself first and become familiar with the culture of Isla Vista and the true problems of what’s causing these sexual assaults … I want to educate people and let them know that there is so much more to the surface of what society has kind of thrown out there for us to believe about victims of sexual assault … No matter what happened up until the point when this survivor was assaulted, it’s not okay for them to be assaulted and it’s not okay for us to put them in a category or make them feel as though being assaulted was their fault in any way, shape or form.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What is the biggest challenge you anticipate facing as CRD and how do you plan to overcome it?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: I think the biggest challenge is going to be trust from both sides … Media can make cops seem as though we’re out to get everyone and sometimes the community they have negative interactions with law enforcement. Me getting with the community and showing them ‘Hey, we’re not what you think we are and we’re here to protect you’ and getting with the cops and saying, ‘I know you care about these people, but you have to understand where they’re coming from and at the end of the day your job is to protect them, and not only protect them, but find ways to help them through whatever problems they’re going through.’ The only way we are going to be able to successfully do that is be patient, listen and work together as a whole to solve whatever community issues are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: How do you plan to effectively communicate with the various members of the I.V. community, including students, long-term residents and low-income Latino families?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: I have to meet with them and I have to hear their concerns and then I can figure out where to go from there … I don’t speak Spanish, however I do have resources and if anybody wants to come forth and talk to me, whether it’s English, Spanish or any other language, I’ll use my resources so we can communicate … Something as small as a language barrier at this point, I will not allow it to stop me from helping a portion of this community that feel as though they have been left out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are you most looking forward to as the CRD?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: It has been a tough few years around here and I’m looking forward to the change … There are dedicated people around here. And they’re hungry. I can see it in their eyes, they’re hungry — they want a change. They want this community to thrive, they want the students to be safe, they want the residents to walk out their front doors and feel a sense of ownership … I think we can affect change in a positive manner. I have no doubt in my mind and I think we will because everybody is ready and we’re all moving in the same direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: Why did you choose a career in law enforcement?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: When I was a kid I lived in the city of Los Angeles and LAPD would often be at my house. I didn’t grow up in an ideal situation … When they were there I felt like nothing in the world could hurt me. And because of the way they handled those situations with integrity and peace … I thought, ‘Man, how can I give back? I want to be just like these guys’ … And it wasn’t to become a cop to run, jump gates and wave my finger at people and tell them how wrong they are. I became a cop to do what I am doing now. To build bridges, strengthen communities and just shed a different light on what it is we do in law enforcement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: Do you plan to live in I.V.?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: No, for two reasons. One is it’s really expensive, and two, my wife wouldn’t dare. She will not commute to work; we already talked about moving closer and she likes her little 10 minute drive. I defer to my wife, because she is the boss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What message would you like to communicate to the I.V. community?</p>\n<p><em>McKarrell</em>: We are doing our best at the sheriff’s department to bridge that gap. We hear them, we know their concerns and at the end of the day if you know anything about us, know that we care and we’re here to serve them. I know it doesn’t seem like it all the time, but we’re only trying to make sure that everyone in the community of Isla Vista gets home safely. We owe that to the community, we owe that to their parents and we owe that to the badge that we wear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"64538\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/new-crd-mckarrell-talks-i-v-community/paola-dela-cruz/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?fit=1821%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1821,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Paola Dela Cruz\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?fit=228%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?fit=888%2C976&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64538 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?resize=438%2C424\" alt=\"Paola Dela Cruz\" width=\"438\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=438%2C424 876w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paola-Dela-Cruz.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=438%2C424 1314w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz</strong></p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What was your first impression of McKarrell?</p>\n<p><em>Dela Cruz</em>: My first impression of him really was, ‘what a friendly man’ … We really want someone who is the friendly face of the Foot Patrol because often times students don’t go to the officers when they need help because they fear that they will get in even more trouble … He’s such a great listener, really a great, great listener, and on the other side of that he is willing to learn and to accept any mistakes that he makes and is willing to have anyone come to him and share with him any articles or any trainings that he should take.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What are some of the key issues facing Isla Vista that you plan to work with McKarrell on?</p>\n<p><em>Dela Cruz</em>: One is sexual assault. And this was brought up during the discussions and some tension did rise. But like I said, his ability to understand that he and the Foot Patrol can be wrong and to realize that changes need to be made to me really speaks positively on behalf of himself and the Foot Patrol … I hope to work with him and really bring out creative and innovative projects that address sexual assault and specifically working with survivors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"64539\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/new-crd-mckarrell-talks-i-v-community/rob-plastino/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?fit=1493%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1493,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 60D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365760289\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rob Plastino\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?fit=764%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64539 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?resize=419%2C532\" alt=\"Rob Plastino\" width=\"419\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=419%2C532 838w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rob-Plastino.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=419%2C532 1257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino</strong></p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What type of training will McKarrell undergo to prepare him for the position?</p>\n<p><em>Plastino</em>: James will be given whatever training he requests, with finances being the only potential obstacle.  He will also have flexibility with his schedule to attend trainings. As an example, last week UCSB offered to send James to Green Dot training on campus this week. We adjusted a few things so James could attend this incredible opportunity to learn sexual violence prevention strategy … We will rely heavily upon the community for input into what they think is needed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: What skills or characteristics set McKarrell apart from the other CRD applicants?</p>\n<p><em>Plastino</em>: James and I have known each other for almost 10 years now … He is someone that can relate to people. He has this ability, I think, because he has a very unique background, has overcome incredible life challenges and genuinely likes people … Each of the four deputies that applied for the position were all great choices. Each brought their unique skills and abilities to the panel, and they all presented well. However, at the end of the testing, the panel chose James based on his creative solutions to the problems in Isla Vista, his willingness to be open to new ideas and his ability to communicate these things effectively.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"64537\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/new-crd-mckarrell-talks-i-v-community/debbie-fleming/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?fit=1523%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1523,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Debbie Fleming\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?fit=190%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?fit=780%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64537 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?resize=407%2C482\" alt=\"Debbie Fleming\" width=\"407\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=407%2C482 814w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Debbie-Fleming.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=407%2C482 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><strong>Senior Associate Dean for Student Life Debbie Fleming</strong></p>\n<p><em>DN</em>: How do you anticipate McKarrell will work with the university administration?</p>\n<p><em>Fleming</em>: They [IVFP] come to major events and meetings that Katya Armistead, who’s the Associate Dean for Student Life … He did say that his schedule is flexible, so that he can work nights. I mean a lot of those meetings in the community happen at night. Our meetings at UCSB will probably be more during the day … He’s not going to be able to be everywhere and stick to 40 hours a week.

He’s going to have to attend to a lot of different needs and sometimes they’re going to be in conflict with one another and I think that is going to be a challenge. But he seems like he’s up for it. I think he has the right kind of approach in terms of his communication skills.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily

gathered at People’s Park in Isla Vista to listen to guest speakers before walking down Sueno Road to the University United Methodist Church. A candlelight vigil was held at the church with speakers and live music in remembrance of the nine lives lost in the Charleston Shooting on June 17 and the six lives lost in I.V. in the events of May 23 last year. Guest speakers included state legislators, city officials and the parents of May 23 victims Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss.</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez and senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said 88 Americans are shot and killed every day with hundreds more wounded in homes, schools, churches, stores and streets.</p>\n<p>“Today we accept that gun violence can happen at any time, any place and to anyone in America,” Martinez said. “It happened to my family and it can happen to yours. I am here today for my son, Christopher, who was shot and killed near here just over a year ago.”</p>\n<p>Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Team Leader Emily Heckman said the purpose of the Sunday’s event was to “lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>“We want to pray together for the safety of our children, for the sorrows and deep compassion for our community and for the wisdom and courage of our elected officials to take the next action,” Heckman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider said America’s collective inability to keep history from repeating itself is “disheartening.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen tragedy unfold again and again,” Schneider said. “The second amendment and common sense legislation that would have prevented a lot of these tragedies by stopping mentally ill and convicted criminals from accessing firearms are not mutually exclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson said she remembers the assassinations of Former President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and has not seen significant improvement in gun regulation since.</p>\n<p>“This was decades ago,” Jackson said. “I am very old, and this problem is not getting better.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64216\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"896488250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64225\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64216\" data-attachment-id=\"64216\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-29/walk-church-service-promote-anti-gun-violence-movement/charlestonwalk_by-lorenzo-basilio-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1435502118\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"95\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CharlestonWalk_by Lorenzo Basilio-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64216\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Jackson, acts of violence related to firearm use can be avoided.</p>\n<p>“We talk about mental illness, we talk about hate,” Jackson said. “These are things that live in all societies. But they don’t get to demonstrate themselves the way they do in our country because not everybody has access to a firearm just because they want one.”</p>\n<p>According to Assemblymember Das Williams, gun violence is one of the biggest causes of death among young people in America, behind car accidents and overdoses.</p>\n<p>“We need to, more than anything, keep ourselves and our society from complacency,” Williams said. “If we really want to keep our youth safe, we need to tackle the issues of gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said opponents to increased gun regulation told him background checks did not save his son.</p>\n<p>“Does that mean background checks are a failure and not worth doing? No,” Martinez said. “Seat belts in cars don’t prevent death from accidents 100 percent of the time, but that doesn’t mean we should stop using them. Seat belts save a significant number of lives … We need to improve California’s background check system to prevent the seriously mentally ill from having guns.”</p>\n<p>In the 17 states that require firearm background checks, 46 percent fewer women are shot and killed by their partners, 48 percent fewer on-duty police officers are shot and killed, 48 percent fewer people commit suicide with guns and there is 40 percent less gun trafficking, according to Schneider.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing society can do to reduce gun violence is to require a criminal background check on firearm sale,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, individuals in opposition to gun regulation question why knives are not being focused on because three of the victims of the events of May 23 last year died of knife injuries. Martinez said a gun has “vastly” more power than any knife.</p>\n<p>“The handgun that killed Veronika Weiss could fire more than 40 bullets in one minute” Martinez said. “At the time the Isla Vista shooter died, he had more than 500 bullets left and his gun could fire as fast as he could pull the trigger.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he co-authored Assembly Bill (AB) 1014 with Assemblymember Nancy Skinner to allow for a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) to be signed by a judge to temporarily prohibit a person from owning, purchasing or possessing firearms if the individual has been proven by law enforcement or a loved one to being a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, we shouldn’t be having mentally unstable people having possession of firearms,” Williams said. “Laura’s law is a powerful tool about incorporating mental illness, and I’m pleased that Santa Barbara is looking into it.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she authored Senate Bill 347 which adds dealing in firearms without a license, petty theft involving a firearm, selling ammunition to someone under 21 and bringing or carrying ammunition onto school grounds to the existing list of misdemeanors prohibiting individuals from being able to purchase or possess a firearm for 10 years.</p>\n<p>“A number of crimes are associated with firearm-related misdemeanors,” Jackson said. “We know these people are more likely to use firearms and we know that we need to take those guns away from them moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Schneider said even though 94 percent of American citizens are in support of gun regulation, special interests groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) are still a big obstacle to passing gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“A large part of the problem is on the national level where special interests groups block any debate to keep politicians bound to some sense of ideological purity,” Schneider said. “When that happens our citizens are not served.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes the Charleston Shooting was clearly an act of hatred.</p>\n<p>“It is flamed by groups who unapologetically feel that they are the only ones who have truth and justice by their side,” Jackson said. “And we know they are wrong, and they should not be able to determine the fates of other people.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64213\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

Interviews led by a panel of three deputies and two community members for the three potential candidates will begin July 23.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Public Safety Director Duncan Calvert said the community members on the panel were not allowed to ask questions, but will be included in the process of choosing the CRD from among the applicants.</p>\n<p>“In creating the questions, we left them vague to allow them to do as much research as they possibly can before attending the interview,” Calvert said. “That really lets us see how their mindset is and how they see policing communities and how it especially ties in with Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said the purpose of the meeting was to develop a general consensus on what qualities are desirable in candidates and to expand on what the CRD position requires to better serve the community.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, I want this conversation to be a part of the larger process of the community resource deputy,” Dela Cruz said. “We want to hear back from what you want from this position so the panel can mention to the candidates that this is what the community needs from you.”</p>\n<p>According to I.V. long-term resident Pegeen Soutar, the CRD officer should be sensitive to the community’s needs. Soutar said an example of this awareness of the uniqueness of I.V. is a case where she saw police officers call in a professional to speak with an intoxicated young man instead of arresting him.</p>\n<p>“You can tell the attitude of the young man changed instantly when he had the chance to talk about his problems,” Soutar said. “And for me, that’s community policing.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said it is up to the community members at these meetings to decide what type of work and how many hours will be dedicated to duties the CRD is responsible for, including attending workshops and trainings.</p>\n<p>“We are the ones who can say, ‘Can you please come to this workshop or this training in diversity?’” Dela Cruz said. “It really is up to us to decide what this individual will be doing in the community.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said due to discrimination laws, the phrase “bilingual preferred” could not be included in the job description because the ability to fluently speak a language is considered a skill.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64315\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64315\" data-attachment-id=\"64315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-20/i-v-community-resource-deputy-search-to-attract-genuine-applicants/crd_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437068625\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CRD_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64315\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x576.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CRD_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I discussed it with [I.V. Foot Patrol] Lieutenant [Rob] Plastino, and that is something you are not allowed to put on,” Dela Cruz said. “But if it came down that — all the candidates had the same amount of experience — and that made one stand out in particular, he would choose that person.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Cooperative Manager Melissa Cohen said the nature of the CRD position will attract applicants who “genuinely” want to help the community and are not just applying for a small salary raise.</p>\n<p>“It takes a certain type of person to even apply for this position,” Cohen said. “I think we can hold hope that there will be people who got into police work because they feel strongly about this. Our lieutenant feels quite strongly about it.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer Chaplain Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he agrees the officers who apply for the CRD position are those who want to improve the community.</p>\n<p>“Those who stepped up to the table are those who want to be here,” Hedges said. “They will definitely take some heat from their coworkers who would not step up for this kind of thing.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes the CRD will make committees and teams to help address different issues in I.V., especially those between students and police.</p>\n<p>“There is a disconnect between students and the police force,” Calvert said. “The more interaction we can get between the two will alleviate a lot of the bad things that happen and will help build a stronger community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

UCSB Lions Club planted trees at the Trigo-Pasado Park on Friday in honor of the victims of last year’s May 23rd Isla Vista mass murder.</p>\n<p>Members of the UCSB campus club planted six fruit trees for the six victims of the murders last spring, along with an inscription inspired by Saint Basil that reads, “A tree is known by its fruit; a person by their deeds. A good deed is never lost; those who sow courtesy reap friendship, and they who plant kindness gather love.” The club, along with other neighboring Lions Clubs, serves the local Goleta and Santa Barbara area through numerous community service activities.</p>\n<p>UCSB Lions Club President and second-year economics and accounting major Shane Sato said the trees are a step toward recovery for the community.</p>\n<p>“We are proud to plant these trees in remembrances of those we lost in the tragic event in hopes that growth and healing are also planted into the hearts of our Isla Vista community,” Sato said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sato said the idea came primarily from Mitch Grimes, a fourth-year communication major and the Fundraising Officer for the club.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a good idea because Mitch’s dad owns a landscaping company and he’s also in the Lions Club in Pleasanton in Nor Cal,” Sato said. “He thought it would be a good idea if they donated some trees for us.”</p>\n<p>Sato and Grimes said planning for the event began in the winter when they sorted out the necessary logistical steps to proceed with the project.</p>\n<p>“We started planning four months ago trying to get all the trees,” Grimes said. “I think the [Trigo-Pasado] park is a pretty popular location in the middle of I.V. that a lot of people see.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62616\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62616\" data-attachment-id=\"62616\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-21/club-plants-trees-in-memoriam/tree-planting-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tree planting 6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62616\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?resize=600%2C450\" alt=\"tree planting 6\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tree-planting-6.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62616\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Shane Sato.</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Sato, the organization looks to help with more local events while working with other Lions Clubs from the International organization.</p>\n<p>“We work a lot with the neighboring Lions Clubs, like Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Ventura,” Sato said. “We’ve done blood donations, a multiple sclerosis event, and a veteran’s marathon.”</p>\n<p>Cabinet Treasurer of the Santa Barbara Lions Club Howard Hudson, the “Guiding Lion” and sponsor for the club, said he also oversees and provides support to the local UCSB club.</p>\n<p>“We’re giving them the guidance; we provided them with initial supplies and we’ll continue to give them guidance for the next couple years until they’re really on their feet,” Hudson said. “The UCSB club is going to be focusing on the Goleta and Isla Vista area but they will also be involving themselves with Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
