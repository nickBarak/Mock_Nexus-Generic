But in a new deal with Hawaii County, made on Dec. 26, protestors have instead agreed to move aside and unblock the access road, Hawaii News Now reported. The protestors will still remain at the site.</p>\n<p>Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said in a letter to protesters that “there will be no attempt to deliver construction equipment to Maunakea anytime soon.” Additionally, he added that “State and County agencies and law enforcement agencies will agree to stand down… there will be no attempt to remove [the] protector’s encampment.”</p>\n<p>The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians who claim it is desecrating Mauna Kea, believed to be one of the most sacred areas in all of Hawaii, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p>\n<p>The decision to halt construction came from the TMT International Observatory LLC (TMT) over safety concerns for workers and protestors, according to a statement from Gordon Squires, vice president for external relations for TMT.</p>\n<p>“The state and Hawaii County have not demonstrated that they are able to provide safe, sustained access to Maunakea for everyone,” Squire said. In the past six months alone, the Hawaiian Government has spent over $15 million on law enforcement for the site, the Star Advisor reported.</p>\n<p>Squire also noted that the organization is taking opposition to its project into account.</p>\n<p>“We are sensitive to the ongoing struggles of indigenous populations around the world, and we will continue to support conversations around TMT and the larger issues for which it has become a flashpoint,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Yang currently chairs the Thirty Meter Telescope’s board of governors, and his involvement faced backlash over the summer from students who opposed the project.</p>\n<p>In September, the UC Student Association (UCSA), which is comprised of every UC student government, wrote a letter opposing the telescope and the UC’s involvement in the project.</p>\n<p>In December, UCSB’s Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and the American Indian Student Association (AISA) brought Native Hawaiian protestors to campus to discuss their opposition to the project and urge students to support their cause.</p>\n<p>Despite the announcement about pausing TMT’s construction, Hawaiian elders and protest leaders said they were skeptical about TMT’s decision to pause construction after initially being given a deadline to vacate the area, according to the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>“[Governor Ige] making an obtuse statement that TMT has announced that they’re not coming for a while just doesn’t hold any water for us,” Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, a protest leader, told the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>Daevionne Beasley, the EVPSA of UCSB’s Associated Students, called the new announcements a “ploy” to remove protestors from Mauna Kea and clear the area for construction to resume.</p>\n<p>“When I had first heard [TMT was] halting the construction, I thought it was a good idea,” Beasley said, who has previously spoken to Yang about his involvement with TMT and is a co-signer of the UCSA letter.</p>\n<p>But combined with the fact that protesters have to move their tents to the side of the access road, Beasley believes “the government is trying to push [protesters] out so that [TMT is] able to go in and resume construction whenever they see fit.”</p>\n<p>Beasley also believes the protesters’ biggest point of contention with TMT — its location on historically sacred land — can be remedied by breaking ground in a new location that doesn’t impose on “someone else’s indigeneous land.”</p>\n<p>“The only solution in my head is to pause all development on the telescope until science is able to advance where [TMT doesn’t] have to build a telescope in an area where it would affect indigenous people,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He said that he attracted users over to the new subreddit by simply telling people on the current page to come transfer over, promising a better moderator presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, Boe worked in a team of three, including UCSB alumni u/beetling and u/Rlight. The team has worked hard to make the page “a place for inclusion” — where r/UCSantaBarbara members could come together and help one another, according to Boe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, that “place of inclusion” has grown substantially. In the last eight years, the number of submissions to the page has grown by nearly 500%, according to a post detailing the number of annual submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the page has become so popular that Boe and his team have found it hard to maintain the vast community on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been rather amazing watching this subreddit grow from an initial 50 to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers. However, lately, we’ve noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we’d prefer,” Boe detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the page’s growth, Boe posted a callout to the Reddit community in November, encouraging UCSB students to apply to become a new moderator and work alongside the current group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the callout was posted, Boe announced in a later post that month that two new moderators, fourth-year pharmacology major u/thejappster and third-year biological science major u/swimming_legend, had been selected. Both new moderators asked to be referred to only by their usernames, citing privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boe said the two new moderators stood out in the selection process because they were some of the most active people on the page. Their post history met Boe’s and u/beetling’s standards for the position and they both appeared to be students who genuinely cared about the UCSB Reddit community, Boe added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/thejappster said he used the subreddit to help him navigate his time at UCSB — researching classes, asking for advice and staying up to date on news in the community. As a new moderator, he said his focus is on promoting healthy discussion on a wide variety of topics, like local events and what professors or classes to take, and to encourage people with different views to express their opinions, as long as they are not attacking each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can get tricky in stressful situations, such as when the Thomas Fire occurred near campus three years ago. The stress of the situation led to an influx of content and information that was difficult to aggregate, u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, u/thejappster said the subreddit was meaningful to him because of the people who engage with it since they are often students, alumni or people who just live in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They really care about the subreddit and really care about helping people,” u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/swimming_legend joined the sub his first year at UCSB and said he hasn’t regretted it for a second. He said he uses the page for academic advice, social connections and a good laugh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although u/swimming_legend said he has not been a member of the Reddit page as long as the other moderators, he felt proud to have been “a member of a community that … has a positive impact on its members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said he is excited to implement new ideas for the page and create a more friendly and helpful experience for its users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new moderator team has already hit the ground running; u/swimming_legend said they are working on a new way to improve the design of the page and make it more user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important change that the team is working on, according to u/thejappster, is a way to consolidate all the posts about social groups — such as people who are looking for a group to hang out with in real life. That way people looking to make real friends or who are feeling lonely have a place to meet others in similar situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the team’s main focus has been around establishing a syllabus bank, which officially launched on Jan. 5, according to an </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ekf9et/syllabus_bank_new_for_winter_2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement on Reddit.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to u/thejappster, the bank is a resource where “users submit syllabi to an online database, like Google Drive and you post that link to the Reddit page.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current and forthcoming improvements to the Reddit page are not only for the benefit of the sub itself but also for the students’ lives, as they use the page as a resource for all things UCSB, Boe stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, having two current students as moderators will also help to better represent the current student perspective at UCSB, Boe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are the ones who have the opportunity and the time to put into making the community better.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correction [Jan. 17, 12:38 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Boe was the head moderator of r/UCSantaBarbara, that he maintained the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has three members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article has been corrected to reflect that r/UCSantaBarbara has no official head moderator, that Boe did not maintain the page by himself and that the current team of moderators has four members. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quotation that contradicted Boe’s statement regarding the moderators’ ideas for the Reddit page has also been removed. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/downvote-the-old-upvote-the-new-r-ucsantabarbara-grows-in-community-members/","id":3351,"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay"},"related":[3350,3349,3348],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"C.A.P.S.

He shared their annual report with me and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to do this.’ And that’s been my goal from when I started here,” Olowude said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Olowude said C.A.P.S. has been organizing its data — gathered in Excel sheets —  and consolidating it with other universities in the UC system, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of work [in the] unification of our data to make sure that what I’m calling something, someone on another campus is also calling it [the same thing],” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterns revealed in the data collected will allow C.A.P.S. to pinpoint the cause of any dips in the number of visits, Olowude said. The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families. Well, when they’re here, they don’t have to and it’s confidential,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these students in particular, C.A.P.S. created the position of assistant director of Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion. The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing. I’m very proud of the staff that we’ve been able to compile that work here. And I’m very humbled by and honored by the respect and the support our students have given us,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the January 16, 2018 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
