But sometimes, feet have to be held to the fire and burned to a crisp instead. That’s where the Golden Raspberry Awards come in.</p>\n<p>An antithesis of the Oscars, the Razzies give out awards to films that are considered the worst of the year. The award itself is a cheap, plastic trophy of a raspberry sitting on a film reel, spray-painted gold. It’s a lighthearted reflection of the effort put into some of the films being “honored.” Past winners include Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Ashton Kutcher, Sandra Bullock, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan.</p>\n<p>This year, the most awards went to Kirk Cameron and his film “Saving Christmas.” One of the more recent films of the 2014 strain of Christian propaganda movies, “Saving Christmas” was an ego project of Cameron’s. His character (named Kirk) attempts to (incorrectly) convince his brother-in-law Christian (really?) that the origins of Christmas can actually be traced back to the Bible, as opposed to pagan traditions. The film was so universally reviled that it now holds the distinction of being the lowest-rated film on IMDB. The movie won Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actor (for Cameron) and Worst Screen Couple awards. That last one was awarded by the Golden Raspberry Foundation to “Kirk Cameron and his ego.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5-yA66kaVc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>The Worst Actress award was given to Cameron Diaz for her performances in the “John Tucker Must Die” rip-off “The Other Woman” and the ironically safe “Sex Tape.”</p>\n<p>Frasier Crane himself, Kelsey Grammer won Worst Supporting Actor for his performances in “The Expendables 3,” “Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return,” “Think Like a Man Too” and “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”</p>\n<p>In a move that pretty much everybody saw coming, Megan Fox won Worst Supporting Actress for portraying April O’Neil in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” a role that nobody thought she was suited for. She probably only got it so that Michael Bay could continue to leer at her.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Bay, the director won his second Razzie for “Transformers: Age of Extinction.” He received his first for “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.” However, credit must be given where it is due. Despite the fact that many people think Michael Bay films are about as enjoyable as having toddlers high on sugar scream in your ears, he still manages to extort as much money from low-standard-holding cinemagoers as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>And just to get it out of the way (because I am sure none of you saw this film) “Annie,” starring Quvenzhane Wallis, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz won Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel.</p>\n<p>This year, a special category was introduced: the Razzie Redeemer Award, which was created with the intention of genuinely honoring past Razzie winners who have managed to turn their careers around. The winner was Ben Affleck for “Gone Girl.” Affleck redeemed himself from “Gigli,” a film that currently sits on Wikipedia’s list of “film’s considered the worst.”</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung is disappointed that “The Legend of Hercules” escaped an award.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61218\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/kirk-cameron-and-more-honored-at-35th-golden-raspberry-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61218\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/kirk-cameron-and-more-honored-at-35th-golden-raspberry-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/kirk-cameron-and-more-honored-at-35th-golden-raspberry-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/kirk-cameron-and-more-honored-at-35th-golden-raspberry-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/kirk-cameron-and-more-honored-at-35th-golden-raspberry-awards/","id":5940,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5939,5938,5937],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Talent Trade Conference Shares Industry Secrets with Aspiring Actors, Screenwriters","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Talent-Trade-by-Lauren-Mercier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Talent-Trade-by-Lauren-Mercier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“That Ari Gold character is tame compared to [agents in] the CAA,” said Justin Winters, a screenwriter who has been around the block when it comes to talent agencies.

Winters delivered this one-liner during UCSB’s sixth annual Talent Trade, which took place March 7-8. The two-day conference featured talent industry professionals who discussed where they have been and how they got there. From learning how to brand oneself to finding the right agency, a wealth of knowledge filtered through a room on the fourth floor of the SSMS building.</p>\n<p>Like Winters, most of the panelists were former Gauchos. According to Talent Trade’s organizer Danielle Hakimi, alumni were the contacts who confirmed the quickest interest.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain pride that comes with it — [Alums think] ‘I’m graduated, and now I’m successful,’” Hakimi said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hakimi directs the purposely lower-cased “mab productions,” an organization which produces events and shows with the hopes of bridging UCSB’s film and theater departments. A third-year theater major, Hakimi is optimistic about mab’s role as a liaison.</p>\n<p>“[The theater department] has actors, designers, directors, people interested in writing and producing. People in the film department make films, look for actors, look for all these people who are five minutes away from them,” Hakimi said.</p>\n<p>Mab productions inherited the Talent Trade conference this year and made it a primary goal to meld together people from both departments. The final group was small — around 25 members — but the smallness allowed students to deeply connect with panelists. Casual networking occurred throughout the weekend, creating what Hakimi calls “a genuine connection.”</p>\n<p>While each session brought its own share of guidance, the agents’ workshop offered tons of practical advice. Here’s a choice selection of tips given by former-gauchos-turned-agents Sarah Agronow, Jackson Gibbon and Winters.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Becoming an actor: Get on Vine and YouTube. Tom Spriggs, a talent manager/producer who was also on the Talent Trade roster, scans YouTube on a daily basis for talent. The main draw is that successful videos already have a following and are marketable to a concrete number. Scrolling through YouTube led Spriggs to finding “Bath Boys,” a comedy group who has since then started doing movies.</li>\n<li>Moving to L.A.: Pick an apartment in Hollywood, Silver Lake or Culver City so you do not have to meander too far from the scene. Three months is the quickest anyone gets a real job, so be prepared for the starving artist life and eating Top Ramen every night.</li>\n<li>Making rent money: Work as a extra in a film or TV show for around $80 a day, or serve in a clap audience for TV sitcoms. Winters was an excellent clapper.</li>\n<li>Finding an agent: Get the phone number of your mom’s best friend’s nephew who has a friend with a brother who works for an agency. Contact them and offer to buy them coffee. Whatever you do, do not solicit at agency front desks and hand random people your headshots. Agronow works at a boutique agency that serves Danny Trejo (“Machete”) and throws lots of headshots away. Occasionally, she will save the funny ones — like man with Chet Faker facial hair and bowtie — to show at seminars like Talent Trade.</li>\n<li>Making an agent like you: Befriend their assistant, because they have all the power. As an agent assistant, Winters handpicked everyone his boss looked at. To get through the first line of defense, buy the assistant coffee and be extraordinarily courteous on the phone.</li>\n<li>Getting a job: Realize that cherry picking is a thing, and figure out your brand, aka that special thing that makes you marketable. Winters told a story about how the man who wrote “The Pirates of the Caribbean” branded himself as “the pirate guy” for several years before the multi-billion-dollar franchise got picked up.</li>\n<li>Getting another job: Gibbon recommended being easy to work with at your first job so that producers will recommend you for another gig. This means coming in on time, knowing your lines and avoiding on-set substance abuse. Apparently Tom Sizemore (“Black Hawk Down”) brought prostitutes to the set and would be engulfed with baking soda in the bathroom for hours. Don’t be that actor.</li>\n<li>Writing a screenplay: Carry a notebook, always. Winters advised to outline ideas fully until you nail the plotline and have an ending.</li>\n<li>Hating L.A. traffic: The general consensus was that L.A. traffic is terrible and will always be terrible, so find podcasts that you love and form a relationship with your car. Winters is always the only one laughing hysterically on the 405 while everyone else sulks into boredom and anger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it was an agents’ panel, advice on how to become Ari Gold from “Entourage” was included in the discussion. The main thing to know is that it is a holistically strenuous job. Winters reported that a lead agent at Innovative smashed cell phones with a hammer, while Gibbon ensured that angry spats are “99 percent about them, not about you.”</p>\n<p>The alphabet soup of top agencies to work for was poured out: CAA, UTA and WME. Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is the most prestigious of them all and has weird agent rules like no cell phone use when you’re a freshman. (Hence hammer-smashing). United Talent Agency (UTA) specializes in hot, new talent so they are a solid base for newbie actors. William Morris Endeavor (WME) is the largest agency in the world and supports giants like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amount of celebrity name-dropping that occurred throughout Talent Trade, the conference was largely a casual experience. Panelists talked to attendees without PowerPoint or rehearsed dialogue. Attendees left dry-cleaned slacks at home and wore faded jeans and hooded sweatshirts. Sandwich lunches complete with juice and granola bars were shared amongst everyone. The air of informality was crisp and non-threatening.</p>\n<p>And yet, the informality made the conference all the better. Things didn’t get overcomplicated with resumes or dress code, and the casual attitude everyone held brought genuine connections throughout the weekend. The workshops were a bit ragtag at times, but all in all everyone walked out armed with ideas on how to join the Talent Industry after college.</p>\n<p>In addition to Talent Trade, the Film and Media Dept. has a large repertoire of events such as Word Farm, Reel Loud, Cam Con and the Digital Film Festival.

On April 16, UCSB’s Girl Up Club hosted a screening of the internationally acclaimed film “It’s a Girl” in the Student Resource Building’s Multipurpose Room.</p>\n<p>Students filed in as the smell of buttery popcorn and the sound of snapping soda cans filled the room. The abundance of junk food would be a temporary comfort to those unprepared for the harsh reality that would be shared by the movie.</p>\n<p>Directed by Evan Grae Davis, “It’s a Girl” introduced a widespread custom called “gendercide” that is globally practiced but often unheard of. The documentary told intriguing stories of abandoned and trafficked girls, of families who would kill for a son and of women who must fight to save their daughters. Through interviews and animations, the film’s team attempted to accurately capture the war that is continuously waged against girls in traditional societies across the world.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Located and shot in India and China, director Davis and producer Andrew Brown interviewed victims.

Davis also spoke to activists such as Reggie Littlejohn, who is president and founder of an organization called Women’s Rights Without Frontiers. In between interview segments, animator Garrett Moldrem heightened victims’ stories with simple yet gripping graphics that emulated each narrative.</p>\n<p>Despite the film’s imperfect edits, viewers were taken by the holistic message: gendercide is not only worldwide and unjust but, most importantly, must be ended.</p>\n<p>Since its release in September 2012, “It’s a Girl” has been screened in hundreds of settings and has engaged close to a million people. The film has acted as a tool for schools and organizations to enlist people, from students to influential leaders, in the battle against gendercide.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Girl Up is working towards publicizing issues such as gendercide that negatively and internationally impact women and girls. Vice President of UCSB’s Girl Up Club Claudia Perez said, “It’s incredibly important to, as the film itself stated, ‘fight for our sisters’ because they so often can’t fight for themselves.” The club hopes to host more screenings in the future. “It all starts by showing powerful [documentaries like this],” Perez explained; in addition to other events that will promote change within and beyond the UCSB community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Facebook: UC Santa Barbara Girl Up</p>\n<p>Instagram: ucsbgirlup</p>\n<p>Find out more about Girl Up at <em><a href=\"http://www.girlup.org\">girlup.org</a> </em></p>\n<p>Find out more about the documentary at <em><a href=\"http://www.itsagirlmovie.com\">itsagirlmovie.com</a> </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62597\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/200-million-girls-are-missing-ucsbs-girl-up-club-hosts-its-a-girl-documentary-screening/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62597\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/200-million-girls-are-missing-ucsbs-girl-up-club-hosts-its-a-girl-documentary-screening/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/200-million-girls-are-missing-ucsbs-girl-up-club-hosts-its-a-girl-documentary-screening/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/200-million-girls-are-missing-ucsbs-girl-up-club-hosts-its-a-girl-documentary-screening/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-20/200-million-girls-are-missing-ucsbs-girl-up-club-hosts-its-a-girl-documentary-screening/","id":5938,"author":{"id":754,"name":"Janel Mendoza"},"related":[5937,5936,5935],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Sean Astin Film Barely Scratches “The Surface,” Spoiler Alert!","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wuwm.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wuwm.jpg?resize=646%2C516&ssl=1","description":"The surface of Lake Michigan is tepid, slow and without a hint of danger.

Mitch’s only defining trait is that he’s suicidally depressed because life has been punching him in the gut with weighted gloves. Kelly’s reason for being out on the lake is a criminal problem that solves itself towards the end of the movie, with absolutely zero consequences for either character.</p>\n<p>And the thing about these two guys is that they are not set up particularly well. The movie starts out by beating you over the head about how comically awful Mitch’s life is: his faucet is busted, his mother is in a rest home, the skies are gray and, unlike a nearby jet-ski team, he’s not being covered by Fox News (which is kind of like being sad that the town gossip isn’t paying you enough attention). Then to top it all off, depressing music plays in the background.</p>\n<p>Later, serious reasons for why Mitch wants to die come forth: his girlfriend left him for her “soulmate,” and then she died, and Mitch hired his father to work for him at a warehouse, where his head was crushed into paste by a truck. While this is very sad for Mitch, the scenario quickly starts feeling like overkill; these are too many (and some too over-the-top) reasons to die. It feels unrealistic.</p>\n<p>Then there’s Kelly, whose first response to being rescued is to pull a knife on his rescuer, which isn’t particularly smart when said rescuer has an oar to whack you over the head with. His later-revealed logic for pulling said knife doesn’t make too much sense under the circumstances either. And to top it all off, Kelly outright tells Mitch to commit suicide, which is an outrageously cruel and stupid thing to do.</p>\n<p>What follows is a little over an hour of chit-chat. And it’s actually not bad chit-chat! Some of the conversations are pretty smart and interesting, and make sense under the circumstances. Kelly wants to survive, and Mitch just wants to help this unfortunate man of circumstance.</p>\n<p>Also, I want to commend the filmmakers for having the balls to actually film out on the open water. A retrospective on the making of “Jaws” revealed the difficulty of this task, and making “The Surface” must have been exceptionally tough for the cast and crew. It’s a shame that they didn’t spend as much effort on writing the characters. Did I mention the fact that Kelly’s entire point for even being in this movie is resolved towards the end with absolutely zero consequences for the characters?</p>\n<p>This movie is no “Life of Pi,” or “All is Lost<em>.</em>” In trying to make you sympathize with these characters, the movie hits you over the head with a spiked mallet and screams “FEEL BAD FOR THEM!” simultaneously. I don’t know about you, but I’m not a fan of being hit over the head. When the entire premise of your film is two guys are stuck on Lake Michigan, and those two characters aren’t written all that well, the experience becomes grating. The only time I ever got emotional during this movie was when I found out via the credits that the cute little wiener dog with only two legs that played Kelly’s pet has since died.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to plead to Sean Astin not to send Gollum after him for writing this review.
