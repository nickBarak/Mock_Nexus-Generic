What it doesn’t show is how close the game was.</p>\n<p>After trailing the entire first half, UCSB took its first lead of the game with 18:49 to play. While Santa Barbara wouldn’t trail for the remainder of the night, the game then seesawed back and forth as no team could pull away.</p>\n<p>With a minute to go, a one-point lead and the ball, senior guard Nicole Nesbit drove and missed. Senior guard Destini Mason grabbed the offensive board, earning another possession. The second-chance basket missed again for Santa Barbara, but Mason brought down another offensive board and this time was fouled. Nevertheless, she missed both free throws, opening the door for the Broncos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, Santa Clara couldn’t take advantage, turning the ball over on a three second violation. With 17.3 seconds remaining on the clock, the Broncos almost came up with the steal, tipping the ball out of bounds. On the second chance, UCSB was forced to call a timeout, unable to inbound the ball.</p>\n<p>“We had a press set that should’ve given us three options, but they did a good job of denying Nic,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Then, we went to trying to have Destini get open as well, but they had a lot of pressure on the ball. They had 6’4’’ on the ball, so it had to be a bounce pass to get the ball inbounds.”</p>\n<p>On the third shot, the Gauchos successfully inbounded to Nesbit, the team’s top free throw shooter, who went 4-4 from the free throw line down the stretch to ice the game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done this hundreds and hundreds of times, probably thousands,” Nesbit said. “You can’t worry about the atmosphere; nothing’s different about it.”</p>\n<p>The win snaps a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos as they improve to 2-2. With the loss, Santa Clara falls to 0-4.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely exciting to get that first road win,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We came in there upset from the last game (against St. Mary’s) and we went in there to fight tonight. We really wanted to win the game, so we went out with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s seniors took the reins in earning their team its first road victory, combining for 50 of the Gauchos’ 67 points. Nesbit, Zornig and Mason finished with 19, 18 and 13 points, respectively. Mason also tallied 10 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors stepped up and made critical plays,” Mitchell said. “They didn’t shoot it the best, but Mel found ways to get to the free throw line, Destini got crucial second-chance opportunities late in the game and Nic was able to keep the ball and knock down big free throws late.”</p>\n<p>The biggest difference for the Gauchos was in the turnover category. UCSB turned the ball over just nine times, compared to Santa Clara’s 21 giveaways, leading to 26-6 advantage in points off turnovers. UCSB was also able to contain Santa Clara’s height inside, limiting their two 6’4’’ players to 14 combined points.</p>\n<p>“We stress our defense,” Nesbit said. “We knew going into this game they had a couple legit 6’4’’ players, so we knew we were going to have to full front. You can’t play behind them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Hampton tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily

game out of first place in the Summitt League and made it to the quarter finals in their conference tournament before getting upset by Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>In comparison, UCSB only finished 6-22 last year and came in dead last in the Big West, making it the only team to not qualify for the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time the team missed the conference tournament since 1998.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Pasternack and fans alike, the team has changed drastically from last year both in terms of new players and just being healthy.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest storylines this year is going to be the return of senior guard Gabe Vincent, who consistently has been the team’s best player since he arrived three years ago.</p>\n<p>How he responds to coming back from a season-ending injury remains to be seen, but the production of the team is definitely going to be linked with his production.</p>\n<p>Last year Vincent led the team in points (295) and points per game (14.8) at the end of the season, even though he missed the last eight games. Despite coming back from injury, the media surrounding the Big West conference still respects Vincent’s game, as he was one of the six athletes named to the All-Big West Preseason Team.</p>\n<p>While he will be better equipped to maintain a high usage rate this year, one of the main focuses of the team is going to have to be looking for increased offensive production from other players to provide a supporting cast.</p>\n<p>Both of the new offseason graduate pickups, Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, will play an integral role in making this happen.</p>\n<p>During King II’s two years at Brown, he averaged 14.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, and while his numbers did drop his last year with Nevada, if he can get them at least closer to what they used to be, he will be a big boost to the Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>While the forward wasn’t able to provide any scoring in his exhibition game debut going 0-4 from the field in 13 minutes of play, he did rebound well finishing with four, second most for the Gauchos, and defended hard.</p>\n<p>What he lacked offensively was picked up by the other transfer, Marcus Jackson, who scored 14 points on 6-11 shooting in his first game with UCSB.</p>\n<p>Jackson has already played a decorated career at Rice, where he made the second most three-pointers in school history and scored over 1,000 points.</p>\n<p>Adding another veteran presence to the starting lineup will certainly help communication, something that a team that last year ranked in the bottom half of the league in three-pointers given up, points given up and opponent field-goal percentage desperately needs.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Gauchos’ opponent on Saturday, it seems that the bulk of the game plan defensively for UCSB is going to be focused on senior guard Paul Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller led the Bison in three-pointers made (74) and both scoring (501) and points per game (16.7) last year.</p>\n<p>He tallied five assists in NDSU’s exhibition win against Concordia-Moorhead this year and, along with the rest of the Bison offense that scored 74.8 points per game last year, should offer a good first test for the Gaucho defense.</p>\n<p>Miller was also voted to the preseason All-Summit League First Team for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Another notable returner will be senior combo guard/forward A.J. Jacobson, who shot better than 40 percent from downtown last season and has already tallied over 1,000 points as a Bison, becoming the 33rd in history to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>Unlike last Saturday, the match this weekend will count in all facets, including the team’s record, Pasternack’s overall record and, most importantly, how the fans will see this team.</p>\n<p>For a mid-major program, home crowds are everything, which is something Pasternack has routinely expressed. Wins play a huge factor in that role.<br>\nUCSB faces off against North Dakota State at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 11 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

We know we’re at and that we can hang with the Pac-12. It’s just a conference.”</p>\n<p>The most critical error for UCSB was in the rebounding column. The Wildcats outrebounded the Gauchos 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half, grabbing critical offensive rebounds that gave Arizona extra opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It was different players at different phases of the game and two or three of them were at the free throw line,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “That’s a lack of focus and a lack of discipline. I think our kids will write it across their chests to not let those same mistakes happen.”</p>\n<p>Against top competition, UCSB continued to see consistent production from its three seniors. On the season, Nesbit leads the team, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Mason has tallied 13 points and 5.0 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig has added 5.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“[The seniors are] above and beyond expectations,” Mitchell said. “In year number three, I can communicate with them on a different level. With Nic, Mel and Destini, they’ve been ultimate leaders and a pleasure.”</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, the Gauchos will have to deal with a very tall team. While the average height for Santa Barbara is 5’9’’, the Gaels measure in at an average height of 5’11’’. The defense will especially be tested as starting center senior Carli Rosenthal is 6’3’’.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s also features taller guards, headlined by senior guard Jackie Nared. At 6’1’’, Nared is averaging an incredible 23.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.3 assists, shooting 53.2 percent from the field, including 46.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“The taller guards have been a thorn in our back,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully, we can keep [Nared] out of rhythm and we’ve been doing a better job of pressing this year, so hopefully we can make them speed it up more than their used to and then we don’t have to guard them in the half court.”</p>\n<p>As an offensively minded team, the Gaels have four players averaging double-figures and have tallied 84.3 points in their first three games.</p>\n<p>“They’re tough. They put up 90 [points] just about every night and probably the one stat to me that I don’t know if I’ve ever seen in my 20 years of coaching is 50 free throw attempts against Butler on the road,” Mitchell said. “That just tells me they have an attack mentality. It’s not going to be a finesse game. It’s going to be attack the paint and attack the boards. We’ll definitely have our hands full.”</p>\n<p>Even as a team that likes to push the ball, UCSB has averaged 63.5 points per game. In the season opener, Santa Barbara put 76 points on the scoreboard, tying the second most in the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“We know what we’re capable of on the defensive end. Defense is going to be the main game plan,” Nesbit said. “I think for us, we’ve been scoring more than the past couple seasons, so we know we’re going to get them to play our game and speed it up and see if they can hang with us.”</p>\n<p>Tip off tonight is set for 6 p.m. at McKeon Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/","id":615,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[614,613,612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops First Road Game of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall 89-79 to the Gaels","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has proved itself an offensive force this year, but the Gauchos still couldn’t keep up with the potent offense of St. Mary’s as they fell 89-79 yesterday in their first road game of the season.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara scored the second most points during the Carlene Mitchell era with 79, the 89 points the Gauchos gave up was the most since Mitchell’s arrival to UCSB.

The Gaels were 6-8 from behind the arc and 21-28 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a team shoot 63 percent from the field, so that was rough,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I don’t think we were as sharp as we couldn’t been defensively.”</p>\n<p>The options were plentiful for St. Mary’s on the offensive end as the team ended the night with four players in double figures. Leading the offense were senior guard Kate Gaze and sophomore guard Lauren Nicholson, who on the season only average 11.7 and 10.7 points per game, respectively. However, with Nared on the bench, the guards stepped up, tallying 26 points apiece. Danielle Mauldin also added a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They have balanced scoring, so there’s not just one player that can get it done,” Mitchell said. “You have to give them credit for finding the mismatches and taking advantage of it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos drop to 1-2 overall while the Gaels stay perfect on the year, improving to 4-0.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s powerful offense was evident straight from the tip. Nicolson knocked down consecutive threes and St. Mary’s jumped out to a quick eight point, which was kept rest of half.</p>\n<p>“It was a frustrating game,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We let them get the shots they wanted and they knocked a lot of shots down. We just didn’t get it done defensively.”</p>\n<p>To start the final period, Santa Barbara’s seniors put the team on their backs, scoring UCSB’s first 11 first points of the half to cut St. Mary’s lead to just one point.</p>\n<p>All three seniors for the Gauchos finished in double-figures. Zornig scored 19 points, four steals and a career-high nine assists while Mason also had a career-high setting night. She finished with a personal best 18 points and seven rebounds, breaking the career-high she already broke earlier this season when she scored 16 against Occidental. Finally, consistent as always, senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 17 points.</p>\n<p>“We know the dynamic of the team and we know we have to step it up to another level,” Mason said. “I’m glad Mel got in her rhythm and started knocking down some stuff. We know we have to be on our game because everyone’s following our lead.”</p>\n<p>But St. Mary’s offense was relentless. An 8-0 run a little over halfway through the half gave the Gaels an 11 point cushion, which would be enough to keep the Gauchos at bay the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will continue its road trip Saturday at Santa Clara. Tip-off is set for 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53191\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53191\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/ucsb-drops-first-road-game-of-the-season/","id":616,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[615,614,613],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
