And then Elegado and [senior guard Jonae] Ervin just rotate on who’s going to carry the burden on the offensive end of it. [Ervin] had 37 in Hawaii and Elegado had 30 tonight. That’s tough when you’re trying to play zone and it’s hard to match-up one-on-one with Schlemer on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Schlemer led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting from the field. With 15 rebounds, Schlemer completed her eighth double-double of the season. Fronting, playing behind or trying to stop her in a zone, UCSB had no answer for the 6’5’’ reigning Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Once she’s on the block, she just turns and she finishes,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “She’s very big. We have to make sure we have help-side and be aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Elegado finished the evening with 30 points, six rebounds and five assists, hitting big threes when the Gauchos went into a zone defensively to try to slow down Schlemer. Her 30 points is nearly double her season average of 15.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Overall, while Santa Barbara is known for its defense, it simply was no match for the Mustang’s offense. Overall, Cal Poly outshot UCSB 50.0 percent to 34.3 percent and outscored the Gauchos 46-16 in the paint.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the loss marks the sixth straight defeat to the Mustangs, which improve to 8-7 overall and a perfect 2-0 in the Big West. The Gauchos, on the other hand, drop to 5-9 overall and 0-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“You want to win no matter who you play. I don’t care if it’s Cal Poly or the no-name school from whatever,” Mitchell said. “Our kids are going to compete and it’s game number one of the Big West. That’s what we know.”</p>\n<p>Knocking down threes in the first half, UCSB was able to keep the score close. UCSB was 6-9 from behind the arc in the opening period with Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig both shooting 3-3 from downtown. Mason’s third three of the half brought the score within two at 36-34 with 2:31 to go, but Cal Poly finished the half on a 5-0 run, including a leaning three while on the run from Elegado at the buzzer.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos went ice cold to begin the second half, going 2-14 from the field. With Cal Poly’s offense showing no signs of slowing down, Santa Barbara lost all control of the game and remains winless against the Mustangs during the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“It was within striking distance,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes when kids try too hard, you shoot it short. We missed a lot of easy chippies right in the lane. It wasn’t just three pointers that we were taking. You have to compete and put the ball in the basket when you get open looks and that’s your responsibility.”</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of Mason, who tallied a new career-high for the fourth time this season with 24 points on 10-17 shooting, including 4-5 from three-point range and a team-high six rebounds. Zornig also contributed 18 points.</p>\n<p>“I was just playing free,” Mason said. “If I had a shot, I [took] it and made sure I stayed on the attack. A few threes went down for me, so that was good, but I was just playing how I usually play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will regroup and return to action on the road Thursday against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/","id":573,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[572,571,570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Battle of the Beach Schools","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"First Place UCSB Travels to Hawaii to Take on the Rainbow Warriors","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Road trips are always a time for team bonding and as the UCSB men’s basketball team embarks on its longest road trip of the season this week, the Gauchos must attempt to balance the strains of travel and the lure of a new place when they face Hawaii tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest tied for first place in the Big West with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 record in conference play.

The victories propelled UCSB back into first place after a weekend, which saw them fall to Cal State Fullerton and narrowly escape UC Riverside in overtime.</p>\n<p>“After the loss to Fullerton it was kind of another wake up for us to realize that if we don’t come ready to play each night, teams that may not have the best record can easily come out here and beat us,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos with a pair of monster performances last weekend was junior center Alan Williams. The big man garnered his fourth Big West Player of the Week Award this season after he averaged 26.5 points, 15 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two victories.</p>\n<p>Also of importance was the emotional return of sophomore guard John Green on Saturday against Davis. Green played in his first regular season game as a Gaucho after injuries derailed his collegiate career over the past three years. It will certainly be of interest to see how Green progresses and emerges into Santa Barbara’s rotation of wing players including Boswell, sophomore guard Michael Bryson and sophomore forward Taran Brown.</p>\n<p>With a return to health for the majority of its lineup and riding two important conference victories, the Gauchos are certainly poised to continue their run as a contender in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to come out last week and get two solid wins,” Boswell said. “It definitely gives us momentum, and we feel like we can compete with any team in the conference and that we’re the best team in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s matchup will certainly challenge the Gauchos, however, as the Rainbow Warriors are victorious in four of their past five games. Hawaii boasts an impressive 11-3 home record and leads the conference in scoring with over 82 points per game, over eight points better than the second ranked team.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be a tough game. They got some solid wins in the preseason and they have a lot of talent on their team,” Boswell said. “They’ve got some guards that are really quick and can push the tempo and they’ve also got some big guys that are a force to be reckoned with down low. We’ve just got to come out with a lot of energy like we have the last few games and play hard and let the game come to us.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Christian Standhardinger leads Hawaii in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.6) per game, ranking third and fifth in the conference, respectively. The Rainbow Warriors also tout sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year. Fotu ranks in the top 10 of the conference in both points and rebounds. Junior guard Garrett Nevels also places in the top 10 in Big West scoring, giving the Rainbow Warriors three top scorers.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be really difficult; Standhardinger is an awesome player. He gets to the foul line and is one of the best in our league,” Boswell said. “He’s a force in terms of driving to the basket and creating contact. You can’t completely eliminate a factor like him but if we can keep him contained, and make him work for his points and don’t give him second chance opportunities … I think we’ll have a pretty good shot at taking down the Warriors.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They’re doing what you want as you build a program for your seniors to be able to do.”</p>\n<p>Leading the way offensively for UCSB is two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection Nicole Nesbit, who leads the team and ranks second in the Big West in scoring at 18.1 points per game. Shooting 46.8 percent from the field, the senior guard also tops her team in three-point shooting at 39.5 percent and assists with 3.4 per game.</p>\n<p>Returning to her natural position of shooting guard this season, Nesbit has been given the green light to score and will have the ball in her hands during clutch situations. On Dec. 19, Nesbit joined the 1,000 point club, one of just 25 players in program history to hit this incredible milestone.</p>\n<p>“She’s always had the God-given ability,” Mitchell said. “She has a great jumper; she can score in a variety of ways, but I think it’s more the mental side and the confidence (this year) that she doesn’t let one play to dictate her mindset the rest of the game.”</p>\n<p>The second of UCSB’s three seniors is known for her versatility and defense. Playing positions one through four this year, guard Destini Mason averages 6.2 rebounds per game, second on the squad and tops among guards. She also adds 1.1 steals and .6 blocks per contest.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most improvement for Mason can be seen on the offensive end. Currently averaging 13.2 points per game, Mason has broken her career-high three times already this season, culminating against Hampton when she scored 23 points, 10 higher than her career-high last season.</p>\n<p>“Destini has played multiple positions for us and she’s done a great job at the four spot,” Mitchell said. “It’s allowed her to be in rebounding position because that’s what we were lacking, but we’ll need to move her back to the three spot a lot because defensively she gives us a guard with length.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final senior has been known for her shooting since her arrival at UCSB, but this year, guard Melissa Zornig has developed into an all-around player. Doing a bit of everything for the Gauchos, Zornig is currently averaging 12.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. At 2.5, she holds the highest assist to turnover ratio of the team, which is also good enough for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>Zornig also leads the team and the Big West in free throw percentage, shooting 88.4 percent. Combined with Nesbit, the two give UCSB two of the top three shooters from the charity stripe in the league.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest stat that stands out to me is her assist to turnover ratio,” Mitchell said. “She’s making the right decisions. She’s not shooting it as well from the three-point line, but she’s learned to score in a variety of ways, which makes her have an impact on games every night.”</p>\n<p>With their veteran leadership, UCSB’s “Big Three” have led the Gauchos to a 5-8 start. While its record may not look all that impressive, the team that has been to the postseason the last two seasons saw stiff competition during the non-conference portion of its schedule as Santa Barbara faced teams such as Arizona, St. Mary’s, San Diego State and Kansas State.</p>\n<p>UCSB lacks no experience playing in close games either with over half of the Gauchos’ games thus far being decided in the final minutes.</p>\n<p>“I think there are probably two or three games we had a chance to win, so our record would look a little bit different. But playing bigger, stronger, quicker in the non-conference will help us as we get to Big West play,” Mitchell said. “As a team, we’re where we need to be individually skilled wise and our team understanding roles.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in those losses was height. With only three forwards on the roster, and all being underclassmen, the average height on the Santa Barbara roster was 5’9’’.</p>\n<p>However, the height dilemma was resolved Dec. 20 when junior forward Clair Watkins was cleared by the NCAA to play for UCSB. At 6’4’’, Watkins transfers from Vanderbilt where she played two seasons with the Commodores. Now a grad student, the Gauchos had to wait for Watkins’ acceptance into the school. Once accepted, the NCAA immediately cleared her to play.</p>\n<p>In her three games as a Gaucho, Watkins has given Santa Barbara exactly what it was missing. Averaging 4.0 points and 1.0 block per game as well as team-highs in rebounding and steals with 7.0 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Watkins gives UCSB a defensive presence inside that will allow the team to compete with other teams in the Big West with height.</p>\n<p>“Clair allows us to be able to execute more in the half court, which I think all great teams have to at championship time,” Mitchell said. “With her body type and experience playing in the SEC, it is the defense and rebounding that will add the most to our team.”</p>\n<p>Currently last in the conference in rebounding at just 32.5 boards per game, rebounding has been a significant factor for UCSB in the win-loss column. Santa Barbara grabs 37.8 rebounds in victories compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“As soon as the ball goes up, we have to find a body and be aggressive,” Mason said. “Be the aggressor. We have to go after the ball. It takes heart, will and positioning.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s success in past years, with just five returning players from last season and a lack of height until the addition of Watkins, Santa Barbara remains the underdog going into conference play.</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason media poll, UCSB was predicted to finish fifth behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. In addition, no Gaucho was picked to the preseason all-Big West Conference first team, although Nesbit is averaging more points than the reigning Big West Player of the Year, Molly Schlemer from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Gauchos don’t mind being the underdog. The last time they were in a similar position, they won the Big West Tournament as the sixth seed.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be the underdog,” Zornig said. “We’ll go and prove people wrong.”</p>\n<p>In fact, this may be the team with the most potential under the Carlene Mitchell era as UCSB is putting more points on the scoreboard than any other team during Mitchell’s reign. Santa Barbara is currently averaging 67.1 points per game, much higher than the average 52.3 during the previous two seasons. The Gauchos also rank first in the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>In addition, despite the team’s new run and gun style, UCSB leads the conference in turnovers, giving the ball up just 13.8 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“When we pass the ball and we’re less selfish, we don’t have a lot of turnovers and we win the game, so I think that’s the main key to less turnovers is playing as a team,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>But at the heart of any team coached by Mitchell will always be defense. While not atop the Big West standings as in previous years, Santa Barbara still ranks third in the league in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.

We’re going to have to do a lot of things well to beat them on their home court,” Mitchell said. “The competitive side of me wants to win, but I want to win more for the seniors and I want to win more for this program and having the chance to win championships, and right now, that’s going through Poly.”</p>\n<p>In fact, only three players on the UCSB roster know the feeling of defeating the team’s biggest rival. Dating back to March 5, 2011, the seniors, guards Destini Mason, Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig, helped earn a 78-67 on the road over Cal Poly to become co-Big West Champions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now get another shot at Cal Poly Saturday when Mitchell and her squad open Big West play in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve haven’t beaten them since our freshman year, and not even on our home floor,” Zornig said. “It’s pretty frustrating, especially since some of the games have been close. I think for us seniors, it’d be huge to come out and beat them.”</p>\n<p>Both teams enter Saturday’s installment of the Blue-Green rivalry with recent struggles. At 5-8 overall, Santa Barbara has lost five of its last six games. Similarly, Cal Poly has dropped three of its last four, but Wednesday night improved to 7-7 overall and 1-0 in the Big West with a 78-74 overtime victory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Playing a long game Wednesday in Hawaii and then returning home for a game Saturday presents a taxing travel schedule for the Mustangs. Last season, teams who played Hawaii at the beginning of the week went 0-4 in their following game that weekend.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on top of the Blue-Green rivalry and defending a five-game winning streak over UCSB, Cal Poly will have the motivation of defending its home court, where the team is 5-0 so far this season.</p>\n<p>“You know you’re going to expect energy with the tradition these two programs have had and the rivalry,” Mitchell said. “I don’t have to say anything and I’m sure [Cal Poly Head Coach Faith Nimnaugh] doesn’t have to say anything for the players to show up and understand how important this game is.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in previous years for the Gauchos was the Mustang’s potent offense, which will once again serve as a challenge as Cal Poly tops the Big West in scoring with 74.9 points per game. Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions also rank second in the conference in field goal percentage and three point percentage, shooting 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Option number one on the offensive end for Cal Poly is the reigning Big West Player of the Year, 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer. Schlemer ranks third in the Big West in points per game (17.8), first in rebounding (10.8) and second in field goal percentage (54.7 percent).</p>\n<p>Taking the assignment on Schlemer will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins, who averages a team-high 7.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals in her three games with UCSB after transferring from Vanderbilt.</p>\n<p>“All five times (we’ve lost) the problem has been on the defensive side of it. We have to try to figure out a way to guard Molly,” Mitchell said. “Even though (last year’s senior center Kirsten) Tilleman was blue-collar and had the toughness, she was legit 6’1’’,” Mitchell said. “This year, we’ve worked on a lot more zone, so I think we can mix it up a lot more where it’s not just one on one post defense.”</p>\n<p>However, Schlemer is one of just several options for the Mustangs offensively. The team also features two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last season in a pair of point guards. Junior Ariana Elegado is currently averaging 15.5 points and a team-high 4.6 assists per game, good enough to tie her for first in the Big West. Senior Jonae Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. Wednesday night against Hawaii, Ervin exploded for a career-high 37 points and team-high 10 rebounds to help her team come back from 17 down to win.</p>\n<p>“As seniors we know what to expect and I’m telling [our teammates], ‘be ready for these guards’ because they’re no joke,” Mason said. “They’re very talented and smart and know how to play together.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, if UCSB wants a chance for a victory, it will have to play incredible defense. While not as dominant as in previous years, the Gauchos still rank third in the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then have to finish the job defensively by rebounding. Cal Poly leads the conference in rebounding at 43.9 per game while UCSB ranks last in the category with just 32.5 boards per game. In addition, in victories, the Gauchos average 37.8 rebounds compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re full fronting and you need to roll to get in rebounding position or you got caught behind, you have to put a body on [Molly],” Mitchell said. “She’s big and you have to make the refs call it. You’re not going to get any calls unless you block out and make contact.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB is a much improved team this year, putting up an average of 67.1 points on the scoreboard each outing, almost 15 more points per game than in Mitchell’s previous two seasons. The Gauchos also lead the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos have succeeded with the fast break, Saturday will be all about defense.</p>\n<p>“We definitely don’t want a track meet. We’re not going to outscore anyone and I’ll continue to say that we have the ability to score high 60’s and 70’s any given night,” Mitchell said. “Defense will be the emphasis. I probably won’t even write any offenses on the board because I think if we can do the things we need to on the defensive end of things, we’ll have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A. Mott Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53479\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/ucsb-begins-big-west-play-at-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53479\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/ucsb-begins-big-west-play-at-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/ucsb-begins-big-west-play-at-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/ucsb-begins-big-west-play-at-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-09/ucsb-begins-big-west-play-at-cal-poly/","id":572,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[571,570,569],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
