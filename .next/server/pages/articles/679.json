Along with the Yankees’ former owner George Steinbrenner, Buss always did what it took to make his team the best. He never shied away from the biggest personalities or from opening up the checkbook to sign players and coaches like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy, Pat Riley, Phil Jackson, Shaquille O’Neil, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and, of course, Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>But now all of that is in the past. His death, along with the fact that the Lakers’ supposed “super team” is a meager 25-29 and the Clippers are turning into a powerhouse, confirm that the Lakers franchise is at a major turning point. Without the wise and omniscient leadership of Dr. Buss, where does one of the most beloved and recognizable franchises in the world go from here?</p>\n<p>First of all, if the Lakers miraculously make the playoffs, the consensus is that they don’t have the tools or chemistry to consistently beat any one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They simply do not put together a consistent winning formula night in and night out.</p>\n<p>Howard’s health and attitude seem to be in a constant state of uncertainty. Nash and Coach D’Antoni are torn between running a quick-paced offense and running a slower half-court offense. Kobe is still playing well, but is beginning to hint at retirement.</p>\n<p>Above all else, this Lakers team no longer expects to win. When the Lakers are at their best, they expect to win every single game. Now the first question is how badly did they lose tonight?</p>\n<p>Looking beyond this year, Bryant has one year left on his contract worth $30.4 million, Howard becomes a free agent after this season, Gasol has one year left on his contract worth $19.2 million, Metta World Peace has a player option for next year worth $7.7 million and Nash has two years remaining worth a combined $20 million.</p>\n<p>All of that means that after next season, Nash will be the only current player under contract assuming Howard, Gasol and Bryant all leave. So, what do the Lakers need to do? What they always do, use the salary cap space to spend the money and use the L.A. lifestyle to bring championship players to their team.</p>\n<p>One thing that would go a long way in helping the Lakers achieve that would be to retain the services of current General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who was Dr. Buss’ right-hand man. Kupchak is widely respected around the league and will help make the ownership transition from Dr. Buss to his children much smoother with his experience at handling the Lakers.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/lakers-at-a-crossroads-without-owner-jerry-buss/","id":679,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[678,677,676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore","biography":"Not available","articles":[679,699,1785,2103,2115,2116,3183,3186,3187,3209,3214,4499,4540,5123,5153,5154,5155,5156,5157,5158,5159,5161,5163,5165,5166,5168,5169,5170,5171,5172],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Seeks Revenge in Blue-Green Rivalry Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Blue-Green Rivalry game is always an intense matchup, but this Saturday, a potential Big West title could be on the line.

Last weekend, UCSB came away with two road wins up north, defeating UC Davis 60-52 before upsetting Pacific 52-47.</p>\n<p>Down 14 three minutes into the second half, the Gauchos used balanced offense, featuring three players in double figures, as well as its typical tenacious defense to hold the Tigers to nearly 25 points below their average and overcome the top team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep doing what we’re doing,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “Obviously we’re doing something right, but we’re still humble. We’re not getting too excited and losing our focus.”</p>\n<p>After the pair of victories, Underwood was named the Big West Player of the Week for the fourth time this season. She averaged a double-double in the road wins with 14.5 points and 14 rebounds, including a career-high 16 rebounds against Pacific.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about me; it’s a team thing,” Underwood said. “I think when we have individual awards, it’s a reflection of our team and our coaching staff and the hard work and effort we’ve put in as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB holds an incredible 7-4 record away from home, Santa Barbara will have to find a way to win in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are only 3-6 at home, but will have the opportunity to put back-to-back home wins together for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s been the million dollar question with this team,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We have to bring a lot of energy because when we go into away gyms, that’s already manifested itself. Of course, [the energy is] going against us and for some reason, we like that. But, I think it’s going to be fun playing in our house and it’s a big rivalry game, so it’ll be a fun Saturday.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s last game against Cal Poly wasn’t fun for the Gauchos. A weak outing for Santa Barbara resulted in a 66-47 loss in San Luis Obispo. UCSB was unable to stop the Mustangs’ strong offense in the second half, giving up 38 second-half points and allowing them to shoot 56.7 percent from the field. The loss was the Gauchos’ third straight to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“I definitely [think there’s a revenge factor],” Nesbit said. “Looking back on the film and watching our offensive execution, their transition offense and our transition defense, it was just horrendous. So, I think we’re excited because we know we’re a lot better than we were then.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Molly Schlemer and senior guard Kayla Griffin were especially on fire, combining for 43 points and nearly outscoring UCSB on their own. At 6’5’’, Schlemer was a problem in the post for UCSB while Griffin was 3-4 from three-point range and tallied nine rebounds, five assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“I think we took a lot of switches that last game and they exploited some of our smaller guards on Griffin in the low post area and then we also had some miscommunication in transition,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, our transition defense has to be a lot better and in the half court, we’ll try to mix things up against Schlemer. But when you don’t have 6’3’’ or 6’4’’ to guard her, you’re pretty limited on what player you decide to put on her.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s solid offensive performance against the Gauchos wasn’t a fluke either. The Mustangs rank second in the Big West in scoring offense at 68.6 points per game and lead the league in field goal percentage at 40.9 percent.</p>\n<p>“They’re a potent team,” Mitchell said. “They know that they can match you, so they’re willing to give up a basket and then get it out and they’re off to a track meet. We can’t let it become a track meet because that’s not what we do well.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key this week for the Gauchos will be defense, especially in transition.

Earlier in the season, UCSB defeated Cal Poly in an 83-81 double-overtime thriller. Emotions can certainly be expected to be running high when these two teams face off again on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We got some good practices this week, and even though we have a lot of injuries, I feel like a lot of guys are going to be healthy and ready to go by this weekend,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “Coming off a big win against Pacific, I feel like we’ve got some momentum rolling and a lot of us are starting to understand what it’s going to take to get some more wins and go on a winning streak in the next few games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Mustangs, Boswell hit what would become a game-winning three-point play with 12 seconds left and scored the Gauchos final six points. Boswell is currently second on the team, averaging 13 points per game, and has switched roles much of the season between a starter and the sixth man.</p>\n<p>“We know playing them the first time that Cal Poly is a scrappy team and they’re talented,” Boswell said. “We’re going to have to bring a high energy level and execute at a high level in order to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may be without its star player in sophomore center Alan Williams who sprained his right ankle in the first half of the Pacific game. Williams has missed three games this season due to an injury to his hamstring, an injury that first occurred in that double-overtime victory against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He’s moving around a lot better than he did when he got hurt last weekend,” Boswell said. “I can tell things are getting better, so it’d be great if he’s available for this Saturday, but if not, we’ll be ready regardless and we’ll have a chance to win whatever his status is.”</p>\n<p>With the possibility UCSB will be without its star player, the Gauchos might have to rely on freshman forward Sam Beeler to fill in for Big Al. Beeler has come on strong as of late, playing a career-high 23 minutes against Pacific in which he scored six points and grabbed four boards. Another player UCSB will rely on is junior forward Shawn Moore, a walk-on in his first season as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be huge because we’re going to need depth,” Boswell said. “We’ll be ready to go. Cal Poly is a good team and if we don’t all come together and basically contribute individually in order to make our team better, we’re not going to get this win this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off two straight victories over Pacific and UC Davis, and will end a three-game homestand Saturday. Overall, UCSB has won 11 of the last 12 meetings against Cal Poly and owns the all-time series record 69-31.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are led by junior forward Chris Eversley, who is first on the team in scoring with 15.4 points per game and the only player to average double figures for Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson will also be pivotal in Saturday’s matchup, as each has shown flashes of brilliance this season for the Gauchos. Brown is third on the team averaging 12.1 points and Bryson is fourth at 6.9 points per game. In his last three games, however, Bryson is averaging 12.7 points and six rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody needs to step up,” Coach Williams said. “Injuries are not an excuse, it’s just what happens and it creates opportunities for other guys.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green rivalry game is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at Cal Poly’s Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/","id":677,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[676,675,674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Basketball: Cal State Northridge Matadors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last year, a young Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team surprised everyone, finishing second in the Big West.

The Matadors have taken on No. 21 Oklahoma, No. 8 Penn State and No. 14 UCLA.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s always about getting better,” Flowers said. “We felt like with the team we had, we had to challenge them early.”</p>\n<p>The UCLA game proved the potential of this young squad as the team beat the Bruins 77-72 on Dec. 20 at Pauley Pavilion. At the time, UCLA was ranked No. 12 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“[Our players] believed they could win and we got it done at both ends of the floor,” Flowers said. “It was great for our kids to get that experience and getting the win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Matadors are four underclassmen. Two of the team’s sophomore guards, Janae Sharpe and Ashlee Guay, were predicted to make the all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Guay leads the team with 13.8 points per game, good enough for fifth in the Big West. She also ranks third in the Big West in assists and second in steals with 3.9 and 3.0, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Ashley’s been good for us,” Flowers said. “She’s a tough kid and she’s running the offense. She’s [also] the first line of the defense.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore center Camille Mahlknecht anchors the team inside, leading the conference in blocked shots with 2.4 per game and ranking fourth in rebounding, pulling down 8.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Finally, freshman forward Marta Masoni fills a weakness from last year’s team: threepoint shooting.
