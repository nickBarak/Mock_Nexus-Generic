Prince used to piggyback around on his bodyguard’s back in nightclubs, Kurt Cobain came out to the biggest show of his life in a wedding dress and wheelchair and Iggy Pop just never wore a shirt –– like, ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an underground urban legend of Los Angeles with more recorded low-fi material than anyone can keep track of, Ariel Pink is one of those rare, mysterious kinds of artists. Luckily for those who know what’s what, Ariel Pink hit SOhO last week with openers DIIV and Savage Henry to bring some of those underground vibes to the Santa Barbara audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A prominent figure in indie music for nearly two decades, Ariel Pink is known for his mysteriously large amount of recorded content and his unique lo-fi aesthetic. He is an L.A. icon that is always a treat in the rare moments he performs live. Coming off of his 2017 homage </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which received widespread acclaim from critics, Ariel Pink is hitting the road in multiple countries and has brought DIIV along for some of the stops. The two mesh well together and were benefited by the help of their local opener.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista icons and obvious Hunter S. Thompson reference Savage Henry also opened the night off with some heavy rock tunes before DIIV and Ariel Pink dismantled the stage. As someone who has seen this band many times in quite a few local sweaty backyards, I can personally attest to the talent and drive of this band. Their performance was tons of fun and featured a group of very likeable and talented musicians. Although it may appear easy to doubt the tangible potential for industry success in these hot local Isla Vista bands, no one can deny their talent and poise, and the opening for legend Ariel Pink is no dismissable task.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140889214\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83329\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83333\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-25/ariel-pink-and-diiv-were-indie-as-fuck-at-soho/the-real-savage-henry-soho-siavash_ghadiri-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Real Savage Henry @SOhO Siavash_Ghadiri (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DIIV was a clearly effective primer for Ariel Pink’s performance as the more mellow atmospheric sounds and elaborate light set provided a spacy backdrop for the night. I have seen DIIV play excellently before, and their SOhO set was no different. Their instrumentals nailed their usual perfect blend of clean and ambient with just the right amount of reverb and all cues were executed as cleanly as ever. A talented group that has played together for a long time, this set was clearly not their first, as hits such as “Dopamine,” “Doused” and, of course, “Under the Sun,” were executed effortlessly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After chilling out at the patio in the afterglow of DIIV, my friend and I moved up close to catch the man of the hour, the mastermind himself, Ariel Pink in all of his weird glory. After a beautiful musical blur of over an hour, I can now say in full confidence that Ariel Pink was very weird and very glorious. His presence was all that I could have imagined –– plus more that I could never have –– with beautifully strange and staggered stage presence, intense and clearly visible passion, an extremely cohesive backing band and just a shitton of high quality jams.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83331\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

ever seen, sporting a half-cut hairstyle with one side long and one side short, jean shorts that went far above his knees and a classic striped “Guess Jeans” t-shirt. With a mic full of stylistic reverb and distortion, Pink strutted and poured over his lo-fi instrumentals like no one else. His opening tunes included some standouts from his newest work, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as most of his stops on the tour has revolved around the album. Some of the earlier plays included aggressive punk era thrasher “Time to Meet Your God,” and ambient pop landscape “Bubblegum Dreams.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The later parts of his set included more selections from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as “Feels Like Heaven,” “I Wanna Be Young” and standout late night ballad “Another Weekend,” which was arguably the highlight of the night. The mellowed-out reflective change of pace gave a moment of breathing room for the audience as Pink crooned over a dreamy backdrop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The L.A. recluse also provided some deeper cuts from his repertoire as expected with someone of his lengthy and deep discography. Some other cuts included “Lipstick,” from 2014 project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pom pom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and pop ballad “Baby,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mature Themes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pink also included a number of tracks from his 2006 classic album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House Arrest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the title track as well as “Hardcore Pops are Fun,” that his backup singer pretenced with “There’s glam pop, and then there’s hardcore pop!” Such a simple yet important statement effectively summarized the cultural pull of Ariel Pink as a genre bender and musical journey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stepping off for a quick encore after an electrifying set, Ariel Pink came back out to finish with “House Arrest,” standout “Netherlands” and end with “Bobby Jameson,” B-side “Ode to the Goat,” which came as a thank you to us as an audience as well as a thank you to his inspirations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall the set was incredible with almost 20 tracks performed, all with intense personality and emotion. It seemed to fly by with quick transitions and intoxicating daze, and the man himself proved to be an absolute great and a symbol in the world of music. Ariel Pink is someone I will surely see again in the future and has opened up my eyes to the full extent and range of his work. A door was opened that gracefully pushes some more casual fans to explore just everything that this lasting artist has to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariel Pink is a mystery, an icon and indie as fuck. He has ever-expanding layers of depth and art that reach farther than most people can really know, and even knowing a little bit about him is equal to knowing nothing at all.

The beautiful summer month in which corporate logos begin their annual wardrobe change from monochrome mundaneness to rainbow realness. While in recent years corporations have welcomed Pride Month and inclusion with open arms, Pride marches and movements stem from a history of struggle, as queer people battled for representation and acceptance in all arenas of life. While many battles may appear to be definitively won, recent moves by the current presidential administration to stifle LGBTQ+ rights signal the ever-growing importance of Pride Month and LGBTQ+ representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how many rainbow scarves Tony the Tiger wears, the spirit of inclusion, self-acceptance and equality that Pride represents will remain important. Musicians and artists have always been at the forefront of social change, and a recent wave of confident queer artists have helped usher in a new era of Pride Month jams. In honor of the month of the Gays, below is a definitive list of new and old Pride Month Bangers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. “Bloom”- Troye Sivan</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troye Sivan, the sweet prince of pop, has been delivering danceable summer jams since his early days as a teen Youtuber. His 2015 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighbourhood </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gave us his first exploration of queer identity as a coming-to-age and coming out album, in which he explored the struggles of discovering and shaping one’s identity. However, “Bloom,” the title track off his upcoming album, finds a much more confident and self-assured Sivan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright pop song follows Sivan into a field of flower fueled metaphors, allusions and innuendos as he tackles the previously unexplored and unmentionable topic of gay sex. His sweet melodies and smooth voice take listeners on an intimate yet euphoric journey on a topic which has previously been ushered into the shadows. A music video, which matches the bright, colorful vibe of the track, explores both Sivan’s masculinity and femininity and questions the lines drawn between the two. The song and video shine the vibrant hues of Pride by turning a fun dance track into a vehicle for representation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41PTANtZFW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. “Pynk (feat. Grimes)” – Janelle Monae</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monae, a multifaceted talent, has been nominated for Grammys, has appeared in Oscar-winning films and has been deemed a fashion icon. Her decision to come out as openly pansexual this year on her album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirty Computer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allows her to add “LGBTQ+ Icon” to that impressive list. Monae’s confident attitude and charismatic charm endows each track of the album with energy. However, “Pynk”’s artful celebration of the female existence seems especially important after Monae’s recent powerful statement of truth. Monae, a protégé of the purple man, Prince, finds her own color by imbuing pink as the color of feminine sexuality, power and desire. The romantic song manages to sound both upbeat and tender as Monae expresses desire and appreciation for women. Monae’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics create a playful dimension to this feminine, queer anthem. The song’s video, which features Monae and backup dancers dressed in what can only be described as “vagina pants,” perfectly accompanies the song’s sweet, funky vibes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaYvlVR_BEc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. “Supermodel” – RuPaul</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before RuPaul had “Drag Race” glued to his last name and an entire empire, he was simply America’s most famous drag queen. Oh, yeah, and a bigtime recording artist. “Supermodel,” one of the most-fun songs ever to be recorded, imbues joy into the ears of anyone who hears its banging beat. As RuPaul commands his listeners to, “Work it, covergirl,” “Give us a twirl” and “Do your thing on the runway,” his listeners actually transform into runway models, equipped with fierce poses and sickening faces. After listening to this song maybe 500 times this month, the Hadids better watch out because this writer is ready for his Vogue debut. The song preaches the same self-acceptance and confidence which the ever popular reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” evokes in its viewers, allowing Supermodel to be a Pride Month dancefloor staple. This irresistible track captures the energy, confidence and love Pride pushes forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vw9LOrHU8JI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>4. “Chanel” – Frank Ocean</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2012, Frank Ocean became the first openly-gay major hip hop artist after he released his landmark album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channel Orange</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While Ocean’s dreamy, velvety vocals launched him into musical stardom, his idiosyncratic lyrics have pushed him among contemporary legends. On “Chanel,” a single from 2017, Ocean is in top form, delivering verse after verse that challenges and questions societal norms of gender, sexuality and success. Ocean’s lines flow and build upon each other, creating layers of meaning culminating in heart-wrenching croons. Ocean “sees both sides like Chanel,” and can “see on both sides like Chanel,” referencing both the fashion brand’s crossed “C” logo and his appreciation for his lover’s feminine and masculine sides. The quality of art delivered by Ocean makes him the queer icon we need and deserve. Chanel gives us an opportunity to appreciate all of Ocean’s talents, and that’s something we can all be proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnbsIl2BnWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>5. “I Don’t Want It at All” – Kim Petras</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Petras’ sugary-pop sound can only be described as a lollipop covered completely in Fun Dip. On her breakthrough single, “I Don’t Want It at All</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Petras is at maximum exuberance demanding — not asking — for all her wants and needs to be answered. If not delivered with Petras’ signature sweet and fun charisma, the song could sound flat and shallow. But with Petras in the driver’s seat, the song steers into the lane of colorful pop perfection. Petras first launched into international awareness as a young German teen fighting the German government for the right to receive sex reassignment surgery. After becoming the youngest person to ever undergo the surgery, Petras began writing songs and pursuing her dream of pop stardom. Petras’ mastery of pop signals that being trans and a popstar are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, her talent, charm and ambition proves her place in the future of pop and as a prominent figure of Pride.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC9FA8lZRy8</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83617\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83617\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-29/five-pride-month-bangers/","id":6645,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6644,6643,6642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Crush by Ravyn Lenae","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ravyn-lenae.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ravyn-lenae.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In Crush, Steve Lacy and Ravyn Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p>In a music world filled with young, braggadocious rappers pushing many of the same beats time and time again, it is rare to find a creative duo as young as Ravyn Lenae and Steve Lacy.

When he is not busy making beats on his iPhone, Lacy can also be heard accompanying artists such as Tyler, The Creator or Goldink, laying out some passionate vocals on songs like “911/Mr. Lonely” or “Some Girl.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lenae has released two EPs prior to <em>Crush</em>. On each she takes similar approaches to some funky instrumentals as she does on her project with Lacy. Her dreamy voice shines on her collaboration with Mick Jenkins, the bouncy, club-like banger “Communicate.” Lenae has also made appearances on albums like <em>blkswn</em> by Smino and <em>Telefone</em> by Noname in which she complements her peers to create passionate lyricism. But each of these seem to pale in comparison to the alliance which is Lenae and Lacy.</p>\n<p>Lenae’s voice is versatile as we receive what sounds like an attempt to escape the boundaries of her own vocal capacities. Her shrill singing on the EP single and opening track, “Sticky,” is reminiscent of the way Frank Ocean experiments with high pitched vocals on songs like “Ivy” or “Pretty Sweet” off of <em>Blonde</em>. Nonetheless, this is where Lenae finds power in testing the limitation of her vocal prowess. She gives Erykah Badu-esque vocals as she induces a dreamlike environment for her listeners when singing, “Slipping ‘til you let me drown; Hate me then you love me now.”</p>\n<p>Not a single moment does Lacy allow us to forget about his psychedelic guitar. On “Closer (Ode 2 U)” the groovy producer makes his presence known through consistently sexy instrumentation. Toward the back end of the track, the lush bass transcends Lenae into a falsetto over Lacy’s faint voice singing “Baby pull me closer, you should let me love you.” With “Computer Luv,” Lacy proves that he can provide a backdrop for Lenae with not only decorative guitar patterns but also through vocal elements as he accompanies her on the song’s hook.</p>\n<p>But really, where the two stand out is with their ability to make use of simplistic instrumentals. This is where Lacy finds success most: in his combination of seemingly effortless but unique guitar chords and synths. Like in his aforementioned standout production on Kendrick Lamar’s “LUST,” Lacy gives a repetitive, unconventional guitar riff on “4 Leaf Clover.” However, this is arguably the standout track of the five-song project. The R&amp;B singers bounce off of one another in synchronization to create a pretty, elegant blend. The duet combines to share their fear of commitment, uncertainty and taking the next step in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, <em>Crush</em> is a modern take on old school R&amp;B. Each song is perfect for laying back, plugging in your headphones and lighting a candle to embrace the sensuality that Lenae and Lacy provide. It is clear that the young duo rely heavily on their predecessors. In <em>Crush</em>, Lacy and Lenae travel together through lingering compositions, unraveling one another’s potential as musicians. When asked about his opinion on the collaboration, Lacy looked at it as his “Pharrell/Kelis” or “Timbaland/Aaliyah” moment. Although the two have not quite reached such a level, the young virtuosos have created a more than exceptional collection of sensational, romantic ballads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-23/the-friday-review-crush-by-ravyn-lenae/","id":6646,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6645,6644,6643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Modest Mouse Gets Weird at the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3687-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3687-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Their sound is a bit punk: catchy, shouty, angry, fun.

The marquee announced it in big red letters. The band, led by singer and guitarist Isaac Brock, had their heyday in the mid-2000s, but their pull was still strong enough to draw a pretty jazzed crowd that night. There are a lot of people in their thirties trying to look like people in their twenties; the phrase I’ve decided on is Uncle Hipster. This means trimmed beards and flannel for the fellas, t-shirts and jeans for the ladies. Some leather, not much. Tattoos, if extant, are concealed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the marquee, people are clumped in twos and threes, taking pictures. I head over to the merch table, intent on spending money. T-shirts and hoodies are up on the wall. The designs are pretty weird, especially the one I end up getting: a deep blue t-shirt with a buck staring out of the center, neck and body mirrored left and right. MODEST MOUSE glows in green, blue and pink lettering which, combined with the neo-’80s typeface and mirrored deer, results in a sort of confetti psychedelia. That same shirt is everywhere inside, stretched over chests and peeking under hoodies. At what frequency does a faux-pas cease to be a faux-pas? I stash my shirt under-arm and head to my seat, where I sit until the openers come on around eight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re called Mimicking Birds, a soothing, toothless indie-folk group. They play an hour of decently groovy stuff over blue and sea-green light. The singer thanks us and thanks us again for being there. Everyone claps indulgently. Mimicking Birds leave, and the shapes of the stage crew materialize on stage, testing wires and mics. The stage is dark for 20 minutes. Then the maintenance shapes leave and other, better-dressed shapes emerge, picking up guitars, twirling drumsticks. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd cheers and claps.

A recurring concern is the hot sauce that he swears stings his eyes. “I had a taco earlier,” he explains, “with the hot sauce, and then I rubbed my eyes.” Someone brings him a towel several songs in, and he stands on stage dabbing his eyes with it. We cheer encouragingly. He goes on to perform a spirited, idiosyncratic show, though the towel makes several more appearances before the night is out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They played a mix of earlier cuts and later hits, including “Dashboard,” “Missed the Boat,” “Fire It Up,” and “The World at Large.” A lot of Modest Mouse’s stuff is nautical-sounding (especially their 2007 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), possibly inspired by Brock’s house flooding three times in his teens. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"983586179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83338\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83341\" data-attachment-id=\"83341\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/dfx_3060/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DFX_3060\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83341\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DFX_3060.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their sound is a bit punk: catchy, shouty, angry, fun. Brock’s delivery defines their sound — his voice is somewhere between a yelp and a howl, conversational one second and guttural the next. Johnny Marr brought jangly guitar arrangements to their ’04 and ’07 albums, and the effect is propulsive and buoyant. The lights that night were cool, dynamic and synchronized snugly with the rhythm. A good mix of motion, color and strobe-y effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conspicuously absent, however, was the band’s 2004 mega-hit, “Float On.” If you know one song by Modest Mouse, it’s that one. Brock’s decision not to play their biggest hit was disappointing at first, but, upon further thought, made more sense than the alternative, considering his abundantly weird stage presence and, judging by his interviews, presence in general. (One album promo features a mustached Brock interrogating a neck-braced Brock, who consults the lawyer beside him when asked questions like “Who are the members of your band?”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halfway through the show, Brock asks us how we’re doing tonight. We cheer, as audiences do. Brock looks disappointed. “Now,” he says, “when I ask you how you’re doing tonight, I want you to remain totally silent. It’ll be uncomfortable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hush develops as the crowd tries to figure out why he isn’t playing “Float On.” People look around. Some clap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How are you doing tonight?!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scattered, defiant cheers. Brock, unfazed, repeats his question. “How are you doing tonight?” Most obey this time, not saying anything, except for some dudes a couple rows up. In their Aviators and OCBDs, they whoop-whoop into the silence of the theater. The moment’s over. Isaac Brock says, “This is turning into a different experiment than the one I’d envisioned.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83338\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83338\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-26/modest-mouse-gets-weird-at-the-arlington/","id":6647,"author":{"id":764,"name":"Andre Bouyssounouse"},"related":[6646,6645,6644],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
