A more permanent solution—of wood fences up to four-and-a-half feet tall—will be supported by $70,000 from UCSB, the university announced Tuesday. <em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The university said it will cover the entire estimated cost for the installation of the fences and has agreed that if the project comes in under budget, the remaining funds will be used by the county for maintaining the fence. The fences will run from the end of Del Playa Open Space Park to Walter Capps Park and will include all parks owned by the county and the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD). Once the fence is completed, the county will assume responsibility for future maintenance and repairs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement in the fencing project since the death of multiple students from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/cliff-fall-victim-paralyzed-from-waist-down/\">cliff falls</a> in 2013 has largely contributed to the university’s decision to provide funding to the county.</p>\n<p>“Chancellor Yang has been deeply involved in this project since the beginning, when Molly Morrison founded Fence Isla Vista, and since we lost students to cliff-related deaths and injuries,” Schunk said. “Yang has taken a very active and involved role in this entire effort so I think part of it was him pushing it and making it a top priority.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological sciences major and Fence I.V. founder Molly Morrison said she founded her organization, which aims to improve current fencing standards along the cliffs on Del Playa Drive, after her friend and <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/woman-found-on-isla-vista-beach-identified-as-cal-poly-slo-student/\">Cal Poly SLO student Giselle Ayala</a>, along with three other students, died after falling from the cliffs since April 2013.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s extremely vital to make these occurrences as preventable as possible,” Morrison said. “I do believe the personal responsibility is also an extremely vital aspect in these scenarios, but there is work to be done on both ends to help end these tragedies.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said she believes the university decided to fund the project due to Santa Barbara county’s historical lack of funding to improve fencing along the I.V. cliffs.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that they have been inactive, but that it has taken so long to find a source of funding that should normally be very fast, as fencing is one of the largest safety concerns in Santa Barbara area,” Morrison said. “[UCSB’s contribution] is extremely helpful, as it is funding the entire project. I am so grateful for the generous donors who have dedicated their resources to help make this place safer.”</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD general manager Rodney Gould, the university’s contribution to the project is critical to its timely completion because the project was not a budgeted expense for the district and therefore was difficult to fund. Gould said construction should begin shortly given the end of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>“I know the funding has been received by the County and they are in discussions with a contractor,” Gould said in an email. “My best guess, and it is only a guess, is that construction will begin in the next few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the fences installed along the bluffs will be three-ring wood fences up to 54 inches high with diamond-shaped, nylon-coated chain links to prevent someone from being able to climb over the fence.</p>\n<p>“The idea for the small diamonds is so you can’t fit your hands or toes into it easily and climb over it,” Schunk said. “The thing to keep in mind is we aren’t going for a high security fence because we’re looking at prevention.”</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the university and the county have been working on installing I.V. bluff fencing since last Fall and that the recent funding will finally ensure the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>“I asked the chancellor last October in a letter to fund a couple of county projects, starting with the bluff fencing, and the county said that we would do the maintenance once it was installed,” Farr said. “It’s on our agenda for next week so I’m really happy to see that it’s finally coming together.”</p>\n<p>Farr also said the county wants to make open park spaces on DP as safe as possible in light historical cliff falls resulting in the death of multiple students since 2005.</p>\n<p>“We warn people about the danger of the bluffs and although there have always been some kind of a fence up there to deter people, they either obey the signs or go around the fencing and walk on the other side,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, many individuals do not take into account that the cliffs’ eroding nature make their edges particularly dangerous for people treading the Del Playa bluffs.</p>\n<p>“People also need to understand that the geologic material of those bluffs are very erosive so they’re constantly crumbling away. I think that’s another reason why people might make the mistake sometimes and think there’s more property on the other side of the fence than there really is,” Farr said. “So we’re constantly monitoring it from a public safety standpoint from the beach side as well as from the upper side.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the university’s contribution is helpful, he hopes it is more than a one-time effort to improve safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I hope this influx of funds towards I.V. and level of attention is not temporary because of the events last spring, but history tells us it is,” Abboud said in an email. “I’m optimistic that this time around we can come up with a long term solution that keeps everyone involved and helping better Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Cameron Schunk stating a preference for a high security fence. Schunk actually said the fence were for prevention, not high security purposes.

First Friday planners were initially organizing a larger-than-average version of the event with multiple stages but ran into issues once Santa Barbara County approved noise ordinances during the first two weekends of April in order to prevent this year’s Deltopia from becoming disorderly. I.V. First Friday is coordinated by I.V. Open Lab, a project-based course offered by the university’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and sponsored by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) and the I.V. Food Co-Op. The event is hosted as a late-night alternative to what many students call the “I.V. party scene,” and is held the first Friday of every month at Perfect Park, featuring live local music, artwork, improvisation and dance performances and more.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, the original plan for the First Friday on April 3 was to have a number of groups and organizations co-host a block party that would have been larger than most First Fridays to date.</p>\n<p>“We were actually considering fencing off the entire end of the loop and having multiple stages with varying forms of entertainment operating simultaneously,” Gould said in an email. “Before we got very far into the planning, we realized we couldn’t proceed due to the festival ordinance that was put into place for Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Gould said the original proposal for I.V. First Friday was suggested in anticipation of the influx of people expected to come to I.V. during Deltopia weekend, which attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers in last April. </p>\n<p>“We figured that there would be a lot of people in town that night,” Gould said in an email. “The University has planned a lot of things Saturday as alternatives, but there was nothing on Friday, so we thought this might take some of the burden off the Del Playa partying.”</p>\n<p>Gould said I.V. Open Lab is now exploring the possibility of having an art show in the early evening of April 3 at the I.V. Clinic building that would feature I.V.’s “hidden art community.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of resident artists in Isla Vista that people just don’t know about that have been here for years, so we thought it would be kind of fun to showcase that,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the students of I.V. Open Lab are also discussing organizing a silent movie series and a silent disco, though the plans for the First Friday to be held on April 3 are still dependent on approval from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out a mellow, outdoor lounge-like event for that Friday,” Yasuda said. “We also want it to be local, so that’s why we’re showcasing the resident artists’ artwork. The visual display is quiet, the disco is quiet and then we thought about silent movies.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and I.V. Open Lab student Itxy Quintanilla said it was disappointing to learn the initial plans for the First Friday on April 3 could not be executed.</p>\n<p>“We are saving those plans for a future month,” Quintanilla said in an email. “We understand the reason for the implementation of these ordinances, but it has been difficult to work around them.”</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said she is hopeful the newly proposed events will be approved by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“After throwing around several ideas and discussing the ordinances, we hope that our movie in the park proposal will meet the guidelines and provide a safe and engaging community gathering,” Quintanilla said in an email. “Hopefully our plans are approved in order to create another successful event.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said the collaboration between students, faculty, residents and local businesses is what makes First Fridays special, and she hopes the First Friday scheduled for the night of April 3 can still take place.</p>\n<p>“We want it to happen and we think it’s going to be great and attract the right kind of people,” Yasuda said. “We feel it is really important to have programming that is creative, safe and alternative, because if you have nothing, then that’s when the trouble starts.” Yasuda said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/","id":4739,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4738,4737,4736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Talk Graffiti, Fences","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Community members and local government officials met Tuesday night at the weekly Isla Vista self-governance meeting hosted by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office in the I.V.

Clinic to further discuss potential services and funding that a Community Services District (CSD) would entail.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, university administrators and members of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors have been meeting weekly for the past several months to discuss Williams’s I.V. self-governance bill AB 3, which was introduced in December to establish I.V. as a CSD which can potentially levy taxes in order to provide residents certain infrastructure and services. Currently, the group is discussing the details of a potential I.V. CSD to fund graffiti removal, bluff fencing and other services.</p>\n<p>According to Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Doreen Farr, the county does not provide adequate funding for graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have money for graffiti abatement so every year what I do is go to UCSB for $2,000, go to the county for $2,000 and the property owners for $2,500,” Aguilera said. “This year the I.V. Property Association did not give us $2,500 so I had to find somewhere that amount. Every year we have to go through this process. The county is not set up to do graffiti abatement.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera said while the county does partially fund graffiti abatement services for I.V., funding is not guaranteed in the future.</p>\n<p>“You have someone in the third district who actively is asking for money and that’s how graffiti is being taken care of, but when the third district supervisor is no longer there, it’s going to be a problem,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<p>According to second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, the county does not have adequate funding mechanisms in place to provide much needed fencing for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it kind of shows some of the pitfalls of the [county] services,” Minoiefar said. “In the part that says ‘sexual assaults and riots,’ maybe mention cliff falls and things like that. … We can’t even keep people from falling from the cliffs.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera also said the addition of bluff-side fencing around parks on Del Playa Drive should be included into the jurisdiction of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“What about adding fence maintenance as one of the powers? And then you would have control of that fence,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61298\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61298\" data-attachment-id=\"61298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/das-williams_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424816365\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61298\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2-683x1024.jpg?resize=327%2C491\" alt=\"(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"327\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould said the county should remain responsible for funding maintenance of the fences.</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to take that on,” Gould said. “IVRPD owns some of the parks.

This is so that we can keep the bill alive.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and IVRPD board member Paola De La Cruz said she is concerned about the proposed utility users tax, which would charge I.V. residents a percentage of their utility bills to fund services and could affect small households.</p>\n<p>“I live with one roommate. There’s only two of us but there is no gas; we only pay electricity,” De La Cruz said. “Our bill is a high amount, usually about $150 for electricity. The amount of money we would be paying compared to another house with five students is going to be higher.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the goal of the proposed utility user tax is to create a tax that is fairly distributed.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are having this discussion is to put the burden most fairly on the most amount of people,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board member Pegeen Soutar said a per-bedroom tax is preferable to a utility users tax to fairly divide the payment of local taxes.</p>\n<p>“Parks and Rec has a bedroom tax and that’s the majority of our funding, and it’s $94 a year, and that’s down by a two-thirds vote by taxpayers in the community,” Soutar said. “The landowners pay it, but in all reality that’s passed on by rent. I look at that as a very equitable way to place a tax.”</p>\n<p>According to De La Cruz, the stakeholders’ town hall meeting held last Saturday in Anisq’oyo’ Park was successful in including more students in the process of discussing self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I loved having it at the park,” De La Cruz said. “I saw some people I think were students just walking by and sitting out on the small hill just listening to conversations that were happening. I wish we would have had time for actual discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/","id":4740,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4739,4738,4737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Frat Chapter Closes Due to Alleged Misconduct","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Phi Sigma Kappa National Fraternity revoked UCSB fraternity Phi Sigma Kappa’s charter on Tuesday, and the fraternity will now be in consultation with the Office of Student Life.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Phi Sigma Kappa canceled the local charter  after allegations of university policy violations</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_61357\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61357\" data-attachment-id=\"61357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/phi-sig_paris-cullen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424882747\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Phi Sig\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61357\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Phi-Sig_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"The former fraternity house (pictured above).

Phi Sigma Kappa was placed on interim university suspension and was under investigation in late January due to alleged violations of university policy and conduct deemed inconsistent with the fraternity’s founding principles. The fraternity is the second Greek life organization to lose its charter campus since the academic year began, <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/beta-theta-pi-suspended-after-alcohol-incident/comment-page-1/\">with Beta Theta Pi losing its charter in December</a>.</p>\n<p>Inter-fraternity Council President Carl Provenzano said the closure of the chapter was an agreement between the university, alumni and the national organization.</p>\n<p>“The school follows the judgment of the national organization and no longer recognizes them on our campus,” Provenzano said in an email. “The investigation is over and the chapter has officially closed down.”</p>\n<p>According to Provenzano, while he believes members of the fraternity are constructive members of the community, the national chapter is concerned with the chapter’s multiple policy violations.</p>\n<p>“The men in Phi Sigma Kappa are a phenomenal group of guys,” Provenzano said in an email. “They are leaders on campus and in the community. Many of them are and will remain close friends of mine. Their national organization revoked their charter because they felt the local chapter was violating risk management policies and UCSB policy.”</p>\n<p>In a release sent out by Director of Fraternities and Sororities at the Office of Student Life Kristin Van Ramshorst, Phi Sigma Kappa has been revoked for participating in activities harmful to students as well as to new members of the fraternity.</p>\n<p>“Due to unsafe new member education practices and perpetuation of an unsafe environment for UCSB community members, the International Fraternity has deemed closure necessary to ensure the health and safety of their active and new members,” the release stated.</p>\n<p>Provenzano said he remains optimistic for the future of the Greek community despite several undesirable incidents this past year.</p>\n<p>“It has been a tough year for Greeks, but we are not going anywhere on this campus and wish to move in a more positive and upward direction in the coming years,” Provenzano said in an email.</p>\n<p>President of the Signet Housing Corporation Daryl Lu, who owns the property that formerly existed as the Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity house, said the chapter has been around for nearly five decades and has contributed positively to the campus community in the past.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Phi Sig chapter has been a positive member of the campus community, providing leadership in student government, the Interfraternity Council, and other campus organizations,” Lu said in an email. “The reputation that we earned and valued has been seriously damaged by the failure of the chapter to abide by our principles.”</p>\n<p>According to Lu, while actions taken to remove Sigma Kappa’s charter were necessary, he hopes other Greek organizations will not be affected by Phi Sigma Kappa’s suspension.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our fraternity, we apologize for conduct by some of the undergraduates that can unfairly cast a negative impression on other Greek organizations,” Lu said. “We know full well that fraternities and sororities, when operated consistent with their principles, play a highly constructive role in enriching the lives of their members.”</p>\n<p>Members of the fraternity refused to provide comment for this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/frat-chapter-closes-due-to-alleged-misconduct/","id":4741,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4740,4739,4738],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
