","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Beware the “Gang Fiesta.” Expect a post-apocalyptic city overrun by gang-bangers. Similar comments littered local message boards in the immediate aftermath of Judge Colleen Sterne’s decision to strike down the Santa Barbara gang injunction — a proposed mandate that would have curtailed the activities of those labeled as gang affiliates. </p>\n<p>It has been two months since Judge Sterne’s ruling and so far none of these predications have been fulfilled. </p>\n<p>Instead, police have identified and apprehended numerous perpetrators of gang crime by doing their jobs: investigating and attending to crime and crime reports. Just this past week, one of the principal leaders of the Sureños gang in Santa Barbara County, Raymond Macias, was sentenced to life without the opportunity for parole based on the combined investigative work of Santa Barbara, Lompoc and Santa Maria police departments. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It is just as easy, in hindsight, to laud a decision that has so far worked out as it is impossible to predict what the outcome will be when a decision must be made. And in the case of organized violence, fear certainly pushes the legislative inclination towards safety at any cost.</p>\n<p>The injunction trial featured examples of public intimidation worthy of a Ray Chandler novel, featuring the cryptically-labeled informant “Mister X,” who claimed the Mexican Mafia, La Eme, was laying low until the gang injunction was struck down. His implication: if the injunction was denied, all hell would break loose.<br>\nTo many, an increased police presence and additional sanctions sounds secure, the idea of “public defenders” guarding their constituents from harm seems like the right measure for those in danger. To protect the innocent, increase the guards and their punishing power. </p>\n<p>Except unlike opposing armies, the common threats to public safety dress like and are embedded in the social life of those who would be protected. Issuing restrictions against appearance and association fails to address any markers of criminality beyond the superficial, thereby creating appearance-based stereotypes that can contribute to unjustified profiling of innocent people. </p>\n<p>As was pointed out multiple times during the injunction trial, police have the tools to defend, and more importantly, work with a specific community. It is sweeping mandates like gang injunctions that help transition that role into the offensive, and into expectations of the police primarily as controllers instead of responders. The response seems reasonable in an area of constant, concentrated violence, but impractical and rife with collateral damage in a community like downtown SB. </p>\n<p>And neither of these roles, controller nor responder, fully meets the challenges posed by a human threat. Police are not robots for a reason. They have the proven capacity to build a dialogue with at-risk individuals, and work over time in an assigned area to prevent a potential threat from escalating into violence.<br>\nRecently, the group PODER (People Organized for the Defense and Equal Rights of SB Youth) has challenged police to respond to allegations of discrimination, and stated that some accused accept long jail sentences or unfair plea deals to avoid antagonizing police. </p>\n<p>Whether or not individual cases are the product of discrimination, the perception and dynamic of distrust do exist, have very real consequences and must be overcome. For many people, the reality is that they would rather forgo disputing convictions or avoid reporting a crime than challenge a system that can do just as much harm as it can good.</p>\n<p>In his closing remarks during the injunction trial, Deputy Public Defender Michael Hanley offered an apt opinion on the philosophy of the public defender, to protect with accountability and full, individualized attention, not to gloss over the rights of civilians and bend the scientific basis upon which injunctions must be crafted just to create the appearance of order. As Hanley stated, unnecessary requirements of police can result in “an iatrogenic effect, where the cure is worse than the disease itself.” </p>\n<p>Santa Barbara does harbor gang violence, it does contain belligerent college-age residents and, as I’ve learned in my commute on the 101, it contains a dangerous population of sports car owners who will risk all of our lives to swerve through commuters like a high-speed obstacle course. The individual policeman carries a burden of continuous adaptability and much of their training is uncompromising — take no chances, take every opportunity to stop crime before it happens.<br>\nBut I think what will be most beneficial for our communities, from the streets of Isla Vista to parks of the Eastside and Westside, is when individual police develop a stronger relationship with individual residents so that prevention takes its most useful form. The success of halting any kind of crime in its tracks largely depends on tips from the community, and a trust in police first as individuals. </p>\n<p>Efforts are already being made, and deserve more attention and participation from residents. Police Officer Adrian Gutierrez will soon begin a one-year local pilot of Gang Resistance Education and Training, G.R.E.A.T, a Department of Defense program effective since 1992.  A June 2012 analysis, supported by a grant from the National Institute of Justice and carried out by the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, reported a 39 percent reduction in odds of gang-joining among students who participated in the G.R.E.A.T. program compared to those who did not, and an average of 24 percent reduction in odds of gang-joining across four years after the program. </p>\n<p>I’ve had extensive experience working with children, including local kids at I.V. Elementary, and I know that kids are open to ideas and that they learn quickly from what they are taught. If they experience positive, diverse methods of support, such as those being championed by PODER downtown, and work with police to understand why people with a gold badge and gun deserve authority over their friends and neighbors who may also have guns, the lives of both police and community members will become gradually safer. </p>\n<p>This lesson carries over to the streets of Isla Vista, where violent assaults have been increasing in recent years. While no one can predict when a machete wielder will turn up in their house or a violent stranger will attack in the dark, increased dialogue between police and the people they serve would go a long way to relieving tensions on both sides. </p>\n<p>Police conferences such as Coffee with a Cop can provide the opportunity for residents to express their concerns and offer invaluable information on the activities police monitor. People who trust individual policemen would feel more comfortable going to report a violent assault or crime, hopefully decreasing the reliance on school intermediaries with an insufficient, or at least rather limited, understanding of the legal system and rights of victims. And when police understand the lives of those they serve, individual officers become better listeners, better responders and better informed about the very unique happenings of their local areas. </p>\n<p>Without the injunction, police are working on specific responses to various known gang activity, and are developing specific solutions to engage the children of these communities. Hopefully, this trend will increase in the coming year and community organizers and public defenders will be able to organize together to educate and learn from one another. </p>\n<p>Violence lurks around every corner, but the increase in the number and type of community events and in the activism of those who would like to see their surroundings change are better investments than sweeping one-sided responses. </p>\n<p>If I had not attended portions of the gang injunction trial and spoken to members of PODER and individual lawyers, I, too, might have thought of the rejected injunction as a lost opportunity.  I can’t stress enough the value of speaking with these different constituents of the complex communities we live in. While I believe many civilians do fear abuse of the law, too few are taking the opportunity to engage with their local law enforcement, many of whom are open to listen. </p>\n<p><em>Suzanne Becker is all about engagement — she’s engaging people left and right.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/individualization-to-avoid-criminalization/","id":5802,"author":{"id":429,"name":"Suzanne Becker"},"related":[5801,5800,5799],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":429,"name":"Suzanne Becker","biography":"Not available","articles":[5802],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Isla Vista: In Strength and  Solidarity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hanna Mendoza reflects on the IV community following the events of May 23.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>18,000 pained faces stare solemnly as the names of the deceased ring out across Harder Stadium: “George Chen, Cheng Yuan Hong, Weihan ‘David’ Wang, Veronika Weiss, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez.” Amidst the silence, there is only the barely audible click of press cameras. My skin prickles. This week, news vans took up residence on Pardall, Isla Vista’s main street, ready to capture a community that seems permanently caught between utopia and chaos. We seem to be the perfect paradox: a coastal paradise plucked straight from a movie set, yet marred with the crime rates of an inner-city ghetto. As UCSB students, we have slowly become desensitized to the ritual weekend emails that populate our inbox in the early hours. We reach for our phones and glaze over yet another police report; “Attempted robbery” blurs with “assault” and “suspected weapon”. To the outside world, we are a town of riots, tear gas, beached bodies and binge drinking.</p>\n<p>I understand that; it’s what makes the news. But this half-painted picture cannot be the only one we offer. When I arrived in California from London at age 19, the kindness of this community astounded me. It took me from a scared, lonely freshman thousands of miles away from home to a passionate advocate for our little town and all its beauty. Isla Vista has mystified me, taught me and inspired me beyond my wildest imagination.<br>\nMy mind leaves the stadium and wanders to the swaying eucalyptus groves that line the bluffs, their trailing leaves rustled by the warm afternoon wind.  They carry an unmistakable scent that any Isla Vistan will recognize: the earthy fragrance of bark mixed with ocean breeze and just a hint of oil. For many of us, it smells like home. \t</p>\n<p>A sea of students bob like seals in the glassy ocean, a movie scene that is nothing but another Tuesday afternoon in Isla Vista. There is beauty in this place and its people that can never be captured on cameras. They will never see us enter as wide-eyed freshmen, smitten with partying on Del Playa, but leave as activists, teachers, artists and entrepreneurs. They weren’t there as we swept broken glass from our streets after the riots, when we cleaned our beaches or raised $200,000 to save our local food co-op. We are so much more than the collective sum of our headlines.  We are nearly two square miles of passion, learning and growth. Our town is so compact that it sometimes seems we feel a collective heartbeat. Emotions spread through our neighborhood like an incoming tide; we laugh together, play together and mourn together. Now, more than ever, we must heal together. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sinking sun turns the ocean to liquid gold as hundreds of boards glide through the water, headed for the growing circle gathered for Wednesday’s Memorial Paddle-Out. I look around to see hundreds of my classmates bobbing beside me, hands interlinked in solidarity. We splash the water and chants echo to the open sky as we remember those we have lost. A feeling of unity flows through the vast circle like electricity. Saltwater mingles with tears and flowers arc the air, making rainbows on the ocean surface. Looking into the glowing faces of those around me, I have never felt so deeply connected to my fellow Gauchos.<br>\n“Now, turn to the person next to you and greet them,” the loudspeaker says. “Touch them, rub their hair, hug them.” I look around to see the ocean shift in a thousand embraces, and realize in this instant that our community is more powerful than I had ever imagined. I have never seen smiles more genuine, or felt hugs more sincere than in those moments, as the sun sets over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Right now, we may feel small and fragile after the actions of a few, of those who see our community only as something to be torn down. This week has taught me that the only power we have against these unstoppable forces is our kindness to one another, those actions that cost us nothing — the time we take to smile at strangers, listen with sincerity, show empathy and kindness to everyone who crosses our path. Days after the event that shook our town, a sense of fragility still fills the air, but it is tinged with something else, too. Now, words seem gentler, the smiles longer, the embraces tighter. </p>\n<p>On my way home from class, I gaze at the bullet holes peppering the glass of I.V. Deli, the site of Christopher’s shooting. Flower petals spread over and around these wounds, almost eclipsing the original scars in the window, and spill in the hundreds onto the sidewalk below. As we begin to recover, I can only hope that we don’t forget what this week has taught us. </p>\n<p>In the words of a banner tied to a house on Sabado Tarde, “What we do now is up to us.” Let us tread lightly on this beautiful patch of land we call home for four years.

Los Angeles has become a single slab of eternally rain-soaked skyscrapers, the only traces of color coming from gigantic, intelligent holographic advertisements. Apartment building hallways are cramped with the homeless and sick. Flying, heavily armed cars race across the sky as oppressive, electronic tones courtesy of Hans Zimmer blast in your ears. It tells you immediately that the world you see in front of you is oppressive, unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this neo-noir destitution, artificially created humans called “replicants” continue to be produced for slave labor. Specialized LAPD detectives called “blade runners” hunt down the older models, many of whom just want to be left alone.</p>\n<p>Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is one such “blade runner.” It quickly becomes clear that K is not a particularly remarkable person; he’s very robotic, stone-faced and unemotional. Although he occasionally questions the ethics of his job, he still carries it out, believing he has no choice in the matter. Even if the film doesn’t dig too deep into initial motivations, K still serves as the catalyst by which the film asks questions regarding the nature of the human and the artificial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For instance, take K’s holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas). Although copied and pasted from a mass-produced template and encoded onto a thumb drive for the sake of portability, Joi manages to demonstrate a degree of self-awareness. In a stroke of brevity and intelligence, the film never quite makes it clear if her growing independence evolved by itself or was programmed into her. Even though she has at least a small degree of freedom of movement, Joi yearns to overcome her existence as a mere product, seeking emotional fulfillment. I’m not familiar with Ana de Armas or her work, but I think she certainly has the chops to tackle more dramatic roles in the future if she so wishes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79204\" style=\"width: 1915px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1547592895\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79203\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79204\" data-attachment-id=\"79204\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/unnamed-46/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=1905%2C1288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1905,1288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?fit=888%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79204\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=888%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1905&amp;ssl=1 1905w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of the Movie Database</p></div>\n<p>This desire to be human, or to transcend it, is the thread holding the entire post-Ridley Scott tapestry together. What looks like a very bland story on paper — a cop uncovers a conspiracy with huge ramifications for society — delves into K’s past and forces him to ask himself questions about himself and what it all means for him and for the replicants. The movie continues the story from the original “Blade Runner” in a fascinating way that subversively pulls on tried-and-true sci-fi tropes.</p>\n<p>In the process of K’s investigation, we are introduced to Jared Leto in a role that allows him to spout the most forgettable philosophy babble I’ve heard since “Transcendence.” He’s the face behind the faceless entity that is corporate greed, and as antagonists go, he’s not up to snuff. He emotes very little and there is hardly any backstory present to flesh him out. His henchwoman Luv comes across as more complex, if perhaps a little contradictory. Perhaps, if you listen closely as Leto goes on about the nature of replicants in his silky tones, you might find yourself being lulled into a nap.</p>\n<p>On the flip side of Mr. ASMR, “2049” brings back original “Blade Runner” protagonist Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). While Deckard doesn’t show up until toward the end of the second act, he ties into K’s story in a fascinating, even subversive way that pulls from the events and consequences of the original film. Anyone looking to catch a bone regarding the long-persisting theory regarding whether or not Deckard’s a replicant isn’t going to find anything to gnaw on. It’s no longer his story to question the nature of humanity but instead the implications of it being able to evolve.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, the movie is not just a philosophical slog, I promise. You’re still going to get some shootouts and good ol’ robot fisticuff brawling. There’s entertainment to be had, but this isn’t joining the likes of “Fury Road” and “The Force Awakens” among the pantheon of 30-years-later blockbuster action sequels. “Blade Runner 2049” takes its time to get to its payoff — perhaps a little too much time. There’s so much excess that an entire subplot alluding to a replicant revolution goes absolutely nowhere. Sequel bait, perhaps? “Blade Runner 2079”?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blade-runner-2049-creates-a-new-future-from-the-same-story/","id":5800,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5799,5798,5797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Marshall’ Tackles Racism with Simplicity and Warmth","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its most basic plot summary, “Marshall” concerns two lawyers working a difficult case. NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall and insurance lawyer Sam Friedman are the defense in the case of Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur accused of the rape and attempted murder of his boss’s wife — who is white — in the 1940s segregationist America. The judge compounds the difficulty of their situation by ruling that Marshall cannot speak during the trial, justifying this by stating he’s an out-of-state lawyer.</p>\n<p>Genre-wise, the movie is a simple courtroom drama, reminiscent of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Marshall and Friedman consider all the evidence (or lack thereof) in order to try and prove that their client is innocent, while arguing in a court with a white judge, jury and prosecution. The odds are astronomically stacked against them, making this very much an underdog story.

Roger Durling, speaking at the screening hosted by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival Cinema Society, put it best: “They are allied by prejudice.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The two men’s partnership is initially tense. Friedman makes it clear that he is neither experienced enough nor happy to be the leading defensive attorney, and Marshall is very much frustrated at having to continually pester Friedman into defending Spell. As the film goes on and their friendship grows, the two wring some warm comedy out of one another, Marshall setting up one particularly rib-tickling joke about Friedman’s courtroom prowess.</p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman of “Black Panther” and Josh Gad play the two lawyers. According to director Reginald Hudlin, who spoke to Durling at the screening, Boseman was reluctant to take on another historical role after “42” and “Get on Up.” But after reading the script, he was on board to play the Supreme Court justice. He portrays Marshall with a weaponized, steely confidence that makes him immune to the prejudice he encounters. He’s unwilling to give up and bow down despite the daunting odds that he is confronted with. Nevertheless, he is still made vulnerable by tragedies that arise within his own family.</p>\n<p>Gad subtly makes it clear in his first scene, a small courtroom case, that Friedman feels unfulfilled and maybe even a little ashamed about being an insurance lawyer. When he has the opportunity to do some good, he is immediately concerned for his reputation and his family. As he and Marshall dig deeper into the case, Friedman becomes more involved both in Spell’s case and the greater issue of civil rights. Like Marshall, his own family must deal with personal tragedy, his own tied to the conquests of the Nazis.</p>\n<p>At times, though, the film to steers into melodrama. One hokey scene has Marshall stand on the steps of the courthouse and make a big speech about the Constitution to assembled reporters as dramatic music plays. It’s a little much, but the film brings the tone back around through Spell. Sterling K. Brown does a sublime job at playing a terrified man whose innocence is very much in question. His skin color is serving to continue to make his life a living hell. He makes this clear in court with an impassioned speech on what could happen to him as a black man, moving even the ambiguously racist judge (played by James Cromwell).</p>\n<p>The film is based on a true story, with heavy creative input from Friedman’s daughter (who portrays, ironically enough, a racist). As with many films like this one, it’s difficult to discern what is 100 percent true, but that does not take away from the film at all. At the film screening in the Riviera Theatre, Hudlin said he wanted to make a film that would make people come out and tell their friends, “Aw, that movie was so good!” and not “That movie’s really important, you gotta see it.”</p>\n<p>“Marshall” is entertaining, socially relevant and delivers doses of humor to balance out the gravity of the subject matter.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/marshall-tackles-racism-with-simplicity-and-warmth/","id":5801,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5800,5799,5798],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
