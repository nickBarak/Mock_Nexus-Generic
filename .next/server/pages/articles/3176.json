Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins led the Los Angeles and New Haven chapters of the Black Panther Party for 14 years after she originally joined in 1968, </span><a href=\"https://www.erickahuggins.com/bio\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to her website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was a </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Books/Cleaver.S.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seeking the liberation of all oppressed peoples by toppling capitalism, according to their former Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was known for its radical approach to organizing and meeting the material needs of Black and other oppressed groups with free breakfast and groceries programs, free clinics, political education and armed protection from police abuse according to </span><a href=\"https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/longmoreinstitute/bundles/230640\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former chairwoman of the Party Elaine Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexandra Gessesse, UCSB’s Black Student Union financial director, introduced Huggins that night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ericka Huggins taught herself to meditate as a means to survive incarceration … since then she incorporated spiritual practice into her community work and as a speaker and facilitator, teaching it as a tool for change,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins started off her lecture on the topic of having an “attitude of gratitude,” which over the years helped ease the pain of incarceration and being subjected to solitary confinement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you feel like a speck of pepper in a sea of rice, remember gratitude,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also served as her first of many motions for audience participation, asking those in attendance to reflect briefly on someone or something they are grateful for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins prefaced her later remarks on identity, activism and change by describing what it means to be aware of humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most all the isms — sexism, racism [and] classism — all of them are really not based in hatred. They look like they’re hateful, but they’re based in fear. Which is an irrational emotion for any of us to have.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins further posited that said “isms” aren’t to be attributed to individuals but to the institutions that manufacture and reproduce them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s structural … Remember that no one man or woman or group of men and women is responsible. It was here before they got here and before the ones before them,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins then segued into identity from these statements, pointing out the significance of coinciding identities existing in one body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we say my identity is human, which it is for all of us, there are other identities folded in … all in this one body,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are a man and a gay man, those are coinciding identities. If you are a man and you are heterosexual, [those are] coinciding identities. When the two men meet there could be some learning there … if our socialization didn’t get in the way of the two men talking, and that socialization teaches us to be fearful of what we don’t know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins transitioned into discussing activism, first by explaining what it meant to embody the essence of activism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Activism is what you do, how you participate in creating the transformation you want to see in this world. In other words it’s the dues you pay for taking up space on the planet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not a monolithic thing … [but] it needs to be a little bit beyond Facebook, okay,” said Huggins, joking with the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins, in between her humor, didn’t leave out the somber reality that can accompany activism, particularly of people like herself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe you think that an activist has to live the kind of life that I lived. You don’t want my life. I assure you. It’s not romantic. It’s not pretty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins spoke about change and transformation, noting her time in Upstate New York, learning from children who were researching the life cycle of a butterfly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t just change. They transform,” Huggins said a boy exclaimed to her at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins connected this anecdote to her and the Black Panther Party’s struggle for a transformation of society beyond the previous change achieved in the 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A change would be civil rights, which are the rights you are due by law … human rights, if they’re honored, would be the rights you are due by your very birth. That is transformation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins laced the concepts of identity, activism and change together by advising the audience to step outside of the boxes built up around them and rejecting those imposed upon others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whatever you were told about yourself and about others, if it doesn’t hold them up as fully human, you can let go of it … The universe won’t dissolve into the cosmos if we let go of some old, tired, whatever it is, but it’s important that we begin because freedom, is an inside job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few students after the lecture offered their thoughts on which passages resonated most with them, and discussed the connection to the current political climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish the talk was longer because every time I thought I knew something, her views on life told me different,” Aryn Jackson, a third-year communication major said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson related to Huggins’ belief that no one identity can fully explain the qualities of a person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nashelle Brown, a third-year film and media studies major, related the lecture to political polarization in the U.S. She pointed out that immense tension can impede change as well as the transformation that Huggins defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s favorite quote encapsulates Huggins’ lasting message of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of these privileges are anyone’s fault; it’s how we use it.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

The team’s total time of 3:39.68 marks Cunningham’s best as a pilot and represents a small sliver of the progressive personal growth that he has undergone since the start of his bobsled career in 2008.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a stepping stone to what I really want to accomplish overall in the sport … not only … to make a statement for myself and my team, but also to see where I stack up,” Cunningham said.</p>\n<p>On top of his experience gained from this past World Championship, Cunningham also had the joy of being able to witness fellow U.S. bobsledding pilot Steve Holcomb and his other USA-1 representatives capture the Olympic gold medal in both the two-and four-man bobsled races. In doing so, Holcomb became the first person in the history of the sport to finish first in every event he participated in.</p>\n<p>“I was actually their alternate when they won the gold medal back in 2009, so to … watch them ultimately come here and make history by winning the two- and four-man, which has never been done before, is just a really cool thing to watch,” Cunningham said. “It’s motivating to me because even though we’re all on different teams we’re all pretty close.”</p>\n<p>Although Cunningham didn’t place as high as he’d originally hoped, there’s no doubt in his mind that he’ll be back again next year, once again competing for another gold medal to add to his already extensive list of accolades.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely hungry now. I really wanted a top-10 finish … but that’s racing,” Cunningham said. “It won’t always work out there on race days, so I gotta get out there and get ready for the season and always try to get a little bit faster.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45093\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45093\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/","id":3173,"author":{"id":324,"name":"Joe Tapiro"},"related":[3172,3171,3170],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Seventh Wonder of the World","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a freshman at UCSB, Barbara Nwaba didn’t know what the heptathlon was.

I feel like it was meant to be.”</p>\n<p>In high school, the redshirt junior from University High School in Los Angeles participated in sprints, the high jump and hurdles. Even during her first season here at UCSB, Nwaba simply specialized in the hurdles. Yet, former Track and Field coach Josh Priester saw something more and began training Nwaba in her sophomore season for the heptathlon, a race that takes place over two days and involves seven events: the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw and 800 meter run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately, Nwaba took to the event. She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/","id":3174,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3173,3172,3171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Black History Month Book Pop-ups Come to UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/no-idea-who-this-is_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/no-idea-who-this-is_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For Solomon, the idea behind the pop-up goes back to one of the fundamental underpinnings of the university: the value of diversity.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many people, figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Frederick Douglass are household names; their work and efforts to better the lives of Black people in America are studied and revered in books, movies and other media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Zion Solomon, second-year history of public policy major, these narratives are far from the complete story of Black history.

Mingo provided suggestions for specific books and advised Jackson to consider a variety of genres and perspectives and to find books for the pop-up that represent each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I drew from books on my personal bookshelf, books I would want my students to read but we do not have space for them on the syllabus, books that are great introductions to nontraditional fields, books that can easily make must-read lists, and more,” Mingo said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Solomon and Amingo hope this year’s pop-up will be the beginning of a project that will resurface on campus in following years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope this will be the start of an annual opportunity for students to select books that they may not be familiar with, join in dialogue with others who also  select the same books, and extend their education beyond the classroom,” Mingo said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Solomon, the idea behind the pop-up goes back to one of the fundamental underpinnings of the university: the value of diversity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole purpose of being at a university this large and the whole purpose of diversity… [is that] people to learn something that might not have to do with their own understanding of life and like experience.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
