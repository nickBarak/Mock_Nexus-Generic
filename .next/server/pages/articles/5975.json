While most documentaries cast the big fish (whales, sharks, dolphins and the like) as their stars, “Secret Ocean 3D” gives the smaller organisms their chance to shine on the big screen.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Dr. Sylvia Earle, “Secret Ocean 3D” brings the audience up close and personal with some of the world’s most eerie and amazing creatures. Viewers, however, couldn’t appreciate these breathtaking scenes if it weren’t for the new filming tools utilized specifically for this documentary. Now, underwater shots can be made in 3D, Ultra-HD 4K, close up, macro and with motion control. “Secret Ocean 3D” takes full advantage of this technology and it certainly shows through the vibrant colors of the giant clam’s flesh, the smooth movements of the octopus, and the vivid colors of Christmas tree worms dotting the coral reefs.</p>\n<p>Cousteau’s mission, however, is not just to inform. In uncovering the wonders of the ocean, he also hopes to show why humans must be proactive in protecting the ocean. Take plankton, for example. It’s a crucial source of food to many marine animals and produces more than half the Oxygen on Earth. So almost every breath humans take is “a gift from the ocean.” By showing the enormous impact of such tiny organisms, Cousteau demonstrates not just the important role plankton plays in the ocean food chain but also why humans need the ocean as much as the ocean needs them.</p>\n<p>The screening was followed by a panel discussion with the Cousteau family moderated by Tim Matheson. Jean-Michel spoke fondly of his relationship with his father who strapped an Aqua-lung on his back at the age of seven and pushed him overboard into the water. That event soon spurred into family scuba diving in the Mediterranean sea, many adventures on board the ship, <em>Calypso</em>, and of course Jean-Michel’s legacy in ocean exploration. Even after creating countless films and publishing a best-selling autobiography about his father, <em>My Father, My Captain, </em>there’s one thing that continues to keep Jean-Michel excited about his commitment to saving the oceans.</p>\n<p>“Every time I have the opportunity to look in the eyes of a child, I always say ‘I will never let you down because I want you to have the same privilege as I’ve had. And thus we need to do everything we can to protect our life support system and that’s the message I’ve been trying to pass on. Fortunately it has impacted those two there,” said Jean-Michel, gesturing to Celine and Fabien.</p>\n<p>Celine has a different approach in ocean conservation and spoke about her work regarding the indigenous tribes of the Vale do Javari reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, illegal activities and oil exploitation have negatively impacted the tribes and help contribute to their enormous health crisis. But through multi-media content such as film and photography, she hopes to be able to bring awareness to such people and educate others on their changes they can make to better conserve the environment.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s very important to put the human being at the center of every story. That’s how you connect to a wider audience and have them understand their connection to any place, ecosystem, or issue.”</p>\n<p>Fabien, for his part, strives to showcase ocean exploration as an adventure through a project called Mission 31. For 31 days, Fabien and his team lived in an underwater habitat, exploring the ocean at 63 feet below the surface as well as connecting such discoveries with the world.</p>\n<p>“For the first time ever we invited the world to live at the bottom of the sea. We did Skype with classrooms and Google hangouts and were able to share a lot of the discoveries that were happening in real time. It was really important to tell the story in a more immersive way, pun intended, in a way that can have young generations dream.”</p>\n<p>The work of the Cousteau family has expanded over three generations and though Jean-Michel, Celine and Fabien have accomplished much in their lives, there is still work to be done. Pollutants, climate change and overconsumption have negatively impacted our environment but there is still hope. And the first step in making a change is education and awareness.</p>\n<p>“This is our life support system and why we exist,” Jean-Michel said. “If we protect the ocean, we protect ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/cousteau-family-honored-with-the-attenborough-award-secret-ocean-3d-grants-cousteau-excellence-in-nature-filmmaking-award/","id":5975,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5974,5973,5972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"SJP — Students Justifiably Perplexed","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Omri Rahmil presents his concern with the conversations regarding Palestine.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last weekend, another group calling itself SJP — Students for Justice in Palestine — spent three days on the Stanford campus at a conference they said would “create space for a critical discussion on solidarity.”</p>\n<p>We felt that this was an important goal and expected SJP members to stand with Palestinians who are in favor of peace with Israel. Such pro-peace Palestinians need all the help they can get, because the two Palestinian governments in power today refuse to accept the principle of “two states for two peoples.” In Gaza, Hamas rules with an iron fist and continues to prepare for war against Israel. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ four-year term expired in 2009, but he has refused to hold new elections. And In both places, Palestinian security forces intimidate and jail dissidents who criticize their leaders.</p>\n<p>We studied the SJP conference program. None of the Palestinian governments’ human rights violations were mentioned. Instead, the program was filled with euphemisms about the importance of destroying Israel, the most progressive state in the Middle East. Is this what it means to stand in solidarity with Palestine?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, oppressed peoples are in great need of support: Women who want to drive in Saudi Arabia, anti-theocratic bloggers in Iran, Christians in Egypt and even Palestinians fleeing the civil war in Syria.

Essentially, what I’ve gathered is that over the years, this institution has moved further and further away from what it was designed to provide — top quality, accessible higher education. The ambition and application of this mission was primarily the vision of Clark Kerr, the legendary President of the UC system. Kerr’s plan was formulated during the 1950s and 60s, a time in which California was plagued by issues of an inefficient tax system, significant state budget issues and a worrying disconnect between accessibility and enrollment demand; a time quite interestingly enough that eerily mirrors our own.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference between that golden age of California higher education and our time however, is in the manner in which our state is dealing with the problem. Whereas the decision-process regarding fixing higher education once involved those actually experienced with matters of higher education, it appears that currently we would rather choose to outsource our problem solving to those who have never been the problem solving type. This is why it is particularly disheartening that a few weeks ago our own Associated Students Senate chose to shoot down a vote of “no confidence” for our newest appointed President of the UC system, Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>The decision ties in to our institution’s recent history and degradation of its original master plan on two fronts. First, it is quite clear that Napolitano’s experience as former head of the Department of Homeland Security, where she gained a knack for deporting individuals and being in the good graces of the National Security Agency, makes her more fitting for administrating a nuclear facility than a widely respected hub of intellectual thought. Ironically, the baby-boomer laden committee appointed to select the UC president used this reasoning to explain why she was the perfect candidate when it rolled out the red carpet for Napolitano in its initial publicity blitz. Her obvious lack of experience in the field of education should be a huge red flag to us as students.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A far cry from the days of Kerr, it is evident that we now have a figurehead happier to manage whatever facilities continue to prop up the military-industrial complex than an intellectual leader with the appropriate scholastically-minded vision. With this kind of leader, we will have another 30 years of the status quo, and this university will remain a 20th century institution readying kids for a 21st century world. Regardless of what opinion you might have when it comes to the safety of undocumented students at our university as the recently failed resolution contended, a student of this university should disagree with a Napolitano reign on principle alone.</p>\n<p>Second, it is clear as daylight that the process is wholly undemocratic, and an insult to the people who as of a few years ago pump more money into the university system than our own state does. The appointment of Napolitano was approved by the UC Regents in a vote that went 25-1, with the lone dissenting voice coming from our only student representation on the board. The vote is an outright misrepresentation of the people the Regents are supposed to represent.</p>\n<p>It shouldn’t be a shocker, though. The Regents often have little to no experience in education themselves and usually end up being mere cronies to the Governor of California. This approach has failed, and it has failed hard. Clark Kerr himself was ousted by Regents handpicked by then-new Governor Ronald Reagan who was exceptionally frightened by the increasingly liberal movements of free speech and thought, or what I’d like to call “education,” going on at UC campuses across the state. Regents nowadays are obviously not much better because the cronies have only sat by while our schools become privatized and flooded by those with extraordinary means.</p>\n<p>Again, it is quite disheartening that our own Senate, made up of students like you and I, would reject a vote of no confidence on the basis of good faith in our new leader’s abilities to meet our demands and expectations of higher education, when its clear that we have been losing ground and selling out to the highest bidder with the weakest spine for decades. Ultimately, we must ask ourselves if we are willing to cease being the children of Ronald Reagan. Can we instead take charge of our university to fulfill the destiny spread out by Clark Kerr all those years ago? We have the numbers, we have the ideas and perhaps one day we’ll have the student leaders with the will to actually change things.</p>\n<p><em>Mario Vasquez is a fourth-year history major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I sat there looking down at the greatest poetry of the 20th century and I was being asked to fill in the blanks. Percy Shelley claimed: “Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration … Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” Whilst international relations students may raise an eyebrow to that, you can imagine my disappointment that their work was being reduced to some kind of verbal coloring exercise.</p>\n<p>This is by no means an attack on the professors who set the exams but rather the system that forces them to condescend to question whether we have actually read the material they set. The problem with midterms is that they’re clearly not designed to test whether you’ve engaged with what’s been taught. Rather, midterms are constructed to instill just enough fear in the girl sitting in the back row to drag her attention away from a text from the guy “who’s like super cute and totally flirted with her at the last  date night,” so she can make a quick note on what free indirect speech means. They’re created to get the guy, who spends most days high as kite, off the sofa for half an hour so he can hastily copy down what a neurotransmitter does from the girl who’s sitting next to him.</p>\n<p>Realistically, midterms are for the kids who only went to university because mummy and daddy told them to. Why else would you see more people in the class on the day of the midterm than any other? Lack of attendance certainly isn’t an act of rebellion, otherwise they wouldn’t care about the grades.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Why can’t universities recognize that these people are the exceptions, not the rule?
