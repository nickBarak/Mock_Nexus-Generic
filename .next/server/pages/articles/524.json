That’s what separates the Miami Heat from NBA lore.</p>\n<p>When LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh came together in the summer of 2010 they had in mind winning more than one championship. To put it in James’ words, “Not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven.” That was the expectation the Heat came in with after the “Big Three” first formed.</p>\n<p>Four years later, Miami is in position to win its third consecutive title.

With three titles, that puts them in the same playing field as Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker’s Spurs and Larry Bird’s great Celtics teams. Those teams won three titles each.</p>\n<p>However, for the Heat to enter the upper echelon of dynasties would mean equating them with teams that revolutionized the game. Bill Russell’s Celtics, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Lakers and Michael Jordan’s Bulls all fall under this elite category. The Minneapolis Lakers of the early 1950s led by George Mikan also deserves a spot in this class.</p>\n<p>Consider that these teams all won at least four titles, played against formidable competition and dominated the game.</p>\n<p>Jordan three-peated twice and if he hadn’t decided to take a two-year break from the game, the Bulls would most likely have won eight straight titles.</p>\n<p>Not only did Chicago win each time they reached the Finals, none of the series were pushed to a game seven. LeBron and Co. lost in their first appearance and if it wasn’t for an incredibly clutch three-point shot from</p>\n<p>Ray Allen, last year’s Finals wouldn’t even have gone to a deciding game seven.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the topic of who Miami has faced in the championship round. In 2012, the Heat played against a young and inexperienced Oklahoma City squad that was not ready to take the crown just yet.</p>\n<p>Last year, a game seven proved to be too much for an aging Spurs team. Going against Kevin Durant before this year or Duncan past his prime does not cut it when talking about all-time great dynasties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Showtime Lakers had to go through the legendary Celtics teams led by Bird. Those games pitted two opponents who had the same caliber of talent and saved the NBA from going extinct. The</p>\n<p>Johnson-Bird rivalry increased interest of the NBA and brought a new generation of fans to the game.</p>\n<p>Russell had his own rival in Wilt Chamberlain and Jordan went toe-to-toe with the two-headed monster of Karl Malone and John Stockton twice. James is the best player in the league, but there is no equivalent for him to prove his mettle.</p>\n<p>The Heat are also not on par with the dominance achieved with teams that came before. Minneapolis, the league’s first dynasty, won five championships in six years. Boston failed to win a title just once during the 1960s. That ladies and gentlemen, is dominance. The Heat are good, but not that good.</p>\n<p>And if you had to pick one coach to draw up the last play with the game on the line, would you have Erik Spoelstra design the play, or hand things over to Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson? The championship rings on those coach’s fingers can answer that question. Auerbach won nine times and Jackson ran out of fingers to show off his rings.</p>\n<p>If the Heat win it this year they deserve to be ranked higher than other mini-dynasties such as the Houston Rockets of the mid 1990s or the Detroit Pistons of the Bad Boy era. Their name probably is on the same plateau as Bird’s Celtics and Kobe and Shaq’s L.A. teams. However, to enter legendary status and be considered the greatest, Miami will have to win, “not three, not four, not six, not seven.” Only time will tell if that happens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55447\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55447\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/","id":524,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[523,522,521],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB-Cal Poly Showdown Set for Tomorrow","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos take on the Mustangs on senior day","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The makings for a storybook ending are set for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It will be senior day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos can also clinch the eighth and final playoff spot with a victory. A season where Santa Barbara has struggled, a win would send UCSB into the Big West Tournament with momentum.</p>\n<p>And to top it all off, the Gauchos are facing rival Cal Poly, a team Head Coach Mitchell has yet to beat since arriving in Santa Barbara almost three years ago. Only the three seniors know the feeling of winning a Blue-Green rivalry game as they beat the Mustangs March 5, 2011 to become co-champions of the Big West.</p>\n<p>Now all the team has to do is win.</p>\n<p>“These players dictate if we’re going to have five games,” Mitchell said. “They have to know that myself and this coaching staff believe as we have from day one. It has to be a positive energy going into Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>But beating Cal Poly is much more easily said than done.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tomorrow’s game the underdog with an overall record of 8-20 and a conference mark of 3-12. The Gauchos hold a one-game lead over UC Riverside, which plays Long Beach in its final game. The first time those two teams played, the Highlanders lost 65-52.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly, on the other hand, comes to the Thunderdome in a tie for second place in the Big West standings at 16-12 overall and 10-5 in conference. While the Mustangs seemed invincible to start the season, they have struggled of late, losing four of their last six.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will also be well-rested since it had a buy yesterday. Santa Barbara, however, will have to bounce back quickly from a red-eye flight home after a 73-60 loss in Hawaii last night. The Gauchos were outrebounded 38-25, including 17-8 on the offensive boards, which resulted in a 25-7 second chance points disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch always tells us after a loss, ‘you have until midnight and then you have to forget about it and move on to the next one,’” Zornig said. “We just have to forget about this one and go in ready to play. Cal Poly is a good team and they’re our rivals, so it’s about time we get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will once again be crucial tomorrow. Not only is it the biggest statistical difference in the win-loss column for the Gauchos, but the Mustangs lead the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 44.4 per game. UCSB ranks last at 34.0 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Yet, before Santa Barbara can rebound, it will have to play solid defense and force Cal Poly into some bad shots. A team that wins on the offensive end, the Mustangs top the conference in scoring at 77.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s biggest target offensively is last year’s Big West Player of the year Molly Schlemer. The senior center averages 17.3 points per game, leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 55.2 percent and ranks second in rebounding, pulling down 10.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Clearing out the middle for Schlemer is three-point threat and junior guard Ariana Elegado. Elegado ranks right behind Schlemer in scoring in the Big West, putting up a fifth-best 16.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest key will be our defense,” Zornig said. “They have Schlemer inside, who’s a beast in there, and then they have really good outside shooters, so we just have to have a lot of communication on defense.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in San Luis Obispo for the first Big West game of the year, the Mustangs were victorious thanks to their star duo. Schemer scored a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting along with 15 rebounds while Elegado hit big threes for Cal Poly, recording 30 points. Combining for 67 points, Schlemer and Elegado tallied just three points less than the entire UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>Trying to slow down the 6’5’’ Schlemer inside will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins. Although Watkins struggled in Hawaii, she is a very different player than when Cal Poly last saw her. Before the Hawaii game, Watkins had caught fire, averaging a double-double in the three previous games.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re better than the first time we played them, but we will use any combination of defenses we need to to hopefully limit [Schlemer],” Mitchell said. “But it’s not a one player show. They have great guards.

For Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, however, it metaphorically meant something more, something positive for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On a team dominated by seniors, it showed the reins of the team being passed to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“I kind of liked at the end of the year meeting [talking to her about how] even though we didn’t call the last play to have the ball in her hands in our last game against Davis, she wanted it,” Mitchell said. “That tells me a lot about her drive, and it’s only going to fuel her to work harder.”</p>\n<p>Named to the Big West All-Freshman team, Jemerigbe played well beyond her years this season. She quickly became a staple in Santa Barbara’s starting lineup, playing the most minutes behind the three seniors.</p>\n<p>In fact, after starting 26 of UCSB’s 30 games, Jemerigbe became the first freshman to start more than 20 games since La Shay Fears in 2005-06 and just the fourth in the past 14 years, joining elite company in Kristen Mann and Mia Fischer, as well as Fears.</p>\n<p>“I remember when we told her we were going to start her. I go, ‘Are you nervous?’ And I can remember her looking at me and she was like, ‘Yeah. I’m really nervous.’” Mitchell said. “But she never looked back after that. She’s so competitive, she wants to win and she knows how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe made her biggest impact on the defensive end. Although listed at just 5’5’’, Jemerigbe used her speed and quickness to hassle opponents on all 4,700 square feet of the court, ranking second on the team in steals at 1.1 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos something it hasn’t seen in many years: a true point guard. With her pass first, shoot second mentality, Jemerigbe registered 67 assists this season, which ranks eighth all-time amongst UCSB freshmen.</p>\n<p>“She exceeded what I knew she had ability-wise,” Mitchell said. “We knew the natural God-given ability, but her understanding of the game and competitive spirit were far greater than I anticipated. I think she had an outstanding freshman year.”</p>\n<p>While Jemerigbe’s ability to adapt to college basketball could easily be attributed to her time at UCSB, Mitchell acknowledged other sources for the freshman’s transition, including one much closer to home.</p>\n<p>The Stockton, California native is the youngest of four children, all of whom are involved in sports. One family member in particular has made the biggest influence on Jemerigbe, her older sister Afure.</p>\n<p>“[Afure] knows the whole DI, student-athlete life, so she’s my biggest role model,” Jemerigbe said. “She gives me so much advice. It’s cool having somebody older who’s already been through it and can guide me through it. Even though she’s not here, I can still talk to her over the phone and text. She’s always giving me advice and encouraging me.”</p>\n<p>Afure Jemerigbe is currently a senior at Berkeley and a star on Cal’s women’s basketball team. Playing a shooting guard, Afure started all 32 games for the Golden Bears, serving as one of the team’s biggest three-point threats. She averaged 12.1 points per game this season.</p>\n<p>“[Onome’s] one of those that watches and evaluates. I think she was able to watch Afure,” Mitchell said. “I think any time you have an example of older siblings or family members that have been successful at the college level and you’ve seen their ups and downs and what they had to go through, it gave her a head start on the mindset she needed to play at this level.”</p>\n<p>With a three-year age difference, the Jemerigbe sisters played together at St. Mary’s High School in the 2009-10 season, which only aided the young Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“It was so much fun,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s like my best friend, so it was no drama; it was all fun. She would encourage me when I got on the court and tell me what I needed to work on.”</p>\n<p>Now, Jemerigbe will try to take a page out of her older sister’s book on the offensive end. Seniors Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the Gauchos’ scoring this season.</p>\n<p>As a natural distributor, Jemerigbe averaged just 5.8 points this year, although she proved she could produce at the rim for herself too, scoring in double figures in five games. In the next few years, Mitchell will ask for more.</p>\n<p>“Nic, Mel and Destini aren’t going to be there next year, so I have to pick it up a lot more that they’re gone,” Jemerigbe said. “I need to be more of a leader. That’s what we lack the most right now since they were our leading scorers.”</p>\n<p>And with all three seniors playing the guard position, Jemerigbe will also become the guard with the most experience and be asked to lead her team. Even as a freshman, Jemerigbe showed she could lead by example, but now, her team will look for its point guard to be the floor general.</p>\n<p>“With a year under her belt, I think she had already led by example in her work ethic and competitive spirit, but now she’ll add that element of being a little more vocal,” Mitchell said. “She’s a starter and an all-freshman team player and she earned that right by working hard every day. Being a starter, she knows the expectations and the returners will hopefully follow her lead and continue to get better every day. As long as O continues to work, we’ll keep the ball in her hands.”</p>\n<p>So next year, don’t be surprised if Mitchell designs the last-second play for Jemerigbe. Her point guard will be ready.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54724\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54724\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-pass-the-torch/","id":522,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[521,520,519],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Draft Lottery: Cavaliers Luck out on Number One Pick Once Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CAVS-2.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CAVS-2.gif?resize=750%2C328&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Daniel Moebus-Bowles discusses what will happen next for NBA teams now that the draft order has been set.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I shouldn’t have to say this, but let’s give a warm and sarcastic congratulations to Cleveland. The Cavaliers have now won the number one overall pick two years in a row and in three out of the last four years. On top of that, they had the fourth pick in both 2011 and 2012. To put it simply, if the Cavs start the player that they get in this year’s draft, their entire first unit would be made up of top-five athletes.</p>\n<p>So, besides the rest of the NBA being bent over from this lottery outcome, what does this pick mean? It means the Cavs have another chance to either grab a good player like Kyrie Irving, or completely embarrass themselves again.</p>\n<p>I’m sure we all remember the players they passed up in recent years such as Damian Lillard, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker and Klay Thompson, just to name a few. Instead, the team lucked out and drafted the incredible Tristan Thompson and amazing Anthony Bennett. Along with those great moves, they signed/dropped Andrew Bynum and traded big for Luol Deng, who is now a free agent. All while failing to make theplayoffs since King James left.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lucky enough for the Cavs, this draft is possibly more stacked than the 2003 draft which consisted of Miami’s big three and Carmelo Anthony. What this means is that if Cleveland decides to keep its pick, it will be pretty hard to take another bust with all these promising young players to choose from.</p>\n<p>Everyone from random enthusiasts to big time analysts are saying that the number one overall pick in this draft will be Kansas’s Andrew Wiggins, but in my opinion, that’s their third best option.</p>\n<p>Wiggins is a good player without a doubt, but his subpar college performance showed his youth and inexperience at the next level. In addition to that, he isn’t the greatest fit into the system of the Cavaliers, especially if Deng were to stay.</p>\n<p>The team’s second best option would be to take Joel Embiid or Jabari Parker. The Cavs struggle at both the SF and C positions on both sides of the ball. Parker would help offensively, which the team needs as it was 22nd in scoring last year, but he could be a burden on defense.</p>\n<p>Embiid could prove to be a huge help on defense as long as the seven-footer works on his speed a bit. He averaged 2.6 blocks last year and played excellent post defense to go with it. Joel is the best pick for the Cavs if they decide to draft, but trading this pick would truly be the most effective.</p>\n<p>Minnesota knows Kevin Love is leaving next year and they’re looking for a deal. The Cavs could consider bundling the pick and possibly Dion Waiters to bring in K-Love, which would surely draw Deng back in as well. Kyrie, Deng, Love, and two top picks sound good to me. Maybe that will break the King James curse.</p>\n<p>Now, it is annoying that Cleveland received the top pick again, but with the talent in this draft, other teams shouldn’t hang their heads by any means. In fact, the team that should be the most excited is the Philadelphia 76ers, who have the third pick.</p>\n<p>With the two Jayhawks probably going first, Philly will likely have the option of Coach K’s Jabari Parker, who can easily complement the team. He would join reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams (another player whom Cleveland passed up) and Nerlens Noel, who will make his real debut this year. This young combination will ensure they never have another terrible slide like they did in the second half of last season.</p>\n<p>Another pair of teams that can strive if they play their cards right are the Lakers and Celtics. These two rivals can work together to make a blockbuster trade with their 6th and 7th picks. The Celtics could help build their franchise by adding a veteran in like Kevin Love in exchange for their pick as well as dish Rajon Rondo to the Lakers for their pick.</p>\n<p>The Celtics would receive an all-star and likely draft Marcus Smart and the Lakers would receive Rondo who helps them in their “win now” situation. With Kobe being re-signed, it’s clear they aren’t trying to build with an incoming rookie. If neither team were to trade, they could still be looking at drafting Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle and Smart, who would best fit both teams.</p>\n<p>The team that undoubtedly got burned the most was the Detroit Pistons. In a trade with the Bobcats a few years ago, Detroit received a minimally protected first round pick in this year’s draft. This meant that if the Pistons got a top-eight pick, they could keep it for themselves, and if they didn’t, it would belong to Charlotte. The Pistons received the 9th pick on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>This draft will definitely be one for the league to remember and although things may seem bad for your team now, don’t worry yourself in the slightest. This is the NBA Draft — we never know what insanity is going to unfold.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of </em>www.sportslogos.net<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/nba-draft-lottery-cavaliers-luck-out-on-number-one-pick-once-again/","id":523,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[522,521,520],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
