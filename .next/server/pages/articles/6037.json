In a world of willful ignorance and denial, scientific evidence and conclusions are often neglected or unreasonably disputed. Greater dissemination of scientific research is needed across all religious and political beliefs. Political groups in particular have an agenda, and scientific evidence is frequently dismissed in support of the group’s goals.</p>\n<p>To be sure, some of my most admired and appreciated science professors are likely theistic, while others are likely atheistic. I don’t know their beliefs for certain, because they are professional scientists and teachers foremost and they keep their personal beliefs private. Science does not need to rely solely on atheists as its champions. I know many exceptional scientists who are likely theistic — they synthesize their religious and scientific views, and they advocate careful, unbiased science.</p>\n<p>I truly hope that more people, irrespective of belief or political opinion, will continue to learn from science, advocate good science and yet remain healthily skeptical. Especially in politics, scientific evidence is often reduced to mere opinion, which is incredibly dangerous. This extreme polarization and ignorance span all political and religious spectra. Luckily, advocates and practitioners of good science also comprise a variety of religious and political beliefs. We just need more of them, along with a better-educated populace.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found)

whiskey sours while a crowd of Gauchos dance their faces off to “I don’t give a f*ck,” the latest ramble of sophistication from Big Sean to bless this college campus. No, this didn’t actually happen, but who knows what the very near future will hold — because it just so happens that Aniston, Carell and Redmayne will be hanging out on State Street, coming to claim their awards as victors in the 2015 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>SBIFF is the 12 days out of the year when State Street is inundated with movie stars and paparazzi, when the red carpet rolls out in front of the Arlington Theater and limousines arrive in hordes like freshmen at a fraternity party. Never-before-seen films debut at one of the seven theaters downtown, with categories including shorts, features, documentaries and the delectably titled “screen cuisine.”</p>\n<p>Post-screening galas are accompanied by Santa Ynez Valley wine, and directors from all over the world swap stories with each other (and lucky Artsweek reporters). Competitions abound, with films from the eastern bloc, Spanish/Latin America and social justice realms going head-to-head for the win. Writers, producers and women from all stages of film production hold panel discussions for aspiring actors and anyone who happens to walk in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2015 marks applause-worthy celebrity award ceremonies for SBIFF, with Michael Keaton (“Birdman”), Logan Lerman (“Fury”), Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”) and Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”) all in attendance.

Lin is an antisocial nerd. Yeh carries a tough-guy facade. The three teens have nothing in common until the death of fellow student Hsia Wei-chiao provides a chance encounter for the boys to meet. Though it is ruled a suicide, the boys’ nagging suspicion propels them to embark on a mission to uncover the true cause of her death.</p>\n<p>As lies are told and secrets are revealed, the Taiwanese film “Partners in Crime” exposes what it means to be a teenager: students are more than just typical high school archetypes, restlessness and loneliness dominate youthful crises. The film also delves into the impact that one-word responses from adults who don’t understand can have. In this compelling mystery thriller, director Chang Jung-chi brings to light the truths of a girl’s death and the reality of the teenage character.</p>\n<p>“Partners in Crime” will be screened on Jan. 28, Feb. 1 and Feb. 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FNbN6dSENA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>When you spend 12 years of your life making one film, you’re going to get some kind of award. It’s just a fact of life.</p>\n<p>Although they actually didn’t work on Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” for <em>that </em>long (just a few weeks every year), Patricia Arquette and regular Linklater-collaborator Ethan Hawke are rightfully receiving the American Riviera Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The two portray the parents of protagonist Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane). Each parent is layered and unique in their own ways. Arquette portrays Olivia Evans, a woman who manages to raise two children and become a professor despite being a single mother and enduring a slew of doomed marriages, one of which was abusive.</p>\n<p>Hawke’s turn as Mason Evans Sr. is equally powerful. He’s fun, holds strong beliefs and occasionally shows some irresponsibility, but like Olivia, his love for his children never wavers. The two actors’ portrayals are both subtle and powerful, never screaming “love me!”, but allowing the audience to see them for who they are: two people. In “Boyhood,” you don’t see Hawke and Arquette playing roles, you see Olivia and Mason Evans, separated parents who grow up just as much as their kids.</p>\n<p>For their fantastic performances, the two will be the first pair of actors to jointly receive the American Riviera Award at the Arlington Theater on State Street on Feb. 5.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0oX0xiwOv8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars”</p>\n<p>Bin Nguyen, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is a dark, fantasy-reality-themed, satirical look on the sexy, yet dangerous world of Hollywood. Starring Academy Award Nominee Julianne Moore and “Twilight” vampire Robert Pattinson, the film focuses on the turbulent, crazy life of a Hollywood actress (Moore) and her personal chauffeur (Pattinson). Her psychotic assistant, played by Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” star Mia Wasikowska, may or may not have a troubling obsession with Moore.</p>\n<p>Using Hollywood as its personal backdrop, “Maps to the Stars” entails all the elements that a good movie needs — drama, sex and suspense. Known in the horror movie genre, director David Cronenberg often incorporates themes of personal transformation in the physicality and emotional aspects of his characters. The movie appears to have all those key qualities; good characters aren’t always good and bad characters aren’t always bad.</p>\n<p>Judging from the film’s trailer, “Maps to the Stars” is a nonstop ride of events that could result in cringe-worthy moments for the audience. While one must need to see the film to appreciate its entire glory, its most notable award being Moore’s Best Actress win at the glamorous Cannes Film Festival in France. “Map to the Stars” is finally making its debut at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and Artsweek suggests you watch it to observe the nonexistence of the famous red mane on Moore’s head, if for nothing else. Yep. Iconic ginger Julianne Moore has turned blonde.</p>\n<p>“Maps to the Stars” is showing Feb. 5-7.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIpD7V4cG9c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston</p>\n<p>Nadine Bedwan, <em>staff writer </em></p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston skyrocketed to fame during her time as Rachel Green on “Friends”<em>,</em> when her great hair and bubbly personality stole the nation’s (and world’s) heart. Since then she’s managed to maintain her superstar status through great hair and playing the lead in countless romantic comedies. That isn’t to say Aniston has limited talent — her growing repertoire alone proves she’s a great actress.</p>\n<p>That being said, the seasoned star is now ready to showcase her skill in a new type of role. In Daniel Barnz’s “Cake<em>,</em>” released in late 2014, she stars alongside Anna Kendrick and William H. Macy as a dressed-down and gritty version of herself, a costume she’s never worn before. Aside from the physical difference, this film allows Aniston to portray a character dealing with emotional and physical health issues within a darker plot.</p>\n<p>“Cake” follows Aniston as she becomes obsessed with the suicide of a woman in her support group, while simultaneously dealing with her own deep conflicts. The movie promises to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey, and it will undeniably be interesting to watch the beloved actress transfer her gifts to a different type of film.</p>\n<p>Aniston will be honored with the Montecito Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Jan. 30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3IsUOSHlnU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Wet Bum”</p>\n<p>Jane Huson, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>First-time feature filmmaker Lindsay MacKay masterfully portrays the troubling teenage years of 14-year-old Sam (Julia Sarah Stone) in “Wet Bum.” Not yet physically matured into a “full woman,” Sam is mercilessly mocked for her physical attributes, or lack thereof, by her peers. Ignored and cast aside at school, Sam is forced by her mother to work at the senior assisted living home she manages. There she develops relationships with two residents in particular – Judith (Diana Leblanc), a silent woman who gives attention exclusively to Sam and Ed (Kenneth Welsh), a curmudgeon who often attempts to escape to mysterious places.</p>\n<p>As she grows closer to these disgruntled old-timers, Sam experiences hardship and enlightenment far beyond her years. “Wet Bum” features all the fears and follies you would expect from a coming-of-age story with a wise authenticity that can only be attributed to its youthful director and star. “Wet Bum” will be screened on Jan. 28-30.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8Rq78ZJfMo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Steve Carell</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung, <em>staff writer</em></p>\n<p>He has been the 40-Year-Old Virgin, Michael Scott, Maxwell Smart, Brick Tamland, Evan Almighty and Burt Wonderstone. All of these roles have been intended to make audiences laugh, but in “Foxcatcher,” Steve Carell defied expectations and completely immersed himself in the role of John du Pont, a real-life wrestling enthusiast whose unsatisfactory life and touch with insanity destroyed his own life and the lives of others as well. For this metamorphic, shocking and career-defining performance, Carell will receive the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>In “Foxcatcher,” Carell is nigh-unrecognizable as du Pont. The manic, smiling, loud energy with which he utilized in his more famous roles, such as in “The Office” and “Anchorman” are gone. In their stead is a somber, downplayed personality, feelings ranging from torn sadness to brimming rage and noticeable mouth breathing, all coming together to recreate a man who emanates a sense of perverse uneasiness. Carell’s performance clearly portrays a very disturbed man and he does it so extremely well that all other actors in the film (including Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) pale in comparison.</p>\n<p>Carell will be awarded the Outstanding Performer of the Year Award in a Tribute celebration at the Arlington on Feb. 6.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8361stZ8n0w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/sb-international-film-festival-promises-big-celebrities-and-films/","id":6034,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6033,6032,6031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stealing: It Does More Damage Than You Think (And Not Just to Your Conscience) w","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James.

Throughout history there have been countless figures that decided they were going to get rich quick by unlawful means. At some point we have all fantasized about planning a heist with the “Ocean’s Eleven” team or being a part of a high speed chase with the guys from the movie “Heat.” Despite the grandiose nature of some of the figures in history, thefts happen much more frequently and are nowhere near as glamorous.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I was caught trying to steal a pair of headphones from the UCSB bookstore — an inexpensive pair of headphones that were 100 percent insignificant in the scope of things, but turned out to be very significant for me. The worst part was that I had money on me that I could have used to pay for them! After a lifetime of becoming “educated,” I went and broke a cardinal rule that we supposedly learned as toddlers. Apparently I missed that day of preschool.</p>\n<p>The following weeks were laden with sleepless nights and questions about what was going to happen to me. Was I going to get kicked out of UCSB? Was I going to have to go to court? What were the side effects of my stupidity going to be? After weeks of tossing and turning over my uncertain future, I finally got my answer. My savior came in the form of a meeting that admitted me into the Restorative Justice program on campus. The program essentially serves as an alternative, more constructive penance that helps you fix whatever wrongdoings you may have committed. This was a much better solution than the medieval punishment for stealing of chopping off a hand (which I was expecting).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During the RJ circle, I shared my story with a group of people who were affected by my actions. After hearing how I affected the people in the circle, the group and I came up with some things I could do to make up for my wrongdoing and give back to my community. As part of the sanctions, I was able to talk to both the asset protection manager at UCSB’s Bookstore as well as the local District Attorney’s office, the people I would have faced if not for qualifying for the RJ program.</p>\n<p>I was utterly shocked to learn that the bookstore loses over $50,000 a year from shoplifting. On top of that, I discovered that all of the money from the bookstore goes back to UCSB students in one way or another, so I was basically stealing from myself, my friends and the rest of my colleagues at UCSB. I went on to find out that I could have been facing thousands of dollars in fines, legal fees, possible jail time and the lifelong brand as a criminal. All of this for a simple little pair of headphones!</p>\n<p>Some people think that stealing something of such a minute nature can’t have that much effect on their life or the people they stole from. I thought that way for a while, and let me be the first to tell you that my life will forever be changed by the side effects of my seemingly trivial unlawful acquisition of merchandise.</p>\n<p>My parents always told me to learn lessons the easy way by not making the mistakes yourself. I learned this one the hard way, and I hope that everyone will take my mistake and learn from where I went wrong. The moral of the story? Don’t steal from the Bookstore or anywhere else for that matter. It is just not worth all of the side effects.</p>\n<p>Zach Healy is a fourth-year communication major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46739\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46739\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-08/stealing-damage-conscience/","id":6035,"author":{"id":521,"name":"Zach Healy"},"related":[6034,6033,6032],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Emotions Spring Up During Michael Keaton’s Tribute","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFF-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Michael Keaton is well-loved.

A man who has done genres from salacious comedy to psycho-thriller, he’s scored admiration from co-stars and directors alike in his career, which began in 1968 when he operated “Picture, Picture” for Mister Rogers. But the fact that Keaton is well-loved was perhaps never as overwhelmingly apparent as it was last Saturday, Jan. 31 during his Maltin Modern Master tribute ceremony for his work in “Birdman.” Between Jeff Bridges’ video message, Danny Devito’s surprise entrance and SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling’s tearful speech, the love was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It started off with a speech from ­­­film critic Leonard Maltin, who moderated the evening. Instead of the proverbial praising of Keaton for all that he has done, Maltin opted for a flashback. “I remember sitting in the theater in Manhattan on Broadway with my wife in 1982 … and watching a movie called ‘Night Shift,’” he said. “Onto the screen burst this extraordinary comedic performer.”</p>\n<p>Maltin continued by focusing not on the Birdman-Batman dichotomy that so many film critics have fallen for, but instead insisting that “Birdman is just a reaffirmation of Michael Keaton’s enormous talent.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Birdman as a reaffirmation of his talent” was a theme that continued throughout the night, a direct response to all the press Keaton is getting for his absence in Hollywood. “Birdman” stars Keaton as a washed-up actor famous for being a superhero, who attempts to restore his craft through theater. So it’s pretty easy to compare Keaton’s own life to that of his character — actor famous for being a superhero disappears until this movie. Perhaps Keaton’s personal life was part of director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s impetus for placing him as Riggan Thomson.</p>\n<p>More likely though is that Keaton’s reputation as a versatile actor contributed to him getting this role, one that has landed him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as a contender for the Oscar. Whatever the reason, the fact that Keaton is a man of many roles was spelled out time and time again during his tribute at the Arlington.</p>\n<p>“Hi Michael, it’s your old friend Noni … I think this [award is] kind of great because it is for your body of work,” said Winona Ryder, in her video message that kicked off “Beetlejuice” clips. She stood in the snow at Sundance, clearly freezing in a hooded coat as she voiced her excitement for Keaton. “The thing about you is that I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people cannot decide what their favorite Michael Keaton movie is … because you create such extraordinary characters.”</p>\n<p>Judging from his expressiveness when talking about his career, it seemed like one of Keaton’s favorites to work on was definitely “Beetlejuice.” The actor lit up while talking about Tim Burton. “Tim. He’s unique,” he said, as the crowd laughed. “It’s not a word you can apply to many people … He had this thing, but he couldn’t quite [describe it yet]. He wasn’t there yet.” Keaton mentioned that he almost didn’t do the movie because the visionary eccentric Burton wasn’t describing anything he could understand.</p>\n<p>But a great thing about working with Burton [apart from directors like, say, Tarantino] was that he did not monopolize his directing status, and allowed Keaton to be part of the creative process. “[Tim told me that] maybe [Betelgeuse] lives under rocks — so I got the idea of mold. That’s where the mold came from.”</p>\n<p>In 1989, Keaton got to work with Burton again for “Batman” and he developed the rough voice that the superhero became so iconic for. He was, in fact, the very first Batman that gave Bruce Wayne a different voice in the suit.</p>\n<p>“I’d move from Bruce Wayne to Batman, [and thought] he had to transcend. I worked out this whole bullshit actor-y thing. I thought, ‘I gotta have something that makes me believe I don’t walk out on the street in this big rubbery suit and people think — hey Bruce Wayne is out again.’ So I did the voice. And we just used it. Every time I was Batman I altered my voice.”</p>\n<p>That bullshit actor-y thing became the basis for Keaton’s Birdman voice. “[For “Birdman”], the voice got crazier, with more incarnations of it. And then it grew from that.”</p>\n<p>The voice is just one of the aesthetic elements of “Birdman,” a drums-steered movie where the camera never stops rolling. “It was a risky gig, for all of us. But what are we here for? We are here for a millisecond,” said Keaton. “For me courage is the ultimate. That’s it. You gotta have guts.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton’s guts were displayed well and true in “Birdman,” but the thing that made this particular evening so special was the enormous affection showered onto him by colleagues. And no video message, not even Robert Duval or Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s, could top the emotion of SBIFF Artistic Director Roger Durling.</p>\n<p>“In 2001, Michael would show up to a coffee shop in Summerland and order a double nonfat latte from a barista,” he began. “[He’d] show up on Sundays to my little café to talk to me about movies … On the red carpet when you just drove in on your limo, you turned to people and said ‘Where is mi amigo Roger’ and it just so shows who you are,” Durling’s voice started cracking.</p>\n<p>“[You’re] not just one of the greatest actors working today, but you’re full of integrity. You are such a real man, an hombre. I feel crystallized that the 12 years I’ve been working at the film festival, it was all meant for me to be able to honor you tonight. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton is well-loved. Yes, indeed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/","id":6036,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6035,6034,6033],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
