One of them was the 2006 NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year—a.k.a., UCSB’s very own head coach, Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s familiarity with Cal Poly dates back to 1985 when he began playing collegiate soccer for UCSB. Now into his 20th year at the helm of the soccer program, the seasoned coach is able to look back at 30+ years of match-ups and observe the evolution of the rivalrous nature between the programs.</p>\n<p>“We’ve always had kind of a natural rivalry against them because of the location and distance. Even back when I played, it was always a game that we used to always want to play,” Vom Steeg reflects.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s program, however, never quite matched the level of Santa Barbara’s. Before officially meeting UCSB in Big West Conference play in 1996, it made its way through Division II and did not enter Division I until 1994.</p>\n<p>Preoccupied with their in-conference battle with Cal State Northridge for top-seed, the Gauchos paid little attention to the Mustangs’ entering. Vom Steeg recalls, “When they joined Big West…we didn’t think much about Cal Poly.” He acknowledges that Santa Barbara’s “general success” over them fed into the maturing feud.</p>\n<p>Upon the series of events in 2007 as aforementioned, however, the rivalry escalated to a level beyond prediction.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has materialized into packed stadiums and rowdy crowds, distasteful screaming of ironic slogans like “Cuck Fal Poly”, and an ungodly amount of tortillas thrown-to-waste.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg carefully makes an important distinction between how the UCSB-Cal Poly rivalry takes form at Alex. G. Spanos Stadium versus that at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“The fans up at Cal Poly…are there mainly to…have a big party. They turn it…a little bit more into just an event that you get a bunch of people together and scream and yell,” he states matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>For a number of reasons, traveling to Cal Poly is hardly an enjoyable experience for the team. The close quartered football-turned-soccer field subjects them to audible criticisms from thousands of hovering fans.</p>\n<p>Up in SLO, Vom Steeg continues, “The referees are usually more emotional. The last two years we’ve had water bottles thrown at us. If you happen to lose the game, [the fans] jump over the side…It’s really hard to play naturally [and]…easy to make it hard to play soccer.”</p>\n<p>Silencing the infamous crowd remains one of his most memorable moments at Spanos Stadium. In 2009, senior Chris Pontius scored seconds into double overtime to win the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The whole place was just absolutely quiet. Chris ran around the whole stadium, we were chasing him as he was celebrating, and the whole place was dead quiet,” he gladly recounted.</p>\n<p>In the coach’s eyes, Harder Stadium harbors a much more authentic environment for the team. The professional-like layout opens up the field while separating the players from the overwhelming crowds.</p>\n<p>He mostly appreciates the fans’—comprised of both students and locals—knowledge of the actual game, noting, “It feels like a soccer game. The cheering is about good plays on the field,” as compared to screaming about the opponent’s mistakes.</p>\n<p>This aspect, among others, was one of the driving factors in Vom Steeg’s decision in 1999 to take control of a struggling program that had, in the season prior to his arrival, merely two wins and 17 losses to its name.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Vom Steeg’s first time coaching UCSB was against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>20 years later, the accomplished coach has deep-rooted ties to Santa Barbara and holds some of the biggest accolades in collegiate soccer.</p>\n<p>He is a two-time NCSAA National Coach of the Year and a five-time Big West Coach of the Year. Under the reigns of Vom Steeg, UCSB made it into the Sweet 16 of NCAA four times and even hosted and won an NCAA Championship along the way.</p>\n<p>Talking about the essential creation of and dedication to the soccer program, Vom Steeg notes,</p>\n<p>“The big key for me has been the amount of work, the energy we’ve put in, the relationships we developed. The idea of starting over again has kept me from looking [at other options]. I’d rather keep enjoying what we’ve built here, and I still think there’s room for us to get better.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, this hard work has contributed to the establishment of Santa Barbara’s winning record over Cal Poly; one that, as of recently however, has begun to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Now awaiting the 41st matchup, Vom Steeg hopes to break the sense of complacency that has overwhelmed the Gauchos’ gameplay in the past years. Upon the hiring of former US National coach Steve Sampson, Cal Poly has strategically and effectively dulled the matchups against their blue and gold rival. The result? Four straight draws at Harder Stadium since 2014, the latest two finalizing with scores of 0-0.</p>\n<p>To rationalize SLO’s gameplay, Vom Steeg points out, “When you get caught in a situation where maybe you’re not sure your talent matches up, you do things on the field to make it really hard to play.”</p>\n<p>He continues, “It’s up to us this year to, more than ever, try to figure out how we can make it into a more exciting soccer game than what it’s been.”</p>\n<p>Coach Tim Vom Steeg hopes to disrupt this pattern of stagnancy with a sweet victory over the Mustangs. After all, the win could be the 258th of his career, 24th against their program, and the key to unleashing the prideful insanity that the community has so eagerly awaited to display.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/","id":3664,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[3663,3662,3661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson","biography":"Not available","articles":[15,17,18,19,20,21,27,29,30,1242,1245,1246,1248,1249,1255,1256,1258,1260,1262,1266,1268,1269,1282,1286,1343,1356,1362,1375,1376,3664,5681,6869],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Term in Review: EVPLA Christian Ornelas","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2020-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/christiano_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/christiano_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Besides his original platform goals, Ornelas’ position as EVPLA required his participation in frequent student and administration discussions across campus. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has compiled profiles of our current Associated Students (A.S.) elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

And I don’t care if someone gets mad at me or I’m just going to bring up these issues that I’m passionate about or that my constituents are telling me to,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas began his career in campus politics as a senator in the 2018-2019 school year. Now, he’s finishing out his term as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and preparing to pass on the baton to his successor, third-year political science major Yasamin Salari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over his year-long term, Ornelas said he learned to adopt a more restrained attitude and balanced approach to serving the study body. He said some of the best advice he received during his term was from Katya Armistead, UC Santa Barbara’s dean of student life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She told me ‘You’re going to have to learn how to choose your battles and if it’s something that you really want to go into, then give it your all and don’t look back,’” Ornelas said. “That’s not anything I was thinking about last year. Like last year I was just like, I’m going to call out anyone and see what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides his original platform goals — which included creating a monthly farmer’s market in Isla Vista, hosting special-topic classes co-taught by professors and students and solving mold issues in housing — Ornelas’ position as EVPLA required his participation in frequent student and administration discussions across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these discussions included higher-ups from the UC Police Department (UCPD) or UCSB administration, like Chancellor Henry T. Yang, and gave him a look into important conversations happening around campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was privileged to just [have] these really unique situations that students would never be able to be in the room for. I was the student that was allowed into the room. So acknowledging that privilege but also struggling sometimes with kind of feelings of imposter syndrome and stuff like that was really interesting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he dealt with self-doubt in some of these discussions and teetered between feeling the need to speak out and not knowing when to step in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had moments where I was like, ‘Okay, you need to be in this room, you need to say something,’ but also struggling with like, ‘Okay, why am I in this room? Am I qualified to be in this room?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said the pressure to please everyone was much greater in an executive position than as a senator. Over the past year, he said the balance between mollifying the university, serving his constituency and accomplishing his platform points proved difficult. In the end, he was not able to accomplish all of his platform points, including the co-taught classes, but he pointed to a few moments in his term that exemplified his commitment to serving students’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those includes the district supervisor </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/3rd-district-supervisor-candidates-field-community-questions-at-isla-vista-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall in February, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organized by Ornelas’ office, that featured two of three candidates running to be the Third District Supervisor for Santa Barbara County, a seat currently held by Joan Hartmann. Ornelas said the event was important for I.V. residents to hear from the candidates, since “the supervisors literally determine so much for us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he acknowledged the drama regarding the absence of one candidate, Bruce Porter, at the meeting. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter initially planned to attend the meeting, but after some confusion surrounding the date of the town hall, Porter said he would not be attending and asked Ornelas’ office to reschedule the event. Ornelas responded to Porter saying that while his office would not be rescheduling the event, it was “very open to hosting another town hall event.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was kind of one of those moments like, ‘Okay, we need to remain nonpartisan and just like not politicize this.’ And so our response was pretty much like, ‘We’re sorry [that] you can’t be here,’” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornerlas also had success in organizing open markets in I.V. that brought music, vendors and services to Little Acorn Park once a quarter. He originally planned to bring downtown Santa Barbara’s farmers markets to I.V. to provide the same access to fresh produce, but decided that the potential collaboration would place too many restrictions on I.V.’s open market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPLA office instead sponsored the I.V. Open Markets, which had been operating independently since before he took office. The office’s sponsorship relieved the financial burden for vendors who participated in the market by covering deposits and paying for the park rental. His office also helped to organize the logistical elements, like waste and water services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said he was especially proud of the expansion of the market over his term, which included bringing multiple bands — such as Art Official and Careless Club — and increasing the number of participating vendors and attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a lot of planning that went into that and we had like thousands of people and like the most vendors we’d ever had and everyone liked the music,” Ornelas said. “That was kind of just a passion project that was really rewarding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One project he said has been his most impactful — and one that Ornelas hopes Salari will continue to develop — are the relationships he said he has fostered between the UCPD and the EVPLA office, which took shape in the development of the police collaborative board and other working groups. Ornelas’ predecessor, Jeike Meijer, helped to </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-17/police-collaborative-board-breaks-ground-with-first-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch the program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toward the end of her term in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Ornelas planned to use the board to address community members’ concerns about the allegations </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made in several lawsuits against UCPD,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the task proved more tedious and complicated than planned. Ornelas said his office had planned a community forum to facilitate discussion about the lawsuits, but after the coronavirus pandemic cancelled in-person classes at UCSB, the possibility for a forum thinned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Ornelas said his relationships, in particular with Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder and UCPD officer Ariel Bournes, produced benefits for the community in other ways, like discussions about safety for major events like Halloween and Deltopia, the promotion of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the party registration program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the UCPD instagram account created by Bournes, who contacted Ornelas for advice about creating the profile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the coronavirus pandemic threw a wrench in many plans for this spring quarter, Ornelas said that as students’ needs shifted under the new circumstances, his office was able to meet those needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his successor, Salari, Ornelas said he hopes that she will be able to carry on the work that his office has put in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did a lot of the groundwork for the next EVPLA and a lot of it was already here for me too, so I’m hopeful that when Yasamin comes in, she can see the work that we had done and kind of start her term up with that,” Ornelas said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the next EVPLA’s term still involves some uncertainty as to how the duties will be carried out during a world pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re looking at the possibility of a remote fall [quarter], what does that look like for the next EVPLA?” he asked. “I’m not exactly sure.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Her vending machine specifically for food insecure students  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a project two years in the making </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be placed in Associated Students (A.S.) Main sometime in the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also continued the work of her predecessor Brooke Kopel in finding a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop. By the end of her term, Sir narrowed down a final location for the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s Strategic Vision Task Force met weekly to reassess the Strategic Vision 2020, a project first started by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud. The project aimed to revamp the way A.S. addresses the larger student body through increased accessibility, outreach and transparency, she said. Throughout her term, Sir helped to create Strategic Vision 2025, a follow up to Abboud’s plan; finalizing this plan will continue with the next A.S. president, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond the tangible projects, Sir said she was most proud of how she advocated for students’ needs with the UC Santa Barbara administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to her role in creating UCSB’s first Mental Health Taskforce, which held its first town hall </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in early February</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but saw a low turnout of students; her work at the end of winter quarter, when she helped students whose professors refused to cancel in-person finals; and her work at the end of fall, when she said she </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brought students’ concerns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the sexual assault allegations against members of Sigma Pi to the administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she was able to be a resource for students during Fall Quarter 2019, when UCSB fraternities faced several allegations of sexual assault either by members of the fraternity or on fraternity property. Many student leaders and groups criticized administrators for not being transparent about the allegations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she spoke to several members of the administration about students’ concerns; the administration, in response, created a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/task-force-for-safer-social-events-in-i-v-meets-for-second-time-to-hear-updates-about-new-ifc-regulations-university-communications/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safer Social Events in Isla Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> task force to improve safety at social events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a member of Greek life herself, emphasized that the task force still has a great deal of work to do in terms of making Isla Vista safer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when the end of Winter Quarter 2020 hit, Sir said she and her fellow executives compiled testimonials from students’ whose professors had refused to cancel in-person finals, despite the university asking instructors to make alternate arrangements, back when the university initially planned for </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students to return at the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she and the executives then brought those testimonials to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who allowed them to witness calls he then placed to each professor, “trying to persuade [professors], ‘Hey, this is what students are feeling. This is a testimonial from your class.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she spe</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nt her spring break “constantly calling the Chancellor, the administration and Marisela [Márquez]” to find out what was next for UCSB’s students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following all these conversations, Sir said s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he used an A.S. executive order to launch the A.S. COVID-19 Response Task Force to help centralize all communications and project proposals related to the coronavirus. The task force, chaired by Senate First Pro Tempore Tianna White and Sir’s Chief of Staff Adam Chohan, held its first weekly meeting on May 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force was able to grant Student Health money for face masks and help students figure out where to request additional grants from A.S. She added that herself and her fellow executives sent out a survey that was later used to create a list of resources specific to different student groups on campus, such as transfer students and undocumented students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“40% of the job is showing up and being present with what students need in front of the administration,” she said. “I feel like I’ve definitely done that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s successor, A.S. President-elect Daevionne Beasley, was sworn in Wednesday night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/ucsb-student-says-a-s-president-elect-sexually-assaulted-him-in-2018/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent allegation of sexual assault</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Beasley, Sir declined to comment, and said the allegation “[is] not part of my term in review.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday, Sir released a statement on her social media accounts and the official Office of the President accounts saying she would be putting her social media accounts “on lockdown </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">due to the extreme harassment I faced on social media for the past week,” an apparent reference to calls for her to address the allegation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to support and serve people after my term, but I will not respond to cyberbullying and intimidation tactics. While I have always been happy to speak with students throughout my term, the way in which I’ve been contacted and the words people have chosen to approach me with are extremely inappropriate,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izzy Mitchell, a second-year communication and economics double major who created a petition to recall Beasley from office, said she has reached out to Sir both on social media and through messages to Sir herself, according to Mitchell’s social media account, Gauchos4Transparency.

As UC Santa Barbara’s representative for the student body at the statewide and national level, he said his overall goal was to make sure “that students are [aware of] these issues that affect them at those levels.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the year, Beasley said he picked up other projects, such as the fight against the construction of the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (TMT) in Hawaii. Through </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus events</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Beasley said he and his office worked to inform students of Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement with the telescope project, and in turn, make Yang aware of students’ discontent with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his work surrounding TMT was not part of his original platform, Beasley said spreading awareness about the project was one of his proudest accomplishments of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Life comes at you fast and at any moment you could have all of that thrown up in the air,” Beasley said. “And I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to put this platform point to the side and focus on what students are actually suffering through right now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his work with TMT, Beasley said the biggest lesson he learned came from amplifying student voices through proper representation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you want to advocate for people that aren’t in the room, you need to bring them into the room. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t have them there with you,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also saw the creation of its first organizing department, which serves to support other student organizations on campus by providing funding and assistance, Beasley said. Creating a new arm for the executive office required the office to rewrite portions of A.S. Legal Code, but Beasley said he believed the change helped to strengthen the office as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also had the opportunity to tap into the United States Student Association (USSA) budget, which Beasley said allowed him to allocate $30,000 to UCSB Lobby Corps to cover the group’s lobbying trips and increase the number of Washington D.C. and Sacramento trips the group could take. Because USSA has not hosted any events since 2018, Beasley said the lock-in fee language surrounding the organization permits him to access its budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the extra funding, Beasley said the EVPSA office also collaborated with UCSB’s Human Rights Board to host a Criminal Justice Lobby Day, in which group members flew to D.C. to “talk to legislators about legalizing marijuana at the federal level,” along with other criminal justice reforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his office also saw success in other areas as well. This year’s EVPSA office was the first to fully fund the UCSB Black Student Union’s annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference and also hosted 22 A.S. fellows — the most of any of the five executive offices, Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Beasley noted that he did have some difficulty with the Students of Color Conference in fall quarter. The event is organized by the UC Student Association (UCSA), and each UC’s Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) typically sends a delegation of students. Beasley said there were issues coordinating between UCSA and UCSB S.C.O.R.E., calling it “one of the top three toughest moments” of this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley added that the coronavirus pandemic upended his plans for spring quarter. He said he had planned on hosting UCSB’s Gender Bias Summit with Students Against Sexual Assault President and EVPSA-elect Alia Reynolds, as well as attending the annual Student Lobby Conference (SLC), which he said is one of the EVPSA office’s largest events of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of concern for student safety amid the coronavirus pandemic, Beasley said SLC was canceled following a vote from UCSA’s Executive Vice President representatives from each UC, including Beasley. The cancellation of SLC resulted in about $80,000 of unanswered refund requests for hotel reservations, which Beasley said wiped out UCSA’s “entire rainy day fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from canceled events, the timing of the coronavirus pandemic — which threw </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">winter quarter finals week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into a frenzy — left many students on edge about the nature of finals week. During this time, Beasley said he worked with A.S. President Alison Sir to create a Google form to field questions and concerns from students about the status of their exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After accumulating over 250 responses, Beasley said he and Sir arranged a meeting with Yang, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and the chair of the Academic Senate, Henning Bohn, to review the student concerns and explore alternatives to in-person finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got to the meeting and it was very high tension. Chancellor Yang was obviously under a lot of stress and pressure. He said he had faculty hitting him from all sides, saying that ‘you can’t force us to do an online course or do ProctorU or do this or do that,’” Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But he was also trying to level with us as students to do what was best for us,” he said, adding that he and Sir stressed to Yang that students are key stakeholders in the success of the university and that “faculty only exist on the campus because of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After relaying student testimonies and continuing discussions with the Academic Senate and UCSB administration, Beasley said the university decided to allow professors a choice: either move all finals online or cancel them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his year as a whole, Beasley said the one thing he would change about his office is its accessibility to students. “Of course when you hear ‘A.S. President,’ you’re like, ‘Okay, they’re the ones who are supposed to advocate for me,’” but far too often, he said, students forget that other executive offices may be a better fit for their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds will be sworn in as the new EVPSA during tonight’s Senate meeting. Beasley said he hopes that Reynolds will expand the EVPSA office and use it to “continue connecting with the marginalized groups on campus, to learn about cultural issues outside of her comfort zone and to keep an open mind to new challenges and experiences.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
