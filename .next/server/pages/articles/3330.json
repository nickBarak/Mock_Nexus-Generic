Besides having also won five pennants, this team took it all the way to the top in 2015 only to lose the World Series to the reigning American League champions, the Kansas City Royals. It seems evident that this New York team is fired up and ready to claim the title as their own this year.</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>, </em>Madison Bumgarner is likely to pitch for the Giants against the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard. Affectionately known as “Madbum” and “Thor,” these two power players have both played solid seasons with their teams going 15-9 and 14-9 while on the mound, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bumgarner, a 27-year-old from North Carolina, made his MLB debut in 2009 and has impressed the baseball world ever since. Although he was part of three World Series champion teams and has won numerous individual accolades, 2014 remains his best year to date.</p>\n<p>He was the winner of the Babe Ruth Award, named NLCS MVP, as well as World Series MVP in addition to his exceptional performance in postseason. Out of high school, he was selected tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants and has only continued to improve his abilities as a player and a teammate.</p>\n<p>Syndergaard, only having made his debut in May of 2015, has been a firecracker on the field and an enormous asset to his team. Drafted 38th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, this Texan quickly worked his way to the top leaving a notable trail behind him.</p>\n<p>In 2013, he started for Team USA in the Futures Game and by the end of the year was ranked the 11th-best prospect in baseball by<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>.</em> He performed with outstanding ability in the 2015 World Series as a rookie and became the second- youngest Met to win a World Series game. Although he is newer to the big leagues, Syndergaard has certainly proven his worth, not to mention his knack for strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The winner of this game will advance to the divisional round of the National League playoffs on Friday where they will meet the top seeded Chicago Cubs. During the 2016 season, both Wild Card candidates have been evenly matched with the National League Central team.</p>\n<p>In May, the Giants defeated the Cubs two games to one, yet in September San Francisco lost at home in a four-game series, losing the set 3-1.</p>\n<p>Alternately, in early July the Mets swept the Cubs when playing on their own turf, but lost the three game set at Wrigley Field, 2-1.</p>\n<p>This year’s potential World Series candidates are at their strongest and working their hardest. While a majority of the 2016 Major League Baseball Season has been exciting, nothing compares to the intensity of postseason play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/","id":3330,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[3329,3328,3327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander","biography":"Not available","articles":[248,281,283,301,304,307,310,467,470,472,493,514,1919,3330],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"In Photos | AFSCME Strikes for Sixth Time in Two Years","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AFSCME_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"AFSCME 3299 represents more than 24,000 health care and service employees across the UC system.

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall gave planning services company KTUA  — which provides analysis and improves landscapes and transportation systems — an opportunity to share its concepts for redesigned UCSB transport, which will be implemented in the coming years to accommodate several new campus buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite a call for student voices to be involved in the new design, only six UCSB students attended the town hall when “we would have liked two hundred,” Tom Bertulis, a senior transportation engineer with KTUA, lamented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member spoke out about the lack of student voices at the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You think that students have the time to come to a two-hour meeting? Students are very busy, and that’s why they can’t come. If you need them to answer these questions, maybe email them,” he half-jokingly told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertulis began his presentation, he touched upon UCSB’s recent platinum-level bike friendliness designation, noting that UCSB is one of eight colleges in the nation to receive it and emphasizing the campus’s “unique bike culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, there are almost 1,300 bike trips in a peak 15-minute period. I’ve never seen anything like this… there are definitely unique challenges this campus faces in regards to bikes. Even a freeway can’t handle that many cars in such a short period,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alissa Hummer, director of Campus Planning and Design, explained the campus expansion that the renovated transit plans are meant to address, which include the construction of a new lecture hall that will begin within the next one and a half years, with 540 new faculty residences and a new student housing project in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we need to not have people bike on the interior of campus and just put bike racks on the outside?” Hummer asked. “It’s something to consider. At this point, everything is on the table.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new lecture hall, which is being built to accommodate increased class sizes, will most likely divert bike traffic onto UCen Road, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students understand the constraints of building a new lecture hall, but they understandably have some trepidation. We haven’t yet tried to mix bikes and cars in the same transport lane, but it will only be for about a block,” Hummer said. “In addition, we will most likely need new bike paths coming into the western side of campus to accommodate the new housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence of campus biking is why second-year environmental science major Sophie Roberts, a member of the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, decided to attend the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to maintain the bike paths that we have, and even add new ones because there’s so much bike traffic here already that closing paths could be dangerous,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, I have a class in the Psych Building, and then 10 minutes later I have a class on the other side of campus, and it’s physically impossible for me to get there by walking, which is why it’s so important to me we keep the bike paths.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Samarin, a KTUA consultant, emphasized wanting to clear up misconceptions students might have about the remodelling and removal of various bike paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The university has proposed some things, which are at this point just proposals. We’re here today to listen to feedback and see how people feel,” Samarin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In regards to closing bike paths, that would be for paths that are underused. We might be able to repurpose those for shuttles. It’s not removing paths just to remove them, it would be to accommodate other mobility,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertulis also brought up the idea of autonomous campus shuttles known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles, which are futuristic-looking white shuttles that could hypothetically transport students to opposite ends of campus and provide an alternative mode of transport for students who have trouble walking across campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was speaking to someone who represents the disabled population on campus and currently we have Uber and Lyft reimbursement for students who need a shuttle type of service. But we’re looking at more regular type of shuttle that could come more regularly and serve a larger demographic, if there’s demand,” Samarin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making campus transportation more accessible for disabled individuals was a key point throughout the moderated conversation at the town hall. Currently, making sure handicapped individuals have the transport services they need is one of KTUA’s “number one priorities,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the town hall, Hummer ended her conversation with a question for students and staff alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really have to look at this bike system that was never formally designed but was put together piece by piece by piece. We need to look at how it’s circulating. Are the bones of this system good and just need some tweaking, or is it fundamentally broken and we need to retool it all together?”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

among the UC system, most of the centers are between 20 and 30 years old,” current RCSGD director Craig Leets, who is the center’s ninth director, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were many students, staff and volunteers and other students who all have made the center of what it is today, who have brought the center through 20 years,” Leets added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s always important to me, to honor and recognize like the people who came before us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center kicked off its 20th anniversary celebrations with an event on Tuesday evening, with Leets giving attendees a small history of the RCSGD. He started by describing how the center, then known as the Queer Resource Center, was first started by a group of student activists in 1999 after the death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The students] organized to convince Chancellor Yang, who was here then and is still here now, that we needed a specific resource center for LGBTQ students. At the time that MCC existed, as well as the Women’s Center. But there was no university-funded space for LGBTQ students,” Leets explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff members then began a video call with former students, staff and activists who had worked with the center in the past, all of whom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflected on the activism involved with the RCSGD to celebrate it.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabrina Kwist, dean of equity and inclusion at Los Medanos College, who was a key part of the activism behind the founding of the RCSGD, was on the call and spoke to attendees about the experience of creating the center.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kyle Richards, the director of the RCSGD from 2002 to 2007, the center was originally located on the third floor of the University Center (UCen), next to University and Community Housing Services — Leets said that this was why the kickoff was held in the UCen as opposed to the center’s current location on the third floor of the Student Resource Building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The center was on] the third floor next to the community housing office and it was a small lounge and an office with a desk and a little library and then some sofas and that was about it,” Richards said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was during my time here that we moved over … That was when the Student Resource Building was first built and we were one of the first tenants that moved into it when it was opened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also during Richards’ time as director that the center changed its name from the Queer Resource Center to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, citing concerns that “queer” was inapplicable to people who did not identify as such.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a concern that the word ‘queer’ may be off-putting to some people, or they may be scared or didn’t identify as queer. So we wanted a name that was more inclusive to people, that felt like a broader terminology that was more representative of the greater community,” Richards explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He joked that despite the center’s name change, “RCSGD” wasn’t quite the nice, quick acronym they had hoped for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Richards, during the center’s early days it only had a very small budget to work with, so the center would partner with other campus organizations such as the MultiCultural Center and the Women’s Center to bring in speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it was a queer-related theme, then we would co-sponsor it with them and add it to a programming calendar of events that we would distribute. We would cross list things; that’s how we kind of maximized what we did, by partnering with other campus offices. That was the main way,” Richards said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the kickoff isn’t all the center has planned for the 20th anniversary. During Winter Quarter, the center will have 20th anniversary keynote speakers — to be announced in the coming weeks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— for its trans revolution series, Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also added that the center plans to invite alumni back to its annual drag brunch and will finish up the year by inviting alumni and past center staff for a dinner that will “recognize the history of the center.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the kickoff event, Leets announced the launch of a photo installation project for the outside of the director’s office at the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you post [photos] on social media and use any one of these four hashtags, we will use those at the end of the year to create a permanent photo installation that will live on in the center, similar to the mural that was created for the 15th anniversary,” Leets said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets added that he hopes to expand on the services offered by the center — referencing the recent initiative by the center to implement pronouns across several university systems — and to continue making the campus a more inclusive place for LGBTQ+ people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a vibrant community within our lounge here in the Student Resource Building — [we’re] trying continually to make UCSB be a welcoming place for all LGBTQ+ people.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
