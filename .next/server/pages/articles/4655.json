The main message in the video ad centers on the letters “I.V.” and encourages viewers to keep I.V. safe by giving back to the community and living a life that makes you proud. The ad will be broadcasted on television in Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, Oxnard and San Luis Obispo County and also shared through social media.</p>\n<p>UCSB, SBCC and the city of Goleta each contributed $15,000 for the campaign and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department each donated $5,000. I.V. Safe is comprised of government stakeholders and receives $10,000 annually in funding from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney and chair of I.V. Safe Joyce Dudley said the committee’s top priority is to rebrand I.V. and change its reputation.</p>\n<p>“The group said the most important thing is to change the image of Isla Vista,” Dudley said. “To take it away from being the party school where you come here, you abuse alcohol, drugs and the environment and take advantage of people, commit crimes.”</p>\n<p>According to Dudley, the committee is working with film director, writer and branding consultant Ken Berris on the campaign. Dudley said Berris’ daughter attended UCSB and Berris has previously collaborated with the university to create ads during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“He’s working very closely with UCSB and they came up with those Halloween ads,” Dudley said. “Everybody felt for the rebranding it was going to be positive … and those beautiful pictures in the background that were donated, he brought that back to the committee and we all liked it.”</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he believes rebranding should be done from the “ground up” by Isla Vistans and not by officials in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m not trying to demean the work of my colleagues … but I believe they made a mistake by not consulting the community,” Abboud said. “This is a very sterile ad, made from people in downtown Santa Barbara who hired a professional consultant to create an ad. That’s why I personally feel like it won’t work, because it doesn’t have that genuine feeling of the town doing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, the ad targets locals in Santa Barbara, as well as students and their parents.<br>\n“The audience is going to be ideally everyone in Santa Barbara County, from students, to parents, to residents,” Berris said. “We want to start spreading this new communication about what we want I.V. to become again.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said the campaign is a “massive misstep” because it does not feature elected Isla Vistans.</p>\n<p>“They could use some prominent Isla Vistans in it and not elected officials and public officials from other cities,” Abboud said. “Maybe some of the younger looking people in the ad who look college-aged are Isla Vistans, but … we have a parks board of five people who live in Isla Vista. We have student elected leadership from A.S. None of them are in it.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said the campaign sets an expectation, and communicates to visitors certain behavior is not condoned in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If people see that’s what I.V. stands for, they’re not going to come here with the notion of destroying and thinking that the community itself is going to support the kinds of activities that have been going on there that negatively impacted public safety,” Dudley said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said few people will be exposed to the ad because many people are choosing mediums such as Netflix and Hulu over broadcasted television.</p>\n<p>“The majority of media consumed in Isla Vista is not through TV and cable TV in the traditional sense,” Abboud said. “A lot of people have transitioned to other sources like Netflix and Hulu, and this ad doesn’t seem like it would reach these people.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said he appreciates I.V. Safe creating the ad, but a brief campaign will not have a large impact on the long-time established I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“The image and quality of life in Isla Vista have been formed over the last 40 plus years (I lived there in the 70s),” Thurlow said in an email. “A media campaign on local television for one season will help but not have much impact. Having said that, we are appreciative of the District Attorney and Ken’s efforts.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, efforts to rebrand I.V. will take several years.</p>\n<p>“Where we’re looking at this is year one,” Berris said. “You don’t rebrand a community or implement new techniques in one year. We’re looking at this as a five to seven year campaign.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she will view the campaign as successful if it decreases the amount of crime and violence in I.V., and if not the committee may have to change its approach.</p>\n<p>“The way I’ll be interested in looking at it is did it reduce crime, did it reduce arrests, did it reduce injuries,” Dudley said. “If it’s during the time when these ads have had effect, then I think that’s terrific. If I’m not seeing a reduction in those kinds of things then I would think about other ways that we might want to redirect that fund.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he does not believe an ad will convince visitors not to come to I.V. or not to commit crimes during their stay.</p>\n<p>“If your ends are reducing crimes and reducing out of towners, this doesn’t seem like it meets those ends to me,” Abboud said. “I don’t know how an ad reduces crime, and I don’t know how an ad reduces out-of-towners. I think the people who come to Isla Vista to commit crimes are going to come regardless of an ad.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, I.V. Safe’s rebranding effort and exclusion of Isla Vistans in the conversation is not only ineffective but also disrespectful to those who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“No other community would ever have an external government body impose an ad campaign to rebrand it anywhere else in the state or the country, that doesn’t happen,” Abboud said. “It happens very rarely with disenfranchised or disempowered communities and not to respected ones. It shows to me they don’t respect us very much if they’re going to not include us in the conversation 100 percent.”<br>\nDudley said she sees the campaign as a way to show the current status quo of I.V. rather than altering the image of it.</p>\n<p>“I see it as not so much a rebranding, as really shining a spotlight on where Isla Vista is right now,” Dudley said. “For lack of a better word, all the things that happened there have had a very sobering effect on the community. The community has come together where public safety is a high priority for the people that live there.”</p>\n<p>Berris said he believes any community can be rebranded given time and effort.</p>\n<p>“The campaign is essentially the communication tool that lets everybody know that we are changing I.V. back to the great community it was once,” Berris said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/","id":4655,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4654,4653,4652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun","biography":"Not available","articles":[2342,2590,2757,2768,2776,2777,2834,2853,2878,3455,4655,4700,4749,4785],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"SB County Planning Commission Finds an Increase in I.V.

Students and long-term residents attended the meeting to give input during public comment, all of whom rebutted the survey results. The event ended with the Commission promising to hold another meeting addressing the issue of parking in I.V. to better incorporate the community and for staff to develop a new survey.</p>\n<p>Planning and Development staff member David Lackey said the survey found 34 new parking spots due to elimination of designated red curb areas, new measurements, car share programs and overall reduced total vehicles.</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination of factors that concluded that the overall parking spaces that were available were actually increasing as the capacity has remained the same,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Second District SB County Planning Commissioner Cecilia Brown said there has been an increase in student population at UCSB and in I.V. since 2004.</p>\n<p>“But from what I understand, there has been a decrease in vehicles in that community,” Brown said. “Is that a fair statement?”</p>\n<p>Lackey said in terms of a “general trend,” certain demographics such as younger populations are not bringing single personal vehicles in the community.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the many factors that were identified in the parking survey in 2013,” Lackey said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Associated Students (A.S.) representative Ethan Bertrand said overcrowding I.V. is unsafe and the community’s interests need to be taken into account when looking at I.V.’s future regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“There has been various outreach to the community, but I would say those have been ineffective and I would say we [the community] haven’t been provided with a chance to provide input and consideration to this,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Chair Pegeen Soutar said IVRPD requests the I.V. Master Plan process be postponed and sent back to the community for review. Soutar also asked that IVRPD to be the lead agency to gather input from the community on all matters related to recreation and parks.</p>\n<p>“Since the Master Plan was first created, we find it to be inconsistent with the active community plan for our parks,” Soutar said. “It is very hard to find parking in Isla Vista at all. As far as your study, we cannot find parking at all. I’m not sure where that 15 percent paring is at folks, but we’re not finding it.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, it is very difficult to find coastal access parking in I.V., especially when people come from out of town for recreational activities.</p>\n<p>“We have excellent surf spots out there,” Soutar said. “And trust me, there are hundreds of people that when the surf is going, they want to come into town and that is a huge problem.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Sue Dickson said she wants amendments for the Master Plan to be postponed because the plan no longer accurately reflects community needs and does not address the density, parking and development issues in the current drought.</p>\n<p>“The Master Plan itself is flawed and out of date,” Dickson said. “A lot of change has taken place in Isla Vista since it has been originally written. Much of the report is no longer relevant. I did not receive any outreach.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Susan Wickham said she was not notified regarding meetings about the I.V. Master Plan.</p>\n<p>“You need to bring the community back into the conversation and let us have an opportunity to acknowledge the changes and the whole plan as it goes through the process,” Wickham said. “I believe the survey needs to be redone.”</p>\n<p>Long-term resident Maia said I.V. residents are double parking, parking nose to tail with no space in between, parking on dirt lots and in other people’s lots and that land owners are charging for parking.</p>\n<p>“Now it is summer and students are gone mostly. I’ve seen the fewest parking spaces in any of the summers,” Maia said. “There’s no places for visitors to go. This is our personal experience and surveys don’t necessarily reflect that. Why would landlords be charging for parking when there’s lot of spaces?”</p>\n<p>I.V. Project Committee Chair Teddy Warfield said it is not beneficial for those who are not residents of I.V. to create plans for the community.</p>\n<p>“I have to mention the arrogant and high-handed services your county staff has provided for the Isla Vista Master Plan Project and this process,” Warfield said. “I never received any notice that this process was going on. Your staff has served us poorly in this process.”</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs Paola DeLa Cruz said the survey is incorrect; there is no parking in I.V. and apartment complexes charge up to $300 for parking spaces, a fee many students cannot afford.</p>\n<p>“The information that you have in front of you is inaccurate and definitely does not address safety in Isla Vista,” DeLa Cruz said.</p>\n<p>First District SB County Commissioner C. Michael Cooney said community expectations are not being met, particularly concerns of the student body and long-term residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“As an overall observation, I didn’t hear any support for our actions today,” Cooney said. “We have to emphasize to the Board of Supervisors that we need to look at the overall Master Plan through the eyes of the current Isla Vista, concerned Isla Vista population.”</p>\n<p>Third District SB County Commissioner Joan Hartmann said there needs to be more outreach in I.V. and increased community input to make a “reasonable” decision regarding parking.</p>\n<p>“I think we must ensure that people know what is happening and we need to do a better job.

There were no known witnesses to the crime and no arrests have been made.</p>\n<p>Congregation leaders at St. Michael’s University Church said in a statement they believe the vandalism to be connected to the church’s recent decision to display signs in favor of LGBTQ rights and “Black Lives Matter” signs.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed about this incident of vandalism on our church campus,” the statement reads. “[We] are especially concerned that it has occurred following the decision to display a rainbow flag and several ‘Black Lives Matter’ placards around the property.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, there is little for the department to say at this point in the investigation because of a lack of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>“[The officers] searched the area but were not able to locate anyone connected to the crime and no arrests have been made in the case,” Hoover said in an email. “There were no known witnesses in the crime.”</p>\n<p>Church leaders said they also believe the unknown criminal may be struggling emotionally.</p>\n<p>“We suspect the person who did this is hurting and angry,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Luke Bucklew said he believes the vandals were “not in their right mind” while causing the damage.</p>\n<p>“Maybe the people who did it were drunk or not in their right mind when they committed this act of hate and chaos,” Bucklew said. “I think it’s tragic that people in the city feel the need to vandalize property in whatever state of mind they’re in — inebriated or not.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/motives-for-recent-i-v-church-vandalism-under-investigation/","id":4653,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4652,4651,4650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Update: I.V.

Long-term residents, students and university and county officials voiced I.V. is at a critical turning point with many projects underway to improve safety and stability, and Plastino’s continued presence in I.V. would benefit the community.</p>\n<p>While the practice of the Sheriff’s department is to rotate IVFP leadership approximately every two years, individuals throughout I.V. believe Plastino’s role in projects such as training the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD) James McKarrell and preparing for the upcoming events of Halloween in the fall is important enough to lengthen the lieutenant’s term by a year or two.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he met with Sheriff Brown on Sept. 21, during which time the topic of an extension was discussed.</p>\n<p>“He expressed that he was not yet certain about how long I would remain in IV, although I think we all expect my assignment here to last at least through mid-April,” Plastino said in an email. “If I’m able to stay at least until April, I will be happy with that.  It was possible for me to move this past summer, so any additional time in IV is much appreciated.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said if he is replaced in April, he hopes he can provide input on a replacement for his position and spend time training the new lieutenant to ensure a smooth transition. Within IVFP, there is one patrol sergeant who could be promoted to lieutenant; otherwise Plastino’s replacement would come from a county-wide pool of current and future lieutenants, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“I do have a couple in mind that would do well here. I think personality and a desire to work with our very diverse population are very key criteria for any law enforcement manager in IV,” Plastino said in an email. “This also requires someone that is open to new ideas and is willing to break away from the standard models of policing.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is both humbled by the community’s request that he remain in I.V. and grateful they value his role in the community.<br>\n“They are all people and organizations that care about our town and spend so much of their time to make this place wonderful.   I am truly touched that they would want me to stay and help them,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/nexus-update-i-v-writes-to-keep-plastino/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/nexus-update-i-v-writes-to-keep-plastino/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/nexus-update-i-v-writes-to-keep-plastino/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/nexus-update-i-v-writes-to-keep-plastino/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-23/nexus-update-i-v-writes-to-keep-plastino/","id":4654,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[4653,4652,4651],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
