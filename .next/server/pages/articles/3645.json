The results night event was held this year over Zoom, a drastic shift from the traditionally high-energy, high-emotion atmosphere in the Hub in the University Center. Around 350 people tuned in tonight for the elections Zoom call, according to Davis Quan, A.S. Elections Board chair.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Campus United maintained its majority hold in the A.S. Senate for the fifth year in a row, claiming more than half of the seats, 14 out of this year’s 25.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The full list of senator-elects can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-23/live-a-s-spring-quarter-election-results-2020/\">here.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">President-elect Daevionne Beasley, who ran with Campus United, claimed his second executive position after first serving as the university’s External Vice President for Statewide Affairs during the 2019-20 school year. Beasley’s opponents in the presidential race, Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who ran with the Isla Vista Party, and Austin Foreman, who ran as an independent, trailed behind with 39.0% and 10.1% of the vote, respectively.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beasley said in an interview after the results night that he is excited about his win, but regretted that the circumstances of the digital spring quarter have forced the emotional and intimate tradition of election night to be held through screens and moderated remotely — cheering, hugs and tears have been replaced by digital reactions and instant messaging.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s like a really crazy feeling because [there is] a global pandemic, and I just won the presidential election, so I’m just feeling very bittersweet,” Beasley said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m very glad I got the win, but my fellow students aren’t able to feel the range of emotion they’d normally feel because now they’re off campus,” he added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In an interview, Segura-Esquivel assured that despite the loss, “I’m still gonna be around, I’m still gonna be doing as much work on this campus as possible, still advocating for my communities.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Foreman declined to comment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In another Campus United victory, Internal Vice President-elect Tianna White will preside over the A.S. Senate next year, winning over Isla Vista Party competitor Racquel Almario.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">White said she is proud of those who ran for seats this year and is looking forward to improving the workings of the Senate table in the school year to come.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“As someone who ran for Senate last year, it takes a lot, I know. I’m really excited for this year’s A.S. to institute real change for the students on this campus,” White said. “It’s our immense privilege to be as informed and engaged with the student body.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almario did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both External Vice President positions went to Isla Vista Party candidates, with Yasamin Salari taking the seat for External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and Alia Reynolds winning External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though the A.S. executive branch is split between the two parties, EVPLA-elect Salari — who won against Campus United’s Lea Toubian — said she is up for the challenge of working with people across party lines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Parties [are] something you run with, but I’m super excited to just set those aside once we get into office and just figure out how we can all help out each other and keep going,” Salari said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Salari said she doesn’t plan to waste time in preparing for next year’s work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m really excited to get the applications out for my office and hire people who are passionate about the job, who are involved, and just get the ball rolling. I don’t want to wait until summer. I’m really excited to just start building the office.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The race for EVPSA was the closest executive race of the night, with Reynolds winning by a 3.1% margin, or 159 votes. She said the online format of the elections results added anxiety to an already emotional night for candidates.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It was super stressful and the whole aspect of it being all digital made it harder for everyone’s mental health because digitizing everything can cause changes in self-perception,” Reynolds said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Reynolds and her opponent Beau Karnsrithong said the results had them on the edge of their seats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s like watching a literal race to the finish line as your bar slides down the screen,” said Karnsrithong, who held the lead in the first half of the results release.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Definitely nerve wracking, but exciting and gets your heart pumping.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The position of Student Advocate General –– an independent executive position that requires students to disaffiliate from campus parties –– went to Melissa Perez, who beat her opponent Tyler Ferguson with 53.5% of the vote.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I’m so honored and blessed to be serving as your next student advocate general!” Perez said in a text. “I’m honored to be helping to make AS more accessible to students of all backgrounds and I’m ready to make it a reality!”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ferguson declined to comment on election results. While he lost the executive position, Ferguson still took a win tonight with the passage of the constitutional amendment to create two new <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/a-s-senate-amendment-puts-two-international-student-senator-seats-onto-spring-ballot/\">international student senator seats,</a> which were placed on the ballot by a bill he wrote while serving as a senator. The addition of those two seats, bringing the Senate table up to 27 seats in total, will go into effect in the 2020-21 election cycle.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All reaffirmations on this year’s ballot passed. The sole new fee on the ballot, a fee for the Department of Public Worms, passed with 77.56% of the vote.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the second year in a row that voter turnout has dropped — 28.84% of undergraduate students voted this year, down 3.51% from last year. According to the A.S. Elections Board, 6,243 undergraduate students voted in this year’s election, as opposed to the 6,980 who voted in the 2018-19 election.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The board had concerns about meeting the 20% voter threshold for this year’s election, given the circumstances of the online spring quarter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results night suffered technical difficulties and started almost 30 minutes after the official start time as the A.S. Elections Board struggled to share the voting results through the Zoom call.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“We really couldn’t figure out what was going on,” Quan said. “We did do run-throughs a bit prior and it looked fine, but in the actual results it did look a bit worse.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the results on the screen lagged due to the technical issues, which Quan said took away from the momentum and overall experience of the night.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“You do kind of feel bad for the candidates that they sort of lost all the events that went along with the actual election in terms of campaigning and results night, as well as anything else that entails in the election season.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“But overall, I really think that this election and the adaptation to online went very well considering the fears that we had going in.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Sanya Kamidi, Arturo Martinez Rivera, Harper Lambert and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Shortly after the assault, Roe filed a police report with the Santa Barbara Police Department according to the motion, as well as a Title IX complaint one year later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, the Title IX office found Doe responsible for sexually assaulting Roe in 2015 and in violation of the UC’s sexual misconduct policies, according to the motion. In November 2017, the university sanctioned Doe with a three-year suspension and ruled he would be allowed to return in November 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe subsequently filed his petition to vacate the Title IX findings in January 2018, according to the motion. When he filed his petition to vacate the Title IX office’s findings in 2018, which was heard by the superior court, the court approved his petition and dismissed the findings in April 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the latest motion filed on June 9, Adams argues that the superior court only heard evidence from John Doe and the university when Doe filed his petition, but not from Roe or Roe’s lawyers. In addition, Roe had no knowledge that her case had been reopened nor that the superior court had ruled to vacate the Title IX office’s findings, according to Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”This is really not about Jane Roe. This is about all of the survivors out there who are completely left out of this process,” she added. “I’ve actually never heard of a situation in which they have included and notified the survivor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adams said this case speaks to the larger issue of due process and the misrepresentation of survivors in Title IX cases, of which there have been at least </span><a href=\"https://www.titleixforall.com/milestone-600-title-ix-due-process-lawsuits-in-behalf-of-accused-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">600 lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed on behalf of accused students in attempts to overturn their respective schools’ findings of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can absolutely say that the reason victims are left out of these cases is because the assailant or the accused person does not include them in the lawsuit,” Adams said. “So it is quite ironic to me that respondents in these cases are crying out for due process and then simultaneously robbing survivors, like our client, of the same in these cases.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roe’s motion is set to be heard in July, she said, but the other parties, Doe and the university, have a chance to respond to the motion before it is heard by a judge. Adams said she expects Doe to oppose the motion but is unsure if the university will follow suit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A big question will be whether the school will oppose our motion,” Adams said. “We would hope that the school would agree with us, that all students who are involved in these cases are entitled to notice of these filings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university declined to comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Hathaway, who represents Doe, did not respond to multiple requests for comment but provided to the Daily Nexus a copy of Doe’s opposition to motion to vacate, which was filed on June 18 in response to Doe’s previous motion to vacate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposition to motion to vacate alleges that the UC Regents “failed to provide a Title IX process that complied with California law” and argues that because neither Doe nor Roe are currently UCSB students, the matter is “moot” and does not require anymore administrative proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July’s hearing, the judge will decide whether or not to grant Roe’s motion, which could reverse the superior court’s previous decision to vacate the Title IX findings, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the judge doesn’t motion to vacate, Doe’s petition will stand and he would remain absolved from the Title IX findings. But if the judge does motion to vacate, Doe’s petition would be void and the original Title IX findings against Doe would stand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All parties — Doe, Roe and UCSB — will have the chance to appeal the judge’s upcoming July decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of any motion to appeal, from either party, has the potential to set legal precedent; the decision could determine how future cases define “real parties in interests,” which is a </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/real_party_in_interest\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">term</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to describe a person or entity who will be impacted by the outcome of legal action even if they are not explicitly defined as a party in the case, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should the court of appeals rule “that all survivors are real parties in interests who are entitled to notice of petition filings” and legal action, a new precedent could be set, which would mandate that all survivors in Title IX cases be included in future cases, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Roe been included as a real party in interest, Roe would have been notified when Doe filed his petition and when the court vacated the Title IX findings, Adams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement to the Nexus, Roe described how she felt excluded from the legal proceedings that voided the responsibility of sexual assault from her assaliant and emphasized the importance of changing the legal landscape to uplift — and include — the survivors’ voices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being excluded from the court’s legal proceedings made me feel like my voice had been completely taken away. It felt like the court didn’t care about my experience, and was just handing over the power and narrative of my story to my attacker,” Roe said. “I had no way to defend myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been about 5 years since my assault, and it feels ridiculous that I’m still fighting for my voice to be heard. But it’s important for me to know that I am also fighting for the rights of other survivors as well,” she said. “That’s why I want my story to make a difference.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

During the meeting, several Regents highlighted Drake’s extensive history in education, both within and outside the UC system — a sharp contrast to Napolitano, who came to the helm with no academic leadership experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano has served as UC president for the past seven years after previously serving as Secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and governor of Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents approved Drake’s salary at $890,000, according to a UC press release sent after the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents’ search committee held </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/the-uc-should-strive-for-better-students-faculty-and-stakeholders-share-suggestions-for-the-next-uc-president-at-ucla-public-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a> <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town</span></a> <a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">halls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at various UC campuses over the 2019-20 academic year during which students called on the Regents to choose a leader who would prioritize climate change and workers’ rights and provide a more equitable environment for all students, faculty and staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his remarks to the Regents, Drake touched upon the challenges for the university, including financial impacts from the coronavirus pandemic, demand for greater diversity and </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-07/academic-council-recommends-uc-to-defund-police-ban-police-firearms/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calls to defund UC police departments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC is among the few institutions worldwide best equipped to meet these challenges. Perhaps not to solve them and not to solve them single handedly, but to be fully engaged in finding solutions,” Drake said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani said that Drake will “steer the UC into a bold new era,” and lauded his experience in handling “budgetary challenges, issues of health and healthcare, racism and inclusion [and] policing and security.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael Drake’s commitment to graduate and undergraduate students, to the work of faculty, to understanding the centrality of all UC employees along with his very deep commitment to social mobility, is a joy to encounter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake attended Stanford University as an undergraduate, then received a medical degree from UC San Francisco. He served as the fifth chancellor of UC Irvine from 2005 to 2014 and the president of The Ohio State University from 2014 to the present. Drake is also board of governors chairman of the NCAA and a board member for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, according to the UC press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing — vice chair of the presidential search committee — said the competition for the position was steep, but Drake stood above his contenders for his history of innovation and commitment to diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things that was very important to us is somebody who’s ready on day one and Michael brings that quality because of his familiarity with UC,” she said. “When you look at what he did as chancellor [of UC Irvine] and at all the other jobs he had at Ohio State, you see that Michael is bold and he is capable of thinking outside of the box.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Drake’s “illustrious” career in education and a public announcement of retirement, Lansing said she was surprised that he took the position, but amounts it to Drake’s history with the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s doing this job simply because he loves UC.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

to families and children<strong>,</strong> the Isla Vista Youth Projects executive director will be retiring on Jan. 31, 2018. She will be leaving behind a legacy of improving the low-cost childcare services available to families in I.V.</p>\n<p>IVYP is a nonprofit organization that offers childcare and family education services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am fortunate in that my job is the perfect intersection of my passion, skillsets, faith, and calling,” Miller said. “I recognize how rare it is that I get up every day and love to go to work.”</p>\n<p>Miller has worked at the organization for so long because she believes every child should have the opportunity to access schooling regardless of socioeconomic status, residence or skin color.</p>\n<p>“I am lucky enough to work with the cutest kids in the world in such a supportive community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Originally hired as the I.V. preschool principal, Miller was promoted to executive director after one year and has held the position since 1986. She said she was originally terrified to accept the position.</p>\n<p>Over the course of her career, Miller has seen IVYP expand from a single classroom to a multi-site, multi-program agency throughout the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Miller’s proudest accomplishment is the national accreditation of the Children’s Center. The accreditation is particularly meaningful to her because the standards for approval are very high.</p>\n<p>Through her work with IVYP, Miller has seen many generations of families pass through the Children’s Center. Individuals that participated in the program as children have grown and returned to volunteer as adults and eventually enroll their own children, she says.</p>\n<p>She has many success stories with the children she works with, recalling that a young woman who enrolled in IVYP as a child graduated from UC Berkeley this past June. This, she says, is her favorite story because she is able to see the participants develop from infancy to college graduates.</p>\n<p>“This place gives our community the opportunity to know that a first-generation student going to college is very possible,” she said proudly.</p>\n<p>The facility on Phelps Road is equipped to serve children from the age of two to three months to preschool students. With 35 staff members and seven different classrooms, Miller has been instrumental in upgrading the facility during her time as director.</p>\n<p>The organization now has four facilities, including the Children’s Center on Phelps Road where many volunteers from UC Santa Barbara can gain teaching and childcare experience.</p>\n<p>“From holding babies, to one-on-one lessons with elementary-age children, IVYP had over 300 UCSB student volunteers this past school year for a total of over 600 volunteer hours,” Miller explained.</p>\n<p>As Miller’s time at IVYP comes to a close, she says her last project will be the creation of additional space for nine infants at the Children’s Center on UCSB’s West Campus.</p>\n<p>The project will cost approximately $20,000, and Miller said she hopes the community can collectively raise the funds. The Santa Barbara Foundation, a local philanthropic organization, has awarded IVYP $10,000 for the project.</p>\n<p>Miller said she is now eager to transition to a new period in her life. Though she will continue to do some consulting work for IVYP, she is looking forward to having more free time to spend with her family.</p>\n<p>“Life is precious, and I am now ready to relax after a great, long career,” she said.</p>\n<p>Miller will miss seeing the children each day but said she has faith in IVYP and believes it is organized by a “perfect group.”</p>\n<p>“It has always stayed true to its mission to serve I.V. and to stay in tune with what I.V. needs,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79093\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79093\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ivyps-luann-miller-set-to-retire-after-33-years-of-nonprofit-work/","id":3644,"author":{"id":245,"name":"Miranda O'Brien"},"related":[3643,3642,3641],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
