His performances and songs are still iconic today, and new waves of fans continue to admire his music with each generation.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, KCSB presented “Starman Under the Stars,” a tribute to Bowie’s legacy and the wide range of his talents. KCSB advisor and DJ Ted Coe explained, “KCSB has been doing the Sound and Vision series which has incorporated a week of special programing over the airwaves commemorating the life and work of David Bowie.”</p>\n<p>Part of the series was a double feature film screening on the lawn of the lagoon to celebrate two films starring the late performer. The first film, met with shouts of excitement, was “Labyrinth.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With its fairytale story infused with unnerving, gritty imagery,<em> “</em>Labyrinth” is a unique and stylized film that plays with the mysteriousness of fantasy. The film is dripping with ’80s cheesiness from the songs sung by puppets to the teased craziness that is Bowie’s hair. It’s these elements, however, that have made “Labyrinth” an ’80s icon, and no element of the film proves that more than David Bowie himself.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s role as the Goblin King perfectly melds the dramatics of his stage performances with the mysterious magic of the fantasy world. Bowie’s first appearance in the film clearly announces his presence as he stands sinisterly in a doorway, arms and dark flowing cape outstretched as thunder cracks behind him. A dusting of sparkles emitting from his direction adds the finishing touch of rock ‘n’ roll magic. Bowie commands each scene he is in with a smooth, confident tone, a calculating gaze and an occasional mysterious smirk that intimidates and beguiles.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s music throughout the film creates an otherworldly tone while still maintaining his signature style of rock. “Magic Dance” is catchy and upbeat with bursts of synthesizer and memorable lyrics about the magic and mystical. Bowie’s quick dance moves and taunting attitude showcase delightfully evil antics. “Within You” conveys a much more threatening tone, demonstrating the range of Bowie’s character and his own musical style. The beginning of the song is jarring and ominous, with sharp drum beats and guitar to match the sudden, terrifying appearance of the Goblin King and his quick, determined pace.</p>\n<p>The screen isn’t the only place Bowie’s talent shines. His performance in film is only matched by his presence on stage. The next film, “Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,” provides a look at Bowie’s eclectic performance style and music. The concert film highlights Bowie’s last performance as his Ziggy Stardust stage persona.</p>\n<p>Bowie’s vocal talent is clear in every song. The quick tempo of “Moonage Daydream” is accented by Bowie’s whispery low tones and clear high notes. Members of the audience are shown excitedly singing along as he holds out high notes and speaks toward them during the breaks in his songs. At the end of “Ziggy Stardust,” he pauses dramatically in front of the microphone in silence before belting out the last note of the song in a strong voice that commands attention.</p>\n<p>The iconic performances in this film show the unique way Bowie blended theatrics with music. At the beginning of “Time,” he appears with his arms outstretched with long, elegant white sleeves as two people suddenly rip his robe off of him to reveal a skin-tight, elaborately patterned bodysuit complete with a bright blue feather boa. In each song, he engages directly with the audience, pointing toward them dramatically and singing to various people.</p>\n<p>Andrew Kenny, a second-year and Bowie fan, said of the film, “I’m glad it wasn’t a normal documentary, because I’ve already seen two on him, so I don’t think there would have been too much new stuff to learn. It was fun to just sit through essentially like an entire concert experience.”</p>\n<p>David Bowie remains an important icon in music, movies and performance, and KCSB’s tribute only confirmed the appreciation and admiration of fans of all ages. From the magic of “Labyrinth” to the cool confidence of Ziggy Stardust, Bowie’s range of styles and performances is as impressive as it is entertaining. “Starman Under the Stars” proved that David Bowie is a star that will never fade.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Way to kick off Phase three, guys.</p>\n<p>What they did is nothing short of remarkable: They managed to make a film that, character-wise, is even larger in scale than “The Avengers,” and it works. There are more heroes, more motivations and more stories to tell than ever before, yet it never feels overstuffed or forced. “Civil War” puts Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in opposite ideological seats and sets them against each other. Each man comes up with valid points to back up their arguments, giving them motivation and lending actual believability to why they are fighting each other. Too bad it ended when Iron Man found out he and Cap’s mothers have the same name (I apologize to those who have heard that joke already ad nauseam).</p>\n<p>These two leading men predominantly take up the screen, but they also share it with oh so many welcome returns, the highlights being the wry Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who drops some dead-on one-liners on the members of Team Iron Man. Some character development is hinted at with Vision (Paul Bettany), ripe for growth in further sequels. Scarlett Witch also gets a really good mini-arc, but Elizabeth Olson apparently couldn’t decide between an American or Russian accent. When these guys all throw down, it’s absolutely glorious. It also speaks to the strength of the writing by showing that, despite their conflict, the Avengers don’t suddenly all hate each other. They’re still friends with different ideas, and you know what? That’s usually why friends fight. Bravo to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Also on the character front, some welcome fresh blood gets added to the mix. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther couldn’t have been brought into the fold better, even if he had debuted in his own solo origin film (which is coming in 2018). Developed, badass and quick-witted, he’s an awesome new addition to the lineup. Same for Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (whose solo arrives 2017). Unlike Maguire and Garfield, Holland actually feels like a high-schooler. That’s not just because the actor is younger; he has actual concerns and personality traits beholden to a teen. And he’s fun! Spider-Man is fun again! And funny too! Boy, way to stick it to Sony. And to Joss Whedon, showing how not to overdo it on the quips.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the villain, Zemo. Although I am still a little confused about how he managed to do what he did, in retrospect (five hours post screening, to be precise), I am particularly impressed with the character. Unlike previous Marvel big bads, he’s not a dark mirror of the protagonist or a warlord commanding vast armies. Defying expectations even for the characters, he’s just a normal, albeit clever man out for sweet revenge. Yet he is able to set the Avengers against each other and have them dance in the palm of his hand. Hope Loki’s taking notes.</p>\n<p>As much as I would prefer not to do this, I have to directly compare <em>“</em>Civil War<em>” </em>to “Age of Ultron” here for a moment. A major reason why “Age of Ultron,” while not a complete failure, was a disappointment in the fact that it felt completely bereft of character development (stupid shoehorned romances aside). At no point was I convinced to give a shit about what was happening to the Avengers. I found myself much more invested in the personal conflicts of “Civil War,” which besides still being a frenetic and fun action romp tells a really good story about strained friendships. There’s actual heart here. So Russos? Markus? McFeely? Thank you. Don’t fuck up the “Infinity Wars.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/civil-war-brings-wehrung-peace/","id":5874,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5873,5872,5871],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Debugging the Gender Gap with Code","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CODE_poster_011816.jpg?resize=355%2C222&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CODE_poster_011816.jpg?resize=397%2C222&ssl=1","description":"Growing up, women are often told that they won’t like math, science or coding — or perhaps they are told that they aren't good enough.

This documentary has won 14 awards and has been screened worldwide. After the film ended there was a panel of five others to discuss the issues brought up during the screening. Those five panelists are: Cornelia Davis, Karen K. Myers, Maria Charles, Amr El Abbadi and Cynthia Stool (the moderator, so-to-speak).</p>\n<p>“Code” discusses women in S.T.E.M. — specifically women who are coders. The documentary sheds light on how women are brought up differently from men and are automatically deterred from S.T.E.M. Growing up, women are often told that they won’t like math, science or coding — or perhaps they are told that they aren’t good enough. When people are told something enough they start to believe it. The difference between men and women here is that men aren’t told that they aren’t good enough at math while women, generally, deal with that on a frequent basis.</p>\n<p>Reynolds interviewed several groups that promote women to engage in coding. Several of the groups focus on women of color or young children. According to “Code,” several countries have already made it mandatory to incorporate coding into the curriculum for children at a young age — while here, in the U.S., it isn’t even available at all schools. Availability of these types of courses greatly effect who can get into the field at a young age.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was interesting to find out how universal a skill like coding is. It is not just a tool strictly for S.T.E.M. majors — it can be used in artistic fields as well. One person interviewed in “Code,” Danielle Feinberg, expressed her love for both art and coding. Feinberg is a visual effects artist for Pixar; she showed how coding was used to animate Merida’s hair in the movie “Brave<em>.</em>” On top of animation, coding can be used for web design, video games, etc. The people interviewed all emphasized the need for more women in the field.</p>\n<p>Something that came up during the panelists’ discussion was the lack of availability of coding courses. There were a few professors and students in the audience from S.T.E.M. departments at UCSB that had a few words to say on this issue — including Professor Amr El Abbadi. The issue is that the class sizes for coding courses at UCSB are too small; they are filled up mostly by incoming freshmen, and primarily male ones at that. Several professors agree that women usually find interest after taking an intro course in the field once in college, but are unable to get into the major due to the lack of space. This created a large discussion in which no answers or possible solutions were found other than sustaining funding.</p>\n<p>A student brought up the fact that there are approximately 20 spots for new majors to transfer into the field after already having started college. Professor Amr El Abbadi expressed his frustration with the school assigning coding classes extremely small classrooms. He said that he can fit about 30-38 students in one room, but then there are another 30-38 students on the waitlist that cannot get in.</p>\n<p>Reynolds really made an eye-opening documentary. She even brought up the fact that it’s hard to get women to join the field especially when they become likely to be sexually harassed. She interviewed one women in particular who shared her story about being sexualized in the workplace. It got to the point where it was so bad that she left her job — and even then she was cyber-bullied/sexually harassed by her ex-co-workers.</p>\n<p>I barely scratched the surface of “Code: Debugging the Gender Gap<em>.</em>” One major issue the film covers is the issue of not having a diverse team. Not having a diverse team (i.e. just having men) can lead to accidents or certain issues getting overlooked. So if you ever have the opportunity to watch it, take it. It is really enlightening and educational. It sheds light on how important it is to diversify the coding institution and to include more women.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

that has been constantly cycled year after year when looking at industries such as military, media, entertainment and politics (especially during presidential elections; Republican candidate Mitt Romney famously said he had “binders full of women” in 2012 when responding to a question about pay equality). Recently, however, it seems these traditionally perceived “boys’ club” sectors are experiencing a disruption, not because the “boys” are opening the doors, but due in part to more opportunities for women to learn how to better promote themselves.</p>\n<p>In the media sector, the numbers are the story. According to the <a href=\"http://www.grady.uga.edu/annualsurveys/Enrollment_Survey/Enrollment_2013/2013EnrollCombined.pdf\"><em>2013 Annual Survey of Journalism and Mass Communication Enrollment</em></a>, two-thirds of the students enrolled in journalism programs nationwide are women, but they have still been underrepresented in the newsroom for many years, especially at the executive and management levels.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Hosted by the Film &amp; Media Studies Dept., the speakers not only emphasized the growing roles of women in the entertainment and media industries but also offered attendees tips and insights for pursuing careers in technology, film, television and media.</p>\n<p>The conference kicked off Saturday with Sara Caputo, founder of the consulting and training business Radiant Organizing, moderating a panel called “Taking Charge,” featuring human resource expert Karen Boublis, jeweler and online marketing strategist Calla Gold, negotiation consultant and executive coach Lisa Gates and public speaker Lisa Braithwaite.</p>\n<p>Besides maintaining authenticity during networking sessions, distinguishing between assertiveness and aggressiveness, achieving confidence, framing strengths and skill sets into value propositions and negotiating, “Taking Charge” offered guidance on how to make, keep and utilize industry connections. Not only were the speakers excited to share their advice, they also understood that networking, while essential in the entertainment sector known for “who you know,” does not come naturally.</p>\n<p>“If you’re uncomfortable with starting a conversation, do what I do — I give away gifts!” said Gold as she tossed small bags into the audience. “Now there’s a conversation starter for ya, but be sure your card is part of that gift, and don’t be shy talking about what you do and asking them what they do.” Sure enough, a business card for Calla Gold Jewelry along with a pair of earring backs were found in the bag.</p>\n<p>Although mastering the art of negotiation, networking and self-presentation is a major key to success, knowing one’s core values and ambitions is crucial since they help an individual navigate the career path. Sheila Sullivan, associate director of the Carsey-Wolf Center, helped students tackle this subject in “How To Get There.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the session, Sullivan directed attendees’ attention to the job interview: organizing and explaining a variety of interview questions, providing tips on how to stand out and emphasizing the importance of researching the desired position, interviewee, business and industry. As practice, volunteers from the audience would sit in the “hot seat” in the front of the room, where Sullivan ran through some practice interview questions and gave tips on how to improve afterward.</p>\n<p>“It reminded me of doing theater in high school, except instead of workshopping a scene, it was my life,” said second-year communication major Shanna Benji, who was the first to volunteer. “It was a little bit nerve-wracking, but I think it was beneficial to me in the long run. I’m glad it was done in there instead of with an actual interview.”</p>\n<p>Succeeding Sullivan was Kathy Wertheim, a certified fundraising executive teaching people “how to ask for money and get it.” While elaborating on the conference’s running themes of networking and negotiation, she stressed the importance of developing confidence in all aspects of career development.</p>\n<p>“People will take advantage of you ’cause you’re nice,” Wertheim said. “If you can move a little bit off of ‘nice,’ it helps enormously. The world doesn’t collapse when you’re direct.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Breaking In </strong></p>\n<p>The final panel of the day, “You Do What!?!,” featured publicist and crowdfunding consultant Brittany Sandler, newly hired assistant to “Vinyl” showrunner Scott Z. Burns, Brittany Vu, anonymous content attorney Laura Foody, editor Andulka “Annie” Wilkes, set lighting technician and best boy electric Stephanie Choi and cinematographer Lauren Haroutunian. The UCSB alumni discussed how to break into the entertainment industry’s production and creative sides and also touched upon Hollywood’s gender myths, particularly one regarding the lack of interested women in this “friends’ club” or “boys’ club.”</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve noticed,” Haroutunian said, “is that when they say, ‘We’re looking to hire X, Y and Z,’ they send it out to their buds, and then they’re like, ‘No women applied. Why did no women apply? Well, we tried.’”</p>\n<p>“There are a ton of women hungry for work and fighting to get that work. If you really want to hire women, you have to go and find those women,” Haroutunian added.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Beyond College, What’s Your Story?</strong></p>\n<p>Wertheim returned for day two to present a crash course on “How To Adult.” From managing finances to work and personal relationships, Wertheim imparted words of wisdom to help students prepare for adult life after college. Attendees performed various exercises such as practicing the perfect handshake and participating in a “rejection party” where they received and gave rejections in a variety of hypothetical work-related situations.</p>\n<p>“Checking … checking … nobody’s bleeding on the floor,” Wertheim said, scanning the room after the rejection party broke up. “‘No’ didn’t kill you. Rejection isn’t fatal.”</p>\n<p>In the “Finding Your Voice” session, award-winning producer and educator Marie Cantin upheld that everyone had a story to tell, even though oftentimes it took large amounts of luck in an ongoing process to find it.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be different for every person,” Cantin said. “Some people have lots of stories to tell; some people only have one. Some people tell the same story over and over again.”</p>\n<p>Once people find their stories, the next step is to tell it. Maker Studios’ artists and repertoire specialist Hilary Michaels, YouTuber Holly Conrad, writer and artist Mia Resella and author Laura Horwitz (all former Gauchos) gave advice on building a unique voice, promoting one’s passion and staying genuine while interviewing for jobs.</p>\n<p>“If you are you and they’re looking for you, then you already got the job,” Resella said.</p>\n<p>The final panel of the weekend, titled “Leading Ladies,” was moderated by journalist Starshine Roshell and featured Karen Horne, senior vice president of programming talent development and inclusion for NBC Entertainment and Universal Television Studios, along with television writers Jane Espenson and Anne Cofell Saunders. When asked if being a woman brought anything unique to writing, show running or executive production, Saunders responded that she doesn’t think of herself as a woman while working.</p>\n<p>“I don’t self-actualize myself before I pitch, ‘I’m pitching this as a woman,’” Saunders said. “I just pitch it as myself.”</p>\n<p>Still, the panelists recognized that diversity plays a crucial role in the business and in storytelling.</p>\n<p>“It’s diversity of experience, not just diversity in gender or sexual diversity,” Horne said. “If we have those differences of experiences, it makes us much richer storytellers.”</p>\n<p>Overall, WIM was a fantastic event full of informative and practical sessions and activities that not only addressed the state of Hollywood’s gender gap, but also how to prepare for the work and adult life that awaits after college.</p>\n<p>Kirsten “Cookie” Pierre, who is part of the WIM planning committee, is certain that WIM will continue after this year.</p>\n<p>“We hope that more people hear about the new event from all majors and participate next year, since everything shared will be helpful for not just women and men going into the film industry, but everyone!” Pierre said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Still an Uphill Battle but Making Progress</strong></p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/CARDReport%20FINAL%2022216.ashx\">USC Study</a> finds that while about half of the film school graduates are women, they directed only 1.9 percent of the highest grossing 100 films in the period from 2013 to 2014.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, according to film &amp; media academic advisor Joe Palladino, roughly 53 percent of the department’s enrollment is comprised of women. In acting as a loose advisor for WIM, Palladino recognized that women had a very big presence in the department at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a time in the department where a lot of the student clubs — the Filmmakers’ Co-op, the Writers Room, Reel Loud, The Limitless Coalition — were all being run by women,” Palladino said.</p>\n<p>He adds, “We look at representations in the Oscars, representations of directors that are out there making feature films … It’s not good. We need to change.”</p>\n<p>In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow made history when she became the first woman to win an Academy Award for Best Director for “The Hurt Locker,” which follows an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in the Iraq War.</p>\n<p>When “Zero Dark Thirty” was released in 2012, it was not just an enthralling account of the CIA’s operation to eliminate Osama Bin Ladin, but also another breakthrough for women in Hollywood. Helmed by Bigelow, this Oscar nominated spy thriller was also led by main star Jessica Chastain, whose character is a composite of real female agents at the CIA (another “boys’ club” bastion) and overseen by Amy Pascal, who was then president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, parent company of “Zero Dark Thirty’s” film distributor Columbia Pictures.</p>\n<p>So, it’s safe to say in the 21st century, it’s a poor excuse to say qualified women are none to be found, as they are everywhere in big numbers and ready to go.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70966\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/film-media-dept-hosts-inaugural-women-in-media-conference/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70966\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/film-media-dept-hosts-inaugural-women-in-media-conference/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/film-media-dept-hosts-inaugural-women-in-media-conference/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/film-media-dept-hosts-inaugural-women-in-media-conference/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-13/film-media-dept-hosts-inaugural-women-in-media-conference/","id":5876,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5875,5874,5873],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
