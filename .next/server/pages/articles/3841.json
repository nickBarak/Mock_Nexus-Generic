Four people are still missing.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire weakened the ground in Montecito, making it <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/evacuation-orders-issued-as-winter-storm-threatens-potential-flooding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">susceptible to flooding</a> and unable to absorb the water from last week’s storm.</p>\n<p>The loss of vegetation due to the Thomas Fire, as well as last year’s Whittier, Sherpa and Rey fires, also increased the risk of flash flooding and debris. Without vegetation, rain that would generally cause very little runoff resulted in erosion and fatal flooding throughout the Montecito area.</p>\n<p>Caltrans reopened the 101 freeway on Jan. 21.

Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her. Maybe she was being cooperative,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Authorities took the woman’s contact information and plan to ask the owner of the vehicle if they want to press charges at a later date.</p>\n<p>Officers handled a typical number of alcohol-related crimes over the weekend. Eight individuals were arrested for public intoxication and nine were issued minor in possession citations. Deputies also issued 10 citations for possession of open containers.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/","id":3839,"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer"},"related":[3838,3837,3836],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All that glitters is not gold…","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>All that glitters is not gold…</p>\n<p>Friday, May 28, 11:49 p.m. — While Isla Vista’s finest were cruising down the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road in a patrol vehicle, they noticed a male UCSB student lying on top of a bike in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Two girls were helping the 19-year-old off the ground, who had somehow managed to misplace his shirt and was covered with glitter paint across his entire face and body. Deputies approached the Good Samaritans, who noted that they didn’t know their new shimmer-coated comrade.</p>\n<p>Cops asked the glittery Gaucho if he was alright and if he had fallen off of his bicycle, to which he was merely able to nod in response. Upon questioning, the sloshed student said that he thought he had taken a tumble on Del Playa Drive and that it was 2 a.m. He couldn’t tell the officers where he lived and was also incapable of standing upright without leaning on the patrol vehicle for balance.</p>\n<p>Because the twinkling teenager was unable to care for his own safety, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-24474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-06-03/police-blotter-58/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-24474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-06-03/police-blotter-58/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-06-03/police-blotter-58/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-06-03/police-blotter-58/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-06-03/police-blotter-58/","id":3840,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3839,3838,3837],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
