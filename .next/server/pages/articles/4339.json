Although it lost its final series, Santa Barbara still has a solid chance of making the 64-team NCAA tournament thanks to its fourth straight 30-plus win season. The Highlanders finish their 2016 campaign 26-29 overall, 12-12 Big West and finish tied for fourth in the conference standings, their best finish in the conference since 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB closed the season on Saturday at home but had a very disappointing outcome, as it was shut out for only the second  time this season with the final score being 6-0. It was also disappointing for the two seniors, third baseman Ryan Clark and pitcher Justin Kelly, as they lost their final home game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The guys were trying but UCR played really well,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We couldn’t capitalize on some plays. It was one of those games.”</p>\n<p>UCR took an early 1-0 lead after the first inning; then both teams traded scoreless innings until the fourth. The Highlanders then blew the game open in the fourth and fifth innings as they scored two runs in both innings to take a 5-0 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>After adding one more run in the eighth inning, which would be the final run of the game for both teams, the game felt out of reach not just because of the 6-0 scoreboard but because of the lack of consistency on the Gauchos’ side.</p>\n<p>UCSB combined for only five hits on Saturday compared to UCR’s 11. Three of Santa Barbara’s biggest hitters, redshirt junior Andrew Calica, redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno and sophomore Austin Bush, had a terrible day as they combined to go 0-12.</p>\n<p>Clark and Kelly had decent outings in their final home games of their careers. Clark was one of only four Gaucho hitters to register a hit on the evening, while Kelly went 2 2/3 innings deep striking out four batters while also surrendering four hits and two earned runs.</p>\n<p>For UCR, junior Mark Contreras had a solid day going 3-5 (.600) with one RBI and freshman infielder Yeager Taylor hit his third home run of the season to end his first year on a high note.</p>\n<p>Before a frustrating loss to end the season, UCSB’s Shane Beiber battled hard for his team on the mound and led his team to a 2-1 victory to tie the series up for the time being.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was in control for most of the game as it scored one run in the second after an error by the visiting team and one in the forth after redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit an RBI single to score catcher Dempsey Grover.</p>\n<p>Beiber was also amazing for his duration as he pitched an almost full game. In his 8.2 innings, the right-hander allowed six hits and one earned run, which came in the top of the ninth.</p>\n<p>UCR attempted to make its comeback in the ninth inning as redshirt senior Drake Zarate hit a home run to make the score 2-1. After the home run, the Gauchos brought in their ace reliever, redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson, to get the final out which he successfully did to get his eighth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Beiber picked up his Big West best 11th win of the season and became the first UCSB pitcher to pick up that many wins in a season since 1983. It was also his 22nd career victory, which is tied for third best in program history.</p>\n<p>Before that solid victory, the Gauchos started the series off the wrong way as they played a sluggish game that led to a frustrating and disappointing 3-1 loss.</p>\n<p>UCR got off to a quick start as Contreras hit a sac fly RBI to get his team on the scoreboard first. In the fifth frame, the Highlanders added two more runs thanks to junior Aaron Cisneros’ RBI single and Taylor’s sac fly RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded with a run in the bottom half of the fifth courtesy of Calica’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>However, that would be the only life UCSB could find all day as in the final four innings it was shutout not only on the scoreboard but on the hit column as it could not muster a measly single.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Sodders had a great game for UCR picking up his sixth win of the season after allowing only six hits all game and one run in seven full innings of play. Alex Fagalde finished the game in the ninth to pick up his third save of the season.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos had arguably their worst weekend of the season as they only scored three runs in three games while only registering 17 hits.</p>\n<p>It definitely was not something the team wanted to have as postseason play approaches, but it did, and UCSB will try to power forward and try to do some damage if it gets into the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have to come back together and play well.” Checketts said. “Some guys are getting frustrated and we just have to regroup.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA will announce their 64-team tournament at 9 a.m. PST Monday, May 30.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The all-time series record between these two teams is also split at 7-7.</p>\n<p>While this game may look like an easy one on paper, it is important that UCSB does not overlook its opponents. Although it has struggled, CSUB still has the necessary pieces to make games interesting.</p>\n<p>Leading the offensive charge is redshirt junior outfielder Dustin Frailey who leads the team in batting average (.454), in on-base percentage (.545), and slugging percentage (.667). He is also one of two players to hit a home run this season.</p>\n<p>Helping Frailey lead the charge is David Metzgar. The junior currently leads the team in RBI with 17 while also batting a solid .329, good for third on the team.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Gauchos will most likely face junior Max Carter. The right hander has struggled this season having an 0-2 record while posting an 11.05 ERA. Carter has allowed nine runs in 7.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Carter, if he wants to turn around his season he will have to do it against one of the hottest teams in college baseball right now.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are led by first baseman Austin Bush who is second on the team in batting average (.370), first in hits (20), and first in RBI (19).</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had a great season thus far winning Tournament MVP honors in San Diego, named Big West POTW, and most recently hit a walk-off home run to give his team a victory. While Bush’s performance has been great he has also received tremendous help from a slew of players.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomores JJ Muno and Josh Adams lead the team in home runs (3), while redshirt junior Andrew Calica leads the team in on-base percentage (.517). Catcher Grover Dempsey, another redshirt sophomore, leads the team in batting average (.422) and slugging percentage (.600).</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara is the clear favorite to win this game, however, it would be smart to not fall into a trap game. Although it has had an amazing start to the season, a loss to an inferior opponent could hurt all the positive attention it has garnered thus far.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also need to be sure to not be intimidated by an away crowd as this season they are 1-2 away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against CSU Bakersfield today at 6 p.m. at Hardt Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

id=\"caption-attachment-74749\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Children at IVYP’s Children Center are relaxing on the carpet. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I am so excited to be selected as the new ED for IVYP,” Goodman said in an email. “I strongly believe that investing in children, providing them with all [they] need to learn, to be emotionally secure and to be successful is the best investment we can make as a society.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s assignment will begin Jan. 28, following the retirement of Executive Director LuAnn Miller after 30 years of work. The organization itself was founded in 1971 by community members after riotous protests that resulted in the burning of the Bank of America in I.V.</p>\n<p>Goodman said that she wants to expand on Miller’s legacy. She described Miller as an “authentic, caring and competent leader” who grew the IVYP “from a small child care center to the diverse and impactful organization it is today.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s optimism reflects her passion for the program. She said that her main goal currently is to learn everything about the IVYP, from her duties to the people, programs and partners that surround the agency.</p>\n<p>She explained that one of the major challenges she expects to face during her first few months is funding, as with many nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>“Most of IVYP’s budget comes through the California State Department of Education,” she said. “I have a lot to learn about how that funding works, but my experience with governmental funding is that it rarely pays enough to provide the salary and benefits that teachers deserve.”</p>\n<p>She also described IVYP’s relationship to UCSB as “unique” especially as an increase in UCSB admission rates will affect housing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As UCSB moves forward in its plan to enroll more students, that will likely impact housing and services in Isla Vista. Anticipating those changes and ensuring that children and families are not forgotten will be part of my agenda,” she said.</p>\n<p>In the future, she wants to focus on spreading awareness about IVYP and its comprehensive role both in and out of the community.</p>\n<p>“More people should know what we’re doing. We serve children and families in I.V. and Goleta, but our leadership can and should be recognized far and wide,” she said.</p>\n<p>As Miller prepares to conclude her long career at IVYP, she remains grateful for the ability to have genuinely enjoyed every day of work over a span of 33 years. She began at IVYP as a teacher and assumed the role of executive director a year later.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been blessed with the perfect intersection of education, skill set, passion and faith: the ability to do meaningful work to make a difference in our community,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>The next stages in Miller’s life include plans for traveling, cooking, focusing on her health and enjoying time with her husband.</p>\n<p>“I hope I will be remembered as someone who led with heart and head,” she said. “Someone who believed that all the children and families deserve equal access to education, safety, health and respect… someone who truly enjoyed the energy, vibrancy and goodness in Isla Vista that is often missed up those outside the community.”</p>\n<p>Miller hopes that Goodman will fall in love with IVYP.</p>\n<p>“At IVYP, we are working to address the root causes of so many societal problems. When we have strong, whole children and families, our community thrives. What could be more important than that?” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Goodman is also no stranger to community service. She previously worked at Child Abuse Listening &amp; Mediation (C.A.L.M.), where she served as chief development officer and as a member of the senior management team.</p>\n<p>She has also previously worked as a camp counselor, program director, day care monitor, teacherand youth group advisor.</p>\n<p>Goodman has a deep connection with the I.V. community through her tight-knit family. Her son attends UCSB and her husband, Rabbi Evan Goodman, serves the campus through Santa Barbara Hillel. With the new gig, Goodman joked, she can now meet with her spouse for lunch at Freebirds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/","id":4337,"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno"},"related":[4336,4335,4334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Secure Third in Conf.

RPI is used to rank sports teams based upon a team’s wins and losses and its strength of schedule, which currently stands at 19, the best of any team on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>Although slim, it is possible that UCSB could also jump up to second place in the conference standings if it were to sweep UCR, in addition to a series loss by Long Beach State, who is currently in second place in the conference.</p>\n<p>For the Highlanders, this weekend will be their last regardless of the outcome. Although they have won series over quality opponents such as LBSU and Cal Poly, they have not been consistent enough to be a great team. UCR has lost six of seven matches twice this season.</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos need to watch out for is junior outfielder Vince Fernandez, who was recently named Big West Player of the Week for his performance this past weekend in which he batted 10-19 (.526), scored six runs and batted in six over the course of four games.</p>\n<p>Fernandez currently leads the team in batting average (.361), slugging percentage (.529), on-base percentage (.439), runs scored (39), hits (75), RBI (41), home runs (8) and walks (28).</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to counter with strong hitters of their own such as sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in RBI (43) and home runs (7). When its hitting is on point, Santa Barbara looks nearly unstoppable. In the 20 games this season UCSB has gotten at least 10 hits; it has been able to come away with victories in 17 of those occasions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also look to take advantage of the fact they are at home since they have scored 166 runs at home this season compared to 94 on the road. They also bat and get on base 60 points better at home while also pitching an ERA of 3.70 at home, which is much better compared to 4.49. It also helps that they are currently 23-4 at home as opposed to 10-12-1 on the road.</p>\n<p>Crunch time has finally arrived for the No. 19 team in the country and now is the time to put up or shut up. Although it will be another year without celebrating a Big West championship, Santa Barbara has accomplished a lot this season and it would be a shame if it blew its opportunity to make consecutive NCAA regionals because it decided not to show up in the final weekend of the regular season.</p>\n<p>The season has come down to the final weekend and it will be interesting to see which Gaucho team shows up: the young, inexperienced one, or the one that is ready to prove all the doubters wrong.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCR in its regular season finale at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Thursday, May 26 at 3 p.m., Friday, May 27 at 3 p.m. and Saturday, May 28 at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 26, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
