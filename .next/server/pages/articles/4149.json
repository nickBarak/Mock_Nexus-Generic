The old Ike’s building is newer – the infrastructure and everything is better. Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V. I go walk around at different times of day and observe the busiest parts. Trigo is dead on the weekends, and the busiest street is Pardall and the area where Woodstock’s is. Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/amidst-lawsuit-ikes-moves-to-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues between the sandwich shop and the property manager, Icon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the reported presence of mold at the location, led owner Ike Shehadeh to pack up shop and move to State Street. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As stated before, hitting is contagious, and this group of guys could not have picked a better time to catch this fever as they head into conference.</p>\n<p>On top of a firing-on-all-cylinders offense, UCSB’s starters have been pitching with authority as well. Besides a rough outing from ace Noah Davis last weekend, starters Kyle Nelson, Chris Clements, and Ben Bretch are coming off their best outings of the year as they head into the series against the Dirt Bags.</p>\n<p>The only real concern is in every one of the great performances each ace threw their highest pitch counts of the season and went later into games than ever before.  Regardless, UCSB has all the momentum of both sides of the ball going into this series, which could turn out to be a difference maker throughout Big West play this year.</p>\n<p>However, the month of March was not all smiles for UCSB. The Gauchos will need to replace the productivity of the great junior shortstop Clay Fisher who is out for the year after undergoing Tommy John Surgery, and previous Sunday ace starter Joe Record.</p>\n<p>Despite the home team hosting this series with a ton of momentum on its side, Long Beach State is certainly has been producing as of late as well.

In fact, Long Beach St. has several things actually working against them this weekend that others might not see.</p>\n<p>During their past 10 games, five of LBSU’s eight wins have come from very close games with scores within at least two runs of each other. Each of these five wins could have gone either way, but to the Dirtbags credit, they know how to win close games with their entire team.</p>\n<p>Nobody in particular has been amazing. Regardless, the big three hitters to watch out for are Ramsey Romano (.360, 1 HR, 14 RBI), Lucas Tancas (.347, 2 HR, 11 RBI), and David Banueios (.312, 4 HR, 17 RBI) as these guys have been consistent all season long for the most part.</p>\n<p>For their starters, only one has an ERA below 4, which belongs to Junior RHP Darren McCaughan (3.48 ERA, 41.1 IP, 16 ER, 5 HR, 37 SO). The Dirt Bag’s pitching overall has been less than impressive.</p>\n<p>The away record for the Dirt Bags is something to be weary of as well. Long Beach is 5-9 on the road this year, while the Gauchos have held an impressive record at home of 8-3.</p>\n<p>But how about this, the most impactful part of this weekend’s matchup might not even have anything to do with the Gauchos. The Dirtbags have played a total of five games in five days. When they play UCSB? Well, that will be six games in six days. By the end of the series, Long Beach St. will have played eight games in eight days. Without a doubt, the Dirt Bags will be playing tired baseball. Their pitching staff is already heavily used up before this series even begins and their position players will be on heavy legs on defense and in the box. The scheduling and timing of this series</p>\n<p>By the end of the series, Long Beach St. will have played eight games in eight days and will without a doubt have a negative impact on Long Beach State. Their pitching staff is already heavily used up before this series even begins and their position players will be on heavy legs on defense and in the box. The scheduling and timing of this series is going to help out the Gauchos exponentially.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces LBSU to begin Big West conference play at 3 p.m. on Friday, March 31st at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/","id":4146,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

As a student, Macias said she believes that art is commodified and generally something people cannot enjoy unless they have excess funds to pay for expensive art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just look at romance painters,” Macias said. “They were always court painters. They did portraits for royalty. They did marble statues, they painted churches, so [art] has always been a commission-based thing and it has always been commissioned by higher classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led Macias to research ways to share her art with the “broke college kids” around her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to make her art more accessible, Macias puts her art on stickers, with sizes to fit Hydroflasks and lighters, and she creates poetry and art for Um…Magazine, an online student-run publication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias has fallen in love with the I.V. art community and is an artist who believes even college students should be able to appreciate art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that is what I really like about I.V. art movements. It is so inclusive,” said Macias. She found UCSB to be elitist when it comes to art projects, only allowing incredibly skilled artists to produce art around campus, yet I.V. is welcoming to all skill levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in her free time, Macias has taken up denim painting commissions – an unconventional art form not often seen in I.V. She charges between $20 and $35 for the art, depending on whether the buyer provides their own denim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like painting denim, not only because it is an easy way to get my art affordably out there, but also I feel like it makes my art mobile,” Macias explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend moving to Germany in July could not take acrylic paints with her onto the plane, so she gifted them to Macias a couple months before she left. Without a canvas and disliking the look of acrylics on paper, Macias painted on denim for the first time in the spring, adding flowers to her mother’s jacket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The denim jacket] was the coolest thing and it didn’t have any marks on it or anything. I had it all throughout high school,” Macias said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that painting on denim is surprisingly difficult in contrast to her familiar watercolors, which she considers to be the most forgiving medium due to water always being able to change the image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with denim’s rough surface, the paint needs to be combined with a mixing medium and sealed with heat to make it last through a wash, and many layers of paint are needed to produce a bright color. Macias also found that her line work needs to be more precise with acrylics than with watercolors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias noticed that people were afraid to alter their own clothing but still wanted to have personalized art, which Macias said is why she chooses to create commission-based denim rather than selling original denim creations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t feel like they have the time or the energy or skill to create something but that doesn’t mean they can’t. They just need other ways to get there and that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t reap the benefits of their own creative mind.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every girl has a pair of high-waisted jeans in their drawer,” Macias said. “Some of them are booty shorts, some of them are cut-off, but they all have some pair of high waisted denim shorts somewhere and it’s just like, ‘Why don’t you paint the back pocket?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She often encourages people to paint with her if they want to try it out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you could do that or you want to do that, then sit here and try it with me at least, and if we mess up, Livi can try to fix your shorts,” said Macias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with Vincent van Gogh’s famous paintings “Starry Night” and “Café Terrace at Night,” Macias finds emotion to be an important part of art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His most beautiful works were actually made when he was in recovery,” Macias explained. She added that she is troubled by society’s romanticization of mental illness and creation and finds many believe Van Gogh and other celebrated creators would not have been as gifted or talented without their mental illnesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He portrays entire emotions of happiness and hope in those just by the use of color,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her inspiration comes from whatever she is feeling at the moment with the paper she has on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias’ previous art pieces range across many emotions, from darker works about drug use and overdose to cuter, summer works with bright yellows and golds. She keeps various notebooks with each featuring a different theme, often with as many as twenty notebooks partially filled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Art is expression…and that’s what I really want to portray in what I do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:
