They are currently playing the worst baseball they have all season after going 2-5 in the last seven games, and with three of those losses coming at home, a place where UCSB had only lost once this season prior to this current stretch of games.</p>\n<p>The Titans are now 32-17 overall with a 14-4 Big West record, good for first place in the standings. With six games remaining in conference play, CSUF now has a three-game lead over second place LBSU — who they have yet to play — and a four-game lead over UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sunday’s game was a big one for the Gauchos, as they still had a chance to win the series over a very good Fullerton team. They also needed to bounce back from an embarrassing 18-2 loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara started off the game slow, allowing two runs in the first inning to Fullerton. CSUF then extended its lead to 3-0 after adding a run in the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos finally struck back as a two-RBI double by junior utility player Billy Fredrick brought them back to within one run.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning, UCSB tied the game at 3-3 after a solid RBI double from redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford.</p>\n<p>Although three runs were enough to win Friday’s game, it was not enough to beat the Titans on Sunday, as they rallied off one run to take a 4-3 in the seventh courtesy of a wild pitch from redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson.</p>\n<p>After that, CSUF never looked back. In the eighth inning they scored two more runs to take a 6-3 lead after an error by the UCSB second baseman scored two Fullerton runners.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went cold the last three innings, mustering only one hit, which led to their eventual 6-3 loss.</p>\n<p>Nelson (6-1) picked up his first loss of the season after allowing the go-ahead run in the seventh. On the CSUF side, junior pitchers Dylan Prohoroff (1-1) and Scott Serigstad combined to allow only one hit in the final 3.1 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Before losing the series on a tough game, Santa Barbara suffered its worst loss of the season after being blown out on their home turf by a final score of 18-2.</p>\n<p>The Titans were able to score at least one run in seven of the nine innings of the match and their seven-run outburst — which came when they were already up 7-2 — in the sixth inning is what put away the Gauchos for good.</p>\n<p>The 18-run, 21-hit game allowed by the Gauchos is the most they allowed all season in both those categories, with their 16-run loss being their worst run differential loss of the year.</p>\n<p>CSUF designated hitter Ruben Cardenas had a career day, setting career highs in hits and RBIs. The freshman went 4-6 (.667) with six RBIs, three runs scored and a big two-run homer in the seventh inning, his second of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman Tanner Pinkston also had a great game, going 4-5 (.800) with three RBIs and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the nine innings, Titan pitchers combined to allow only four hits and two runs while striking out seven batters. Nothing went right for the Gauchos on either end of the mound.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s embarrassing loss, UCSB actually managed to gain the early advantage on CSUF after sneaking by with a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the second inning as redshirt sophomore third baseman J.J. Muno hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Titans responded in the fourth inning after junior infielder Timmy Richards hit his team high eighth home run of the season to tie the game up at one.</p>\n<p>UCSB then hit another home run, this one courtesy of freshman catcher Sam Cohen — the first of his career — to re-take a one run lead at 2-1.</p>\n<p>CSUF tied the game at two after another RBI from Richards, but the Gauchos freshman infielder Tevin Mitchell hit an RBI ground out to take the 3-2 lead after the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Nelson then picked up his sixth save of the season after pitching the final two frames, allowing only one hit.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber (9-3) pitched a great game, allowing only six hits and two runs in seven innings pitched while also striking out six batters. The win gave him the 20th of his career, and he is now tied for eighth in UCSB program history for career wins.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara squandered an amazing opportunity to really move up the rankings and break the slump it has been in. Instead, its two home losses this past weekend tied its loss total in the first 24 home games of the season.</p>\n<p>The home-field advantage the Gauchos used to have seems to have dissipated as they have now lost three of their last four home games.</p>\n<p>As the season nears its end, UCSB has to figure out its issue of poor play soon or its once promising season will end in a disappointing fashion.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium on Tuesday, May 16 at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They have also gutted out some tough victories as three of the last five have been decided by one run, including the game against St. Mary’s, which went 11 innings, their second longest match of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB displayed a solid performance in both sides of the field and was able to pick up its 30th win of the season for the fourth consecutive year. This is only the second time in program history that the team has accomplished this feat, with the last time coming during the 1982-1987 seasons.</p>\n<p>It was a great sight in the first inning of the game to see redshirt junior pitcher James Carter get his first action since coming back from Tommy John surgery last season.</p>\n<p>“I was excited to see him [Carter] back,” Checketts said. “It was good to see him pitch good as well.”</p>\n<p>The right-hander only went one inning, but it sure was a strong one, allowing one hit, no runs and also striking out one of the Waves’ best hitters in junior Manny Jefferson.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous through the first couple of guys, but then I settled in and felt confident after that,” Carter said.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of that inning, the Gauchos started quick, taking an early 1-0 lead as the first three hitters all got singles with the latter batter. Redshirt sophomore left fielder Josh Adams ripped an RBI single thanks to a great hit to left field, scoring redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica and moving sophomore short stop Clay Fisher to second.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Kyle Hatton stepped in after Carter’s solid inning and allowed only one hit in the second and third inning combined. In the fourth, however, Pepperdine tied the game at one thanks to Jefferson’s 11th home run of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would respond in the bottom of the fifth inning, adding two runs and going up 3-1 after freshman Tevin Mitchell scored on an error by the Waves and Fisher’s RBI single down center field and scoring Calica.</p>\n<p>UCSB added to its lead in the next inning after freshman catcher Sam Cohen, in his ninth game of the season, hit an RBI double to right field, scoring teammate Devon Gradford and giving his team the 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Just as the Waves looked like they were done for the night, junior outfielder Matt Gelalich hit an RBI single in the seventh frame that just got by the Gauchos’ first baseman and cut the lead to two runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning with one out, senior first baseman Brad Anderson hit a solo shot home run off of Trevor Bettencourt, who had just replaced Hatton, that again brought Pepperdine close to tying the game, which was now 4-3.</p>\n<p>The Waves would have tied the game, but thankfully the redshirt junior Bettencourt caught junior Aaron Barnett off guard and was able to pick him off at first for the team’s first out. Had that not happened, Anderson’s homer would have been a two-shot and the game could have ended differently.</p>\n<p>Bettencourt was the pitcher who let down his team down in the Gauchos’ only home loss of the season to St. Mary’s after giving up five runs in the eighth frame of that game.</p>\n<p>After the homer and accidently hitting Jefferson and the head putting him on first base, the right-hander did not look afraid of the situation and showed his skills, striking out redshirt sophomore Ben Rodriguez and forcing sophomore Lambert Chase into a fielder’s choice for the final out of the inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did nothing in the bottom of the eighth and relied on its defense to finish off the game. After two easy outs, Pepperdine made the game interesting, ripping off two singles and having runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>Calica, the team’s great center fielder, made an impressive catch by tracking the ball on a hit that looked like it was about to go over his head for the final out, and sealed the 4-3 victory and 17th straight home win.</p>\n<p>Although the win was not the most impressive of the Gauchos’ season, it still was a win nonetheless, and it again displayed the team’s ability to grind tough wins as they are now 11-1 in one-run games.</p>\n<p>Pitching-wise, Hatton was fantastic, picking up his third win of the season after going six innings and allowing five hits and two runs while striking out a career-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>“Kyle Hatton was great with his three pitches,” Checketts said. “He has a sort of invisible fastball. It never breaks 80 [mph], but no one can hit it.”</p>\n<p>In terms of pitcher James Carter, UCSB will continue to monitor him with care and make sure he is progressing steadily as the season heads into crunch time.</p>\n<p>“He will get more pitches each time he’s out there and we will continue to see how he feels,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be throwing next week, and each week my pitch count will go up, and I’m excited about that,” Carter added.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s next series will be against UC Davis at Dobbins Baseball Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

To this point, it has only registered a 6-9-1 record away from home. UCSB’s last series against a conference opponent on the road ended with them surrendering all three games to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>To its credit, however, the Gauchos won their last game on the road, at St. Mary’s, in an 11-inning thriller that ended with a final score of 4-3.</p>\n<p>This season, UC Davis has taken a step back from last year in which it finished 30-26-1. With two or more losses in its final 14 games, it would already have more losses than it did a year ago. However, the Aggies are currently riding their longest winning streak of the season, which is ongoing at four.</p>\n<p>These two teams met a year ago in Santa Barbara with the home team registering the sweep. Still, all three games were close with two of them ending in a one-run victory for the Gauchos. UCSB has not lost a game in Dobbins Stadium since in the Andrew Checketts era and has won the last five series against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>In conference games this season, the Aggies have been in the middle of the pack ranking fifth in on-base percentage (.339), sixth in batting average (.262) and seventh in slugging percentage (.344).</p>\n<p>Big hitters for UC Davis include senior outfielder Cameron Olsen who leads the team with 23 RBI, home runs (3), batting average (.337), on-base percentage (.404) and slugging percentage (.609).</p>\n<p>He is helped by junior Mark Cardinalli who ranks ninth in the conference in batting average with a .327.</p>\n<p>However, one major problem for the Aggies is their earned run average which ranks dead last, ninth, in the conference at 6.99.</p>\n<p>Big time Gaucho hitters will look to take advantage of that mismatch and attack early and often. UCSB is led by sophomore first baseman Austin Bush who leads the team in batting average (.326) and RBI (32) which also ranks 10<sup>th</sup> and fifth in the conference respectively.</p>\n<p>Catcher Dempsey Grover is another top-20 hitter in conference in batting average which is currently at .309. Redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno has also been solid for the team ranking second in hits (42) and tied for first in home runs (4).</p>\n<p>UCSB also has two of the better pitchers in conference with junior Shane Beiber (8-2) and sophomore Kyle Nelson (6-0). Nelson currently holds the best ERA in the conference, 36<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA, with a 1.80 ERA and his 59 strikeouts are 12<sup>th</sup> best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Beiber ranks first in the conference in wins with eight, tying a career high, eighth in the Big West in strikeouts (59) and 13<sup>th</sup> in ERA (3.12).</p>\n<p>This is a big weekend for the Gauchos as they have the opportunity to keep moving up the conference rankings with a series against one of the weaker opponents they will face this season. They also need to prove they can win away from their impenetrable home fortress.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis starting Friday, May 8 at Dobbins Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday’s game are at the same location and both are at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Normally, after winning Saturday’s game, you would expect UCSB to come out firing. However, this was not the case.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat the Gauchos on their Davis home grass 13-3, administering the second worst loss of the season to their opponents and outhitting them 17-6 over the course of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB started strong, taking a 2-0 lead after the top of the second inning thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno earning an RBI single and later scoring a run himself.</p>\n<p>The Aggies roared back in the bottom half of the frame, scoring four runs, two of which came from sophomore Brad Pluschkell’s two-RBI double down the left field line.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless third from both teams, UC Davis went on to score two runs in the fourth, two in the fifth, three in the sixth and two in the seventh to take a commanding 13-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one measly run in the top of the eighth to make it 13-3, but it was not nearly enough to dig themselves out of the huge deficit they faced.</p>\n<p>UC Davis had many big hitters over the course of this game, including freshman Logan Denholm, who went 3-5 (.600) and finished with four RBI, two runs and one big, two-shot home run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Tanner Bily had a perfect hitting day, going 3-3 with two runs scored and an RBI. Sophomores Pluschkell and Justin Allen had an identical night, both going 3-5 (.600) on the day and scoring two runs and batting in two.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kyle Hatton (3-1) had a tough outing for the Gauchos. The left-handed pitcher picked up his first loss of the season after allowing four hits and four runs in 1.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Relieving sophomore pitchers Kyle Nelson and Kenny Chapman did not fare any better, combining to allow 12 hits and nine runs, eight of which were earned runs, in only 4.2 innings.</p>\n<p>Only one UCSB hitter, redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford, registered more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s terrible blowout, Santa Barbara managed to tie the series at one after defeating UC Davis 7-3 in a game that was pushed back two hours past the original start time due to rainy conditions.</p>\n<p>Once the game commenced, the Aggies looked ready to play, taking an early 1-0 lead after freshman Alex Roeser was walked on with the bases loaded, picking up an RBI. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Joe Record forced the next batter into a fielder’s choice to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the teams traded two scoreless innings, the Gauchos went off in the fourth inning, scoring four runs to take a 4-1 lead. Redshirt juniors Ryan Cumberland and Andrew Calica both hit RBI fly outs while freshmen Michael McAdoo and Thomas Rowan hit RBI singles.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added a run in the top of the sixth which UC Davis quickly countered in the bottom half of the frame with a run of its own to make the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>Freshman Caleb van Blake hit a sac fly in the bottom of the eighth inning for UC Davis to cut the lead to 5-3 and give his team some hope down the final stretch.</p>\n<p>However, sophomore Austin Bush put the game away in the top of the ninth inning, blasting a two-run homer to right field and ending the game at 7-3 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The home run by Bush, the team’s first baseman, was his fifth of the season and now is the new team high. It was the sophomore’s only hit of the day, but it was a big one.</p>\n<p>Record (5-4) was able to pick up his fifth win of the season after going six innings and allowing only one earned run while striking out seven batters. Nelson picked up his team-high fifth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Before evening up the series, Santa Barbara struggled to stop UC Davis in the final two innings of the first game, leading to its eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked fine in the first innings, especially in the second when they scored two runs thanks to sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI single and Calica’s RBI walk to take the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the next four innings neither team scored, meaning UCSB kept its 2-0 advantage. Junior pitcher Shane Bieber was great throughout the first six innings, allowing only three hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>It looked as though the pitcher was going to cruise into his career-high and Big West-high ninth victory until the bottom of the seventh, when UC Davis rallied three runs off three hits to take a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were unable to retaliate in the top of the eighth, which meant the Aggies could extend their lead in the bottom half.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettencourt pitched only 0.1 innings but allowed three hits and three more runs to UC Davis, which put them up 6-2 after eighth and it was enough to seal its victory.</p>\n<p>Senior Spencer Henderson played a big role in both those innings, earning his team’s first run of the day after an RBI double which scored Denholm and the team’s last run after an RBI single which also scored Denholm.</p>\n<p>The left-handed pitcher/first baseman went 3-4 (.750) on the day with two RBI and one run scored. Denholm went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos road woes keep plaguing them this season as 11 of the team’s 12 losses have been away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Its road record is now 7-11-1 on the season, the fourth worst in the Big West.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that UCSB is a contender and a tough opponent, but as some point it will need to prove it can win on the road on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Regionals, Super Regionals and College World Series will not be held at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, so in order for this team to be as successful as it wants to be it must be able to go on the road and win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is Tuesday, May 10 against CSU Bakersfield at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
