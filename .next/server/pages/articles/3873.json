The reason: an inappropriate tirade of deafening insults.</p>\n<p>The man – who seemed to have his vocal dial turned up to 11 – told the deputies that he just wanted to go home, all the while trying to dip, duck and dodge the questions thrown his way.</p>\n<p>He managed to count how many shots he’d had that night – eight- but could not seem to remember his alphabet for the officers.</p>\n<p>After several earnest attempts, trying such letter combinations as the commonly mistaken “K-I-Z” and the just barely incorrect “U-P,” he admitted to the officers, “No, I cannot say my ABCs.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending successful completion of his 1-2-3s.</p>\n<p>She’s a Lady<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 1:21 a.m. – After receiving a call from residents on Camino del Sur that a woman was face down on the grass throwing up, an IVFP officer found the19-year-old.</p>\n<p>When the deputy approached the woman, she managed to compose herself enough to speak, and, as the officer noted, was exceedingly polite.</p>\n<p>Despite her good manners, the woman proved a bit untrustworthy. She told the officer that she had gone to a party with her friends, but that like all underage students at UCSB, she only drank water.</p>\n<p>The woman, who had soiled her jeans, repeatedly denied drinking any alcohol. Her story, however, proved about as watertight as a pasta strainer when a test administrated by the deputies showed her blood alcohol content level at .212.</p>\n<p>Once the woman realized she was caught in a lie, she apologized profusely for causing trouble and gracefully faced her night in jail, wet pants and all.</p>\n<p>Close Encounters of the Leafy Kind<br>\nSunday, Jan. 13, 12:52 a.m. – Officers patrolling Sabado Tarde Road saw a woman stumble down the street, lose her balance and run straight into a bush.</p>\n<p>Refusing to let a mere shrub get the best of her, the 19-year-old woman recovered, brushed away the stray twigs from her hair, and continued down the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the deputies, the woman said she was coming from a party on Sueno Road and that all she had to drink was a beer and a shot.</p>\n<p>The officer questioned the validity of her alcohol consumption, and asked the woman if she had any more to drink. She told him, “No, I really did not. I am just a lightweight.”</p>\n<p>When informed of her encounter with the foliage, the woman said she did not remember running into the bush, but reassured the officers that she had talked to many people that night.</p>\n<p>The officers – still on Sabado – asked the woman if she was aware of her surroundings. The woman told the deputies she was on El Nido Lane coming from Cordoba Road – negating both reality and what she had earlier told the officers.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and taken to the IVFP station. While in the interview room, she grew tired and fell asleep beneath the table.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div

Barbara County Board of Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.</p>\n<p>Proposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/","id":3870,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3869,3868,3867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. - An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Truth Will Set You Free-ish.<br>\nSunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. – An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his patrol vehicle and the other subject.</p>\n<p>The 26-year-old woman approached the officer – already busy protecting and serving – and began to spit out incomprehensible slurs.</p>\n<p>The officer put his former engagement on hold momentarily and turned to face the sloshed siren. Quickly, the bloodshot eyes and strong odor of alcohol led the officer to suspect a high level of intoxication. Also, she was not wearing shoes. The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/","id":3871,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3870,3869,3868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Blazing Saddles Mon., May 26, 12:03 a.m. – Deputies in a marked police car came across a truck parked in a fire lane on Seville Road.

Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice.
