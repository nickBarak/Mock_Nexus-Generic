Her bills address various social issues and changes in criminal trial laws.</p>\n<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 55</strong>: This bill proposes to indefinitely extend the Distinguished After School Health (D.A.S.H.) Recognition Program, which ensures that after school programs provide healthy food and drinks for their attendees and include physical activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 169</strong>: Through this bill, Jackson aims to fortify the power of Title IX, a law that students use to protect themselves from sexual discrimination and violence, by making the protections and requirements of Title IX and the role of educational institutions clearer.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 203</strong>: This bill would allow for more development in technology education, including media literacy and internet safety in public schools and would require administrators to review the policies and procedures of these programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 331</strong>: In instances of domestic violence, this bill would add public or private universities and colleges to the definition of “domestic violence victim service organizations,” which would extend the aid that nongovernment organizations receive to support victims of domestic violence</p>\n<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 44</strong>: In response to the damage caused by abandoned oil wells, Jackson hopes this bill would help financially support a coastal hazard and legacy oil and gas wells removal and remediation program.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 212</strong>: This bill aims to extend the definition of “medical waste” to include medical waste generated in households, making such waste applicable to the Medical Waste Management Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 224</strong>: This bill would prevent the lead agencies of the California Environmental Quality Act from directly establishing the conditions of a project that may harm the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 290</strong>: With the acquisition of funds, this bill would help establish rehabilitation centers for injured marine animals and would allow the Department of Fish and Wildlife to work with nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 465:</strong> This bill aims to make changes to how the supervisors of abandoned oil wells report their findings.</p>\n<p><strong>EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 62:</strong> Under current law, an employee is able to take up to 12 weeks off to bond with their child, take care for a sick child, parent or spouse and take time off if they are suffering from a serious health issue. This bill would broaden the definition an employee’s “child,” erase the age restriction and would allow the employee to take time off to take care of an ill grandparent, grandchild, sibling, domestic partner and a parent-in-law.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 63:</strong> This bill would make it illegal for employers to prohibit an employee from receiving a 12-week parental leave with health benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 327</strong>: This bill proposes to make changes to the way a business removes customers’ personal information to protect their privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SR 9</strong>: This bill aims to ensure that Planned Parenthood in California retains its current funding and continues to support women’s rights and health care.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 309:</strong> This bill would allow the State Department of Health Care Services to sponsor a license plate design that shows support of pro-choice reproductive rights. The proceeds made from these license plates would go to the California Reproductive Freedom Fund to support the Family Planning, Access, Care and Treatment program.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGES IN CRIMINAL TRIAL</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 670</strong>: In the case where a person has more than one felony in different counties, this bill aims to clarify that the judicial council must decide in which county the felon should have his or her trial.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 725</strong>: This bill proposes to extend the definition of a misdemeanor to include DUIs so that people with a DUI misdemeanor can be placed in a pretrial diversion program to receive treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>LEGISLATIVE ADJUSTMENTS</strong><br>\n<strong>Measure SB 347</strong>: This bill aims to make various changes to the way remote controlled aircrafts, most commonly known as drones, are used, including adding liability insurance to people operating the remote piloted aircraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 188</strong>: The Emergency Management Assistance Compact allows states to help each other out in instances of emergencies and disasters. This bill would extend the use of this law until 2023.<br>\nMeasure SB 36: This bill would maintain the $315 fee that active lawyers pay to the State Bar of California for membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 387:</strong> Under this bill, the fines imposed by the False Claims Act would be adjusted with the levels of inflation so the money collected would remain effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure SB 690</strong>: This bill would allow for the applicant‘s information received by the State Bar of California to be public, including their names.</p>\n<p><em>A

SpaceX Communications Director John Taylor said he couldn’t disclose the SpaceX CEO and founder’s location. He said, however, that either Musk or SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell are always on site in the launch control center.</span></p>\n<p>Whether on location or not, Musk was certainly monitoring the start of the program which SpaceX first embarked on eight years ago, evident by his Twitter feed throughout the launch procedures.</p>\n<p>At 11:05 a.m. he posted “Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship,” and later retweeted a photo of the Falcon 9 rocket safely docked on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship stationed in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"74838\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-15/spacex-launch-commences-groundbreaking-satellite-program-after-eight-years-in-development/spacex/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"587,396\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"spacex\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74838\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=587%2C396\" alt=\"Twitter.com\" width=\"587\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?w=587&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>The satellites were delivered into a “temporary parking orbit” at 625 km to be tested by Iridium in the weeks to come.

bill “Statue of Liberty Values Act,” which aims to block federal funding for President Trump’s seven-nation immigration ban. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal has co-sponsored a bill that would defund President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, adding his name to a list of California legislators taking action against the executive order.</p>\n<p>Trump announced his travel ban last Friday, halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the intake of refugees from Syria.</p>\n<p>Carbajal, who represents California’s 24th District, is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren titled “Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) Act,” which would eradicate and block all federal funding for Trump’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Our country’s safety and national security is paramount,” Carbajal stated in a press release on Monday. “President Trump’s overly broad executive order only serves to fuel anti-American sentiment and propaganda, putting our national security at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Carbajal believes the executive order “demonstrates dangerous and irresponsible leadership” because it “developed hastily” and was not thoroughly discussed with national security agencies.</p>\n<p>Tess Whittlesey, communications director for Congressman Carbajal, said the Senate majority is refusing to bring the bill to the floor for consideration because Republicans, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, are in favor of the president’s order.</p>\n<p>However, Whittlesey said it is “important to be a strong advocate” for immigrant communities, even if the bill does not move forward.</p>\n<p>“He’s here fighting for Central Coast values no matter what the odds are of legislation getting picked up,” Whittlesey said. “It’s what he believes in, and he’s going to keep fighting for those values here in Washington.”</p>\n<p>Austin Hechler, Associated Students (A.S.) president and fourth-year political science major, said Carbajal’s actions demonstrate how California is “extremely diverse and inclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, chair of the California Senate Judiciary Committee, said she admires Carbajal’s sponsorship of the bill and his condemnation of Trump’s “outrageous behavior.”</p>\n<p>“Our system of government has checks and balances, and I think it’s critically important that the Congress, which is one of those checks and balances, does, in fact, do its job,” Jackson said. “I appreciate Congressman Carbajal … and I believe every congressmember willing to follow the Constitution and their oath of office should be doing the same.”</p>\n<p>The California Senate Judiciary Committee passed Senate Resolution 16 on Monday, which condemns Trump’s ban as a “discriminatory overreach” and urges the president to revoke the executive order. The resolution also asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow immigrant detainees access to legal counsel “as quickly as feasible.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the committee met Tuesday to discuss three bills that would provide legal assistance for immigrants facing deportation, outlaw local law enforcement from investigating someone based on immigration status and prohibit state agencies from disclosing a person’s religious affiliation to the federal government.</p>\n<p>Jackson said constituents have expressed concern to her about their safety, as some have been “terrorized by people who have been emboldened by [Trump’s] intolerance.”</p>\n<p>“The best way to deal with this would be to educate people,” Jackson said. “I don’t think that people are inherently unkind to each other. We need to teach and talk with each other and recognize the importance of kindness and compassion.”</p>\n<p>According to Whittlesey, the state Senate’s work to limit the power of the executive order in California, along with Carbajal’s support in Congress, foreshadows how California will respond in the future to contentious presidential orders.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to see California reacting to a lot of Trump’s policies going forward,” Whittlesey said. “We’re definitely going to be a face of resistance during the administration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.

access to inmates’ personal information in the jail computers and databases, such as immigration status.</p>\n<p>While the Lobby Corps began the project last December, the Central Coast Immigration Rights Coalition (CCIRC) has been discussing I.C.E. with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) for the past three years. Bill Brown is the current Sheriff.</p>\n<p>In addition to the UCSB Lobby Corps, Santa Barbara City College, Allan Hancock College and Westmont College have been assisting CCIRC.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, I.C.E. enforces immigration laws in the county and has a workspace in the county jail with access to inmates’ information.</p>\n<p>Jails, separate from prisons, are holding facilities used to confine people serving sentences for misdemeanors, awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges or confined for civil matters.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. and jails work under the Truth Act, statewide legislation that creates more transparency in interactions between SBSO, I.C.E. and inmates.</p>\n<p>The Truth Act ensures that people in jail are aware of their rights to due process, legal counsel and that records relating to I.C.E. access must be open to the public.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if local law enforcement chooses to notify I.C.E. about an inmate’s release, the person and their attorney or designee must be notified of their release date and time as well.</p>\n<p>While organizations like CCIRC and Lobby Corps hope for an increase in strict enforcement of the Truth Act, they are lobbying to completely remove I.C.E. from prisons.</p>\n<p>Daniel Torres, a second-year history of public policy major and an organizer for Lobby Corps, said SBSO has been open about its “working relationship” with I.C.E., but said the Lobby Corps wants to “sever that connection” between the local jails and I.C.E.</p>\n<p>According to Frank Rodriguez, organizer of the Santa Barbara California Immigrant Policy Center which operates CCIRC, the county supervisors provide the funds and resources to the county jails.</p>\n<p>If CCIRC and the Lobby Corps can convince SBSO to limit I.C.E.’s work in the jails, county supervisors would then have the ability to restrict I.C.E.’s access to the jail’s computers and databases.</p>\n<p>Torres said the Lobby Corps and other organizations plan to work with Santa Barbara County Supervisors, and has already met with Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino to discuss the project.</p>\n<p>Lavagnino said, however, that although he disagrees with some immigration decisions made by the federal government, he believes immigration agents have an important role in county jails.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody would agree that those that come to this country and have committed serious felonies, I thought everybody would approve of them being returned to their country,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Torres and Rodriguez, if the lobbying efforts are effective, the group could be discussing the next steps of the project with supervisors by March or April.</p>\n<p>Torres said it is important to work with the county supervisors and SBSO to “make sure undocumented stories are heard … and taken into account.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
