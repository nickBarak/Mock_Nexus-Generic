The case alleges that Shehadeh owes Icon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ikes-lawsuit.pdf\">more than $42,000 in overdue rent</a>, according to public records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reached out to both Icon’s leasing office and its legal team several times, but did not receive any comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a separate interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shehadeh said he recently filed a countersuit against Icon, alleging that “[Icon] did some things that we didn’t appreciate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh’s countersuit alleges that Icon breached his lease agreement and committed fraud in the form of concealment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a court document sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Shehadeh’s attorney, the countersuit alleges that Icon hid important information following a situation involving mold on the premises, resulting in the eventual litigation currently taking place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After informing Icon in January of 2018 that he would no longer be leasing the store, “Icon negotiated with Ike’s Place to amend the lease” and remain in I.V., according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that following the repair of a faulty hose in the soda dispenser at the I.V. location, Icon, “unbeknownst to Ike’s Place… hired ATC Group Services LLC to perform a mold inspection in the neighboring property…” that same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that same week, ATC Group Services allegedly reported that the mold found on the premises was coming from Shehadeh’s store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report claimed that the faulty hose was to blame for the mold but, allegedly, nobody from ATC Group Services contacted the store to inform Shehadeh there was a presence of mold on the premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the court document alleges that Icon had knowledge of mold on the premises prior to the faulty hose in the I.V. location’s soda dispenser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soda dispensary machine at the I.V. location had allegedly been inspected just “weeks prior” and the health inspector “did not find any issues with that machine,” according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Shehadeh entered negotiations between Jan. 19 of 2018 and Jul. 4 of 2018 to extend his lease with Icon, the leasing agency allegedly “did not disclose this mold report to Ike’s Place,” according to the court document: “had Ike’s Place known that Icon intended to blame mold damages in the Premises upon Ike’s place, then Ike’s Place would have been able to obtain contemporaneous evidence that it was not responsible for said damages.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh eventually decided to terminate his lease with Icon during the negotiation period but received an email in which Icon offered to “modify the amendment for the reduced gross rent,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within weeks, Shehadeh agreed to extend the lease, ending negotiations with Icon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegedly, “almost immediately” after Shehadeh signed the extended lease, Icon began inspections to “establish the presence of mold that it was already aware existed but had not disclosed to Ike’s Place,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that “Intrusive remedial work” was performed on the I.V. store following the inspection, ceasing store operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, biohazard signs were scattered throughout the store, bathrooms were closed, the kitchen was sealed off and the I.V. location was unable to make and serve sandwiches, according to the court document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ike’s place was unable to continue to do business at the level it previously did and was accordingly unable to pay rent,” the court document states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leaving the I.V. store uninformed about the mold, the court document alleges, Icon breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it concealed material facts from Ike’s place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. store claims, in the court document, that it was “harmed” by Icon due to its reliance on false information the leasing agency provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Icon’s suppression of material facts was malicious and egregious such that Icon should be liable for punitive damages,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document adds that the I.V. location is seeking compensation for “punitive damages,” the cost of the suit, attorney’s fees and “general, special, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or economic damages…”</span></p>\n<p><b>New State Street Store:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new shop slated to open next week, Shehadeh circumvented the short hiring window by offering all current employees at the I.V location a chance to work at the new store. Furthermore, the store will be managed by one of Ike’s first-ever managers, who will bring roughly 10 years of experience to the new sandwich parlor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Street location is equipped with a parking lot, which allows for a full-size catering menu, decreased wait times for delivery and parking for both employees and customers, according to Shehadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Shehadeh also plans to keep the lights on late into the night, flirting with new store hours such as “10 to 10” on weekdays and “10 to midnight” on weekends. However, the hours will be adjusted according to demand, as Shehadeh finds that there’s no use in staying open if nobody wants to purchase food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further compensate for the move, Shehadeh is excited to offer a “super student discount,” where both Santa Barbara City College and UC Santa Barbara students can tack on chips and a drink to their meal for “a buck fifty.”</span></p>\n<p>The court filings in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

General Manager Troy Yamasaki, the new shop, located at 416 E Haley St., is revolutionary in its progressive steps toward reducing waste.</p>\n<p>“We are unique in that we don’t have any single-use to-go cups or single-use to-go anything,” Yamasaki said. “At Cajé in I.V. we understand that students are busy and have to run, but we do have a lot of consumer waste there.”</p>\n<p>“With us having the opportunity to open a shop with an entirely new concept, we thought that we should take a step in the right direction for the environment and cut down on our use of single-use plastic cups,” he added.</p>\n<p>The downtown Cajé relies on what is known as an “exchange program” as an alternative to single-use cups. Customers pay a deposit to use a reusable cup, which is repaid when the cup is returned.</p>\n<p>“We have an exchange program, so it is $5 for a hot cup and $2 for a Mason jar, and you pay that deposit and you get your order in a reusable cup,” Yamasaki said. “If you give it back to us, we give you [the deposit] back.”</p>\n<p>In contrast to the I.V. location, the downtown location will be a Prohibition-era themed bar beginning at 5 p.m. The bar, called Lab Social, is a speakeasy-style bar, meaning that it is hidden from public view.</p>\n<p>“[The bar] is supposed to be slightly incognito,” Yamasaki said. “It is a trend that a lot of bigger cities are doing, where instead of just being a bar with the front door open, it’s a bar that is kind of hidden within another store or hidden from plain sight.”</p>\n<p>The front door will be locked at nights, and customers will have to find their way into the bar through the back entrance, according to Yamasaki.</p>\n<p>Other differences between the I.V. location and the new Cajé downtown revolve around the menu.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, we have bagels, acai bowls and smoothies,” Yamasaki said. “[Downtown], our menu right now is consisting of a tortilla española and an avocado toast, which is different than the location in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the downtown Cajé has formed a collaboration with Sama Sama Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant, to diversify Cajé’s menu. According to Yamasaki, the menu is expected to grow, with the full version to be rolled out come grand opening, pending a time and date to be determined.</p>\n<p>“The space is beautiful, and we are really excited to provide a downtown haven for our regulars in Cajé Isla Vista as well,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate all the love and support we have received so far. It’s actually been ridiculous how many regulars from our current location came out to show some love and some support. There is just a lot of gratitude here for that loyalty.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

apartment building. </span><em>Courtesy of I.V. CSD</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BigSpeak CEO Jonathan Wygant and Anacapa Development owner Terry Huggins are interested in redeveloping the area to increase the amount of affordable housing in I.V. as well as to create more startup/incubator spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant, whose family owns Embarcadero Hall and has a financial agreement with UC Santa Barbara that ends in 2026, said he and his siblings felt that the building could be better utilized than as just a lecture hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wygant and Huggins were both familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/successor-agency/isla-vista-master-plan.sbc\">Isla Vista Master Plan</a>, “a planning document for the Isla Vista area which sets forth community goals and policies to guide the future growth of Isla Vista,” and felt there was an opportunity to further develop the community, starting with the Loop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After surveying the area, the two said they wanted to create “something that could serve the community at a higher level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed renovations involve turning the Embarcadero Hall lot into an apartment building. The two would then renovate the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naan Stop, Dumpling King, Deja Vu and Rosarito </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to a multi-story building with a lecture hall, restaurants, co-working offices and startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building where the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) currently holds its meetings, 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, would become another multi-use building, housing a new I.V. Community Center and the I.V. CSD offices on the bottom floor and apartments on the upper floors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final building that Wygant and Huggins want to renovate is the current I.V. Community Center building, which is already under renovation by the I.V. CSD. Wygant and Huggins would relocate the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic to the first floor of this building, and then fill the rest of the bottom floor with restaurants. The upper floors would be more startup/incubator offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think that with everything that’s going on, particularly in the hard sciences out of UCSB, it could be a great place to start a business in collaboration with one of the departments or several of the departments over at UCSB,” Huggins said. “And there really isn’t anything like that in Isla Vista right now. But we’d like to provide it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins added that the new spaces would incentivize recently graduated students to stay in I.V. because of the businesses as well, although Board Director Jay Freeman questioned whether the two had actually done research on the demand for tech companies in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two envision all of the buildings to be four stories tall, but said none of them would exceed 45 feet in height. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between the three buildings located on the Embarcadero Del Mar side of the Loop, Huggins envisions a considerable amount of patio space, where students can “sit outside and have a cup of coffee.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant don’t currently own the strip of restaurants on Embarcadero Del Mar, Huggins said he was “working on something.” Since the proposal is still in very early stages, Huggins said he didn’t want to take action on possibly purchasing other buildings in the Loop just yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not trying to replace the established places that people like to go in Isla Vista to eat or drink. We just want to redevelop this in a way that adds to the community rather than takes away from other people’s businesses,” Huggins added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two also believe that retail around this area would be “really revitalize[d]” by the renovations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Huggins and Wygant stressed the community benefits of the renovations, the proposal met backlash from the packed room, with several long-term residents and community members expressing concern about the potential loss of public spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone’s gotta say something you guys,” Pegeen Soutar, vice chairperson of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and a resident of I.V. for 35 years, said, kicking off public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spent some time with both these gentlemen and I’ve tried to go into things with an open mind and my concern is always for the community, but I have concerns about even this variation of the plan,” Soutar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a community center finally; after many, many years, it’s going to be open in August. We’ve been waiting 40 years for this and I think it’s going to be beautiful…I think it’s going to be what we need and it’s a great start for us. If somewhere in the future we decide we need more space, when we’ve proven that we’ve burst out of the doors of that one, then I think that’s something that we as a community can discuss,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, I’m not, right now, seeing a benefit to the community to put things on hold or to change things that already exist right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar also pointed out the lack of parking allocation in the plan or any research on the environmental impact of having more people frequenting the Loop. Soutar said she respected the two for reaching out and asking the community for feedback, but said “at this point, I’m so excited for what we have already.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen echoed Soutar’s comments, pointing out that having that many UCSB students on that side of the Loop would cause a slew of traffic problems for cars, bikers and pedestrians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another community member stood up, pointed at the proposal sketch and dryly said, “Welcome to Los Angeles, eventually.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once public comment was over, the I.V. CSD returned to its discussion and questioning. All the board members expressed concern with I.V. losing the public spaces that it very recently created for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSD Director Father Jon-Stephen Hedges said he was uncomfortable with the idea of people coming in from the outside and changing the landscape of I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a process of questions, and questions are important. But there is also a visceral reaction that I’m sure some of us in this room have which is somehow beyond those questions,” Hedges said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At least three of us remaining on the board sit here because… one of our taglines was ‘nothing for us without us.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Visioning is something best done by those who will live out that vision rather than those who have good ideas from the outside. That’s not to say that good ideas can’t come from outside,” Hedges said. “But I’m not ready for this, I’m really not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins and Wygant plan to take all the feedback they received into consideration before deciding how they want to proceed. They both anticipate being present at future I.V. CSD meetings and will continue speaking with community members about how to make their proposed renovations more community-friendly.</span></p>\n<div class=\"_3_bl\">\n<div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\">\n<div class=\"_4gx_\">\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"_1aa6\"><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
