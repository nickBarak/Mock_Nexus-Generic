\r\n</script> \n<p>At the 10-minute mark, halfway through the first half, the score was low, Gauchos leading 15-13. No. 8 UCSB was putting up a formidable fight against No. 4 CSUN. The two teams crawled up the board basket by basket as both forced turnovers and tried to profit from them.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman center Tyler Jackson entered the game at 9:56 in his second-ever court appearance. Within 50 seconds he made a sweet steal, an offensive rebound, and 2-2 foul shots. With UCSB’s usual big players still out, Jackson has had large shoes to fill on the court.</p>\n<p>At 8:38 CSUN redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson made a steal and had a fast break down the court, but he was no match for UCSB senior guard Eric Childress, who took the ball right out of Johnson’s hands, turned around and made a layup, sending Gaucho fans to their feet.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, one of CSUN’s most valued players — redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith — was not making as many moves as expected. Averaging 16.5 points per game in the regular season, he only scored one basket the entire first half.</p>\n<p>On the other half of the court, team leader junior guard Gabe Vincent was on fire, going 4-6 in three-pointers. Dominating the court on defense as well as offense, he managed to put 16 on the board before the half ended and was able to tap into energy the Gauchos so desperately needed.</p>\n<p>This was a historic night for Vincent as well as UCSB basketball. With 4:11 left in the first half, Vincent made his 183rd career three-pointer, passing Gaucho legend Orlando Johnson and becoming number nine on the UCSB all-time top 10 list of three-pointers made. He went on to finish the game with a total of 185 completed threes.</p>\n<p>As the half went on the Gauchos seemed as though they knew what they wanted to do, but just could not get the shot off. Lots of time was spent handing off around the three-point line with few drives, but UCSB held its ground.</p>\n<p>After such an evenly matched half, the last two minutes were startling as the Matadors found their stride. Scoring seven points in one minute, the Matadors flipped a switch and were able to run all over the Gauchos without resistance.</p>\n<p>Aside from two more three-pointers made by Vincent, the Matadors increased their score by 13 points in just over three minutes, leaving a shocking halftime score of 36-32.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the first half, CSUN came out of the gates guns blazing as the second period started. For every shot a Gaucho took, the Matadors took two. All players were playing with heart, but the Matadors were simply moving faster and shooting more accurately.</p>\n<p>With Childress and Vincent missing shot after shot, it was clear the Gauchos had lost their groove and were struggling to pick their heads up. After Vincent’s brilliant first-half performance, going 0-7 in field goals made for a disappointing second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman guard Max Heidegger was a firecracker with impressive ball handling, hard drives and risky but successful shots. He especially shone in the second half when Childress and Vincent seemed burned out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Starting around the 13th minute with a three-pointer from junior guard Michael Warren, the Matadors were able to keep a steady 10-or-more-point lead for the rest of the game. Based on of the level of competition in this first half, this surge from CSUN surprised and devastated Gaucho fans.</p>\n<p>As the second half dragged on and players on both sides of the court continued to get more and more frustrated, the roughness of play also increased. Although CSUN players were on the floor multiple times in the first half, many Gauchos joined them in the second half. They finished the game with 17 Matador fouls and 20 Gaucho fouls.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, both Lubin and Smith dunked in the last five minutes of the game, only furthering the frustration of the home team. Lately the Gauchos have not been able to keep up the energy and precision of play as games wind to an end, a flaw that was unfortunately on display in this most recent game.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Although it was another conference loss piling onto the disappointment of losing at home, the first half of the UCSB-CSUN game gave Gaucho fans hope. The men’s team will have the opportunity to win their first game away when they challenge No. 7 University of Hawaii.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/ucsb-loses-big-at-home-versus-csun/","id":283,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[282,281,280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander","biography":"Not available","articles":[248,281,283,301,304,307,310,467,470,472,493,514,1919,3330],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Stumbles in Texas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s tennis team’s seven-match road trip did not end well in Texas this weekend, as the Gauchos lost to UT Arlington on Saturday and again to #61 SMU on Sunday.

It was really hard for both players on the court.”</p>\n<p>UCSB tried switching up its doubles pairs at courts two and three to no avail, and has dropped the doubles point in each of the last four matches.  Head Coach Marty Davis paired Forget with senior Phillip Therp on court two and sophomore Benjamin Recknagel with senior Evan Jurgensen at court three, but the changes could not prevent the Gauchos from going 0-4 in those slots over the weekend. The unchanged pair of seniors Taylor Chavez-Goggin and Alex Konigsfeldt at court one have been a bright spot throughout the season, and the two continued to prove that this weekend by winning both of their matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos traveled to Dallas on Sunday for the match against SMU, and after dropping the doubles point once again, UCSB took the singles matches at courts one, two and six. The highlight was Recknagel, who  overcame a 5-1 deficit in a third-set tiebreaker after suffering a case of nausea from the heat to win the tiebreak 8-6 and take the point.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to doubles,” Forget said. “We are going to try and figure it out. If we can get that doubles point, everything will be so much easier. We just need to work on it. It’s tough when you get that many losses in a row.”</p>\n<p>UCSB wraps up its Big West season at home against Cal Poly next Saturday in a Blue-Green Rivalry match and follows that with a nonconference home game against Loyola Marymount on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/ucsb-stumbles-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/ucsb-stumbles-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/ucsb-stumbles-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/ucsb-stumbles-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/ucsb-stumbles-texas/","id":280,"author":{"id":294,"name":"Kyle Detz"},"related":[279,278,277],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host CSUN In Crucial Big West Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With only one win in the conference season thus far, the UCSB men's basketball team will look to pick up a home win versus CSUN and move up the conference ladder.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team will host Cal State Northridge this Wednesday in the hopes of turning around its two-game losing streak along with the hope of ascending within the conference standings.</p>\n<p>At 3-14 overall and 1-4 in conference, the Gauchos are in desperate need of a win, while the Matadors stand at 7-12, 3-3 and are hoping to end their three-game losing slump.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68785\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68785\" data-attachment-id=\"68785\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/gabe-vincent-shuffles-toward-the-hoop-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent shuffles toward the hoop.

But judging by the current conference standings, CSUN’s team is going to be a tougher challenge.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, senior guard Kendall Smith is the conference’s leading scorer, averaging 19 points per game. Overall, he ranks second with a 16.5 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Following closely behind his fellow starter in PPG average is junior forward Tavrion Dawson at 14.1 per contest. The 6’8” power player scored 14 points on UCSB last year and is currently the top rebounder on the team, averaging 5.8 boards per game and grabbed a career-high of 14 boards against the University of Bethesda this season.</p>\n<p>A well-rounded player from the CSUN bench to watch for is redshirt sophomore forward Rakim Lubin. He averages 5.5 rebounds per game, just behind Dawson’s 5.8 average, and has a field goal percentage of .533. In each of his last two games he has fouled out after getting the maximum five fouls, but he has still managed to score 13 of the 29 bench points against the number one team in the Big West, UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The Matadors will not be an easy matchup for the Gauchos, especially since the CSUN field goal and three point field goal percentages are both respectively over nine percent better than those of UCSB. Finishing plays to completion has been one problem for the Gauchos this year that has yet to be fully resolved.</p>\n<p>Although junior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju remain unable to play, it seems that the Gauchos have found a solid starting line-up.</p>\n<p>In their most recent game, junior guard Gabe Vincent was able to score 18 points alongside junior forward Alex Hart’s 10; unfortunately, the Gauchos’ shooting ability was no match for UC Riverside’s starting lineup. With four out of five starters scoring in double figures, UCSB could not keep up.</p>\n<p>Alongside Vincent and Hart, senior guard Eric Childress, sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak and freshman guard Clifton Powell have started off the last four games and have been able to effectively keep opposing teams’ scores low.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore center Tyler Jackson has made his first appearance in a UCSB game this past weekend. Jackson redshirted his first year and has been unable to play this season due to an injury, but he definitely made waves in his 11 minutes of playing time on Saturday. Standing at 7’2”, his height is necessary under the basket since two Gaucho bigs are not currently able to play.</p>\n<p>Although it may seem late in the season, the Gauchos are slowly finding their rhythm. In their most recent game every player — starting and from the bench — put points on the board except for one. A younger team with a new playing style is no easy feat for Head Coach Bob Williams, and the team’s skills will be put to the test again as they face the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge in a conference match at 7 p.m. tonight, Jan. 25, at the Thunderdome.

\r\n</script> \n<p>CSUN, currently tied with UC Irvine for seventh, is hoping to end its four game skid. Sitting at 8-11 and 1-4 in conference play, the Matadors’ matchup versus UCSB will be the second of their four game home stand.</p>\n<p>There is a current total of three Gauchos that average 10 points per game. One of them is redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman, who serves as the team’s focal point in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>Leading the Big West in field goal percentage with a 57.6 overall average, and has been even more efficient during UCSB’s conference schedule, making a huge improvement to 65.1 percent. Helping create high percentage shots has been her ability to rebound the ball as well. During conference play, she is tied for third in rebounds per game at 8.4.</p>\n<p>Edelman has increased her endurance to be able to produce when called upon, ranking second in minutes per game with a 37.4 average during the conference slate.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s post player is coming off her highest point total in a conference game thus far of 19 points. Over the course of both the non-conference and conference schedules combined, Edelman leads the team in games with at least 10 points at 11.</p>\n<p>It can be expected that Edelman will face one of her toughest matchups in the paint this Wednesday as she will battle it out with sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>After an exceptional freshman season, in which she was named the Big West Freshman of the Year and became the first rookie to be a First Team All-Big West selection since 2002, Fluker remains within the top ranks of post players in the conference.</p>\n<p>Averaging 15.2 points and 10 rebounds per game, Fluker is currently the only player in the Big West to average a double-double in any statistical category. Her rebounds per game average ranks 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation. Her 206 total rebounds is the most in league play so far this season and has helped the Matadors gain their conference leading average of 42.6 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>She is a proven rim protector, owning a conference leading 2.2 blocks per game average. Her current total of 42 blocks, which leads all Big West players, has already surpassed her total of 35 in her first year.</p>\n<p>Although CSUN was swept in both of its games against the Gauchos last season, Fluker made her presence felt in game two of the series with a 31-point performance.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the Matadors’ gameplan revolves around Fluker, so the Gauchos will look to contain her presence in the interior, but still must remain aware of the three-point shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. Maulupe’s 40.5 three-point percentage ranks sixth in the Big West, while 47 three-point makes is second.</p>\n<p>Thus far, UCSB has been consistent with its perimeter defense, ranking third overall in three-point defense at 28.7 percent. They also are second in scoring defense, allowing 63.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal State Northridge will face each this Wednesday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75192\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75192\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/ucsb-carries-momentum-on-the-road-at-csun/","id":282,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[281,280,279],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
