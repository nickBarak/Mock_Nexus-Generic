It shows that through hard work and perseverance, dreams can come true.”</p>\n<p>Johnson was the only player selected from California and one of five guards. From UCSB, Johnson is just the fourth Gaucho to play for Team USA and the first since Kristen Mann and Lindsay Taylor in 2003.</p>\n<p>Last season, Johnson led the Gauchos in points, assists, three-pointers, field goals, and was tied for the team lead in steals. A member of the All Big West First Team, she averaged 13.7 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>The Loomis, CA native was first informed of her chance to compete for our country in August. The criteria for making the team was based on several factors, including her college career, academics and work ethic.</p>\n<p>“For her to have the opportunity is an honor for the fact that hard work was acknowledged and that’s what Emilie brings,” UCSB women’s basketball Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “She [paid] her dues and worked hard enough that she [deserved] to be one of those athletes.”</p>\n<p>On Oct. 15, Johnson began training with her teammates in Houston. Three days later, the team flew to Mexico, where they practiced until they played their opening game on the 21st. From there, the squad played four games in four days.</p>\n<p>“That first time you put on that USA jersey is just so amazing in itself and I just wanted to play hard and give it my all,” Johnson said. “I’m humbled by the opportunity to wear USA.”</p>\n<p>The hard work paid off once again for the senior, as Johnson started every game in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“It was an honor to start,” Johnson said. “It was an honor to have that role of [leading] my team, [setting] my teammates up and [getting] the ball inside to our posts.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-31.jpg?resize=138%2C259\" alt=\"\" width=\"138\" height=\"259\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">In their first matchup against Argentina, USA took a tough 58-55 loss in which the Americans failed to execute down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“It was just experience,” Johnson said. “Argentina has a national team, so we were playing 30-year-old women and we’re college athletes.”</p>\n<p>The next day, USA found itself stuck with a similar result, losing 75-70, which eliminated them from the medal rounds. Johnson had a solid effort, shooting 3-5 for seven points. She also tallied three steals.</p>\n<p>“It’s just about finding your role on the team and everyone was still trying to find that role,” Johnson said. “As a point guard, I’m just trying to distribute. It’s about the team and our country.”</p>\n<p>Finally things clicked against Mexico as USA dominated 87-58, leading by as many as 32 points at one time. Johnson continued in stride from the previous match, pouring in 10 points on 4-6 shooting, to go with five rebounds, three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>“The Mexico game was a highlight,” Johnson said. “It took a while for us to gel but we did by that game and really took off from there. I think if we’d had three more days of practice, we would’ve come together before and capitalized on Argentina and Puerto Rico.”</p>\n<p>Playing for seventh place in the final game of the tournament, USA obliterated Jamaica 87-41. Trailing 9-6 in the first quarter, Johnson drained a three that sparked an 18-2 run. Johnson also tallied three assists and five rebounds in the game.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve liked to have done better because going to the medal rounds was definitely one of our goals,” Johnson said. “The expectation for the United States is to always be in the medal rounds, so that was a little frustrating and disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Johnson averaged five points, 1.75 assists, 3.8 rebounds, two steals and 23 minutes per game. Her biggest contribution was her defense, tying her for the team lead in total steals with eight.</p>\n<p>“She plays hard all the time,” Mitchell said. “She does a good job of help when the ball goes into the post. She’s a high basketball IQ player.”</p>\n<p>While USA returns home with no shiny hardware around their neck to brag about, Johnson summed up the experience as nothing less than a dream.</p>\n<p>“It was the opportunity to play for something bigger than the game,” Johnson said, who also called being excited an understatement. “You’re playing for your country. [I was] playing for my friends, my family, my teammates, my town back home and this university.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest surprises for Johnson was the difference in the international game, especially the physicality. Johnson returned home with plenty of battle wounds to show off. Also unexpected for Johnson was the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“Something I wasn’t aware of was how intense and emotional the fans were,” Johnson said. “It really was a sixth man there and most were cheering against the United States, so it made it even more of a rowdy crowd, but I loved it.”</p>\n<p>Johnson’s dream of playing USA basketball is rooted back to the Olympics. On her official UCSB bio, she lists Team USA’s women’s basketball team as her favorite sports team.</p>\n<p>“I’d be up at whatever time the game was [on],” Johnson said. “I think you see another side of a player come out when they’re wearing that uniform.”</p>\n<p>After missing 10 days with her school team, Johnson is back in Santa Barbara, practicing and playing catch-up as their season rapidly approaches. With a new head coach, the team — and its starting point guard — is still adjusting to the new system.</p>\n<p>“I learned a ton during this experience with USA basketball, so I’m just trying to be a presence to my team and help in any way I can,” Johnson said. “I’m so thankful to Coach Mitch for giving me this opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first official game of the season is set for Nov. 11.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take it slow with her,” Mitchell said. “We don’t expect her to figure it out overnight and we’re still looking at Nov. 11 as what really counts. She’s just getting a feel for what her role’s going to be here.”</p>\n<p>As the team’s starting point guard and team captain, it will probably be a big one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42509\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/red-white-blue-gold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42509\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/red-white-blue-gold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/red-white-blue-gold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/red-white-blue-gold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/red-white-blue-gold/","id":840,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[839,838,837],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Suffer First Conf.

While the Gauchos also went 1-6 from beyond the arc in the first, Drew Edelman went to work in the paint, scoring 9 of her team-high 18 points in the decently-even quarter. Morgan Green got to the line with 11 seconds left to knock down two free throws to put Irvine behind 17-18 heading into the second.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the second, Drew Toler scored 7 of her 9 points as Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to just 14 points. The Gauchos went on a scoring drought that last over three minutes, but threes by Tal Sahar and Toler towards the end of the first half extended their lead to 37-31.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In the third, it was Irvine making the push, as the Anteaters held Santa Barbara to 14 points and closed out the quarter on an 8-0 run thanks to Morgan Green and Lauren Saiki.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Green and Saiki each scored 8 points in the third. Green finished the night with a game-high 25 points and 6 rebounds. The run by the Anteaters gave Irvine a 53-51 lead going into the final 10 minutes of play.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">In a high-scoring fourth quarter, Irvine outscored the Gauchos 24-23 to complete the comeback effort. Although UCSB closed out the game with their last 12 points coming from three pointers, the Anteaters managed to make all 8 of their free throws in the fourth to keep in front of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yazzy Sa’Dullah knocked down two from the line with 18 seconds left to put the Anteaters up 6. Sarah Porter managed to hit a three with 2 seconds remaining as part of her 8-point quarter, but it was too late for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Losing only by 3 points, Santa Barbara has to be disappointed, but the continual growth of the Gauchos this season is perhaps a silver lining head coach Bonnie Henrickson can find in this game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos matched the Anteaters in many aspects and even held the advantage in the paint as well as in terms of bench production. UCSB outscored Irvine 28-22 down low and got 26 points from its bench, but the difference in the game seemed to be free-throws. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the Anteaters managed to go 18 for 23 from the charity stripe, the Gauchos only made 8 of their 15 free throws. Santa Barbara with its 23 personal fouls committed marks a season-high for the Gauchos.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite giving Irvine 18 points from free-throws, UCSB’s offense has now scored 70 points or higher in 5 of its last 6 games. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Drew Edelman with another double-double is almost averaging one with 14 ppg and 9.4 rebounds per game. As Santa Barbara’s offense is rolling, the Gauchos will likely work on their defensive game-plan this week before playing Thursday in an effort to cut down on fouls. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the Gauchos work Drea Toler back into games, Santa Barbara will aim to get back on track at home against UC Davis on Thursday, January 18.</span></p>\n<div

thus far.</p>\n<p>In their two Big West losses this season, UCSB has lost by a combined two points with both games being away from home at Cal Poly and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>That being said, the Gauchos will hope to improve and make the tournament this year as opposed to last year, which saw them miss the Big West Tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason for Santa Barbara’s turnaround has been the addition of graduate transfer forward Leland King II and the emergence of sophomore guard Max Heidegger.</p>\n<p>King II has helped the Gauchos on both ends of the floor, and he is a near shoe-in to win Big West Newcomer of the Year.</p>\n<p>He currently averages a double-double with 16.7 points per game, fourth-best mark in the conference and 10.2 rebounds per contest, the best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, the most shocking transformation has been that of Heidegger, who has completely transformed his game to become one of the most dangerous scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The sophomore currently leads the league in points per game with 21.6 and is lethal from beyond-the-arc, shooting 44.4 percent.</p>\n<p>The team’s quick turnaround also has a lot to do with new Head Coach Joe Pasternack who, in his first season, has already broken the best start by a rookie coach in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is no doubt that the Gauchos are the biggest surprise in the Big West this season, but the key will be if they can continue this in Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UCI at 9 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome, where the Gauchos are still undefeated.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State 49ers by Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>It has been nearly six years since the Long Beach State men’s basketball program won its last Big West Tournament title. The 49ers were winners of the 2012 conference tournament — their last conference title — and nearly pulled off an upset over No. 1 seeded Hawaii in the 2016 Big West championship game before ending their season with an NIT first round loss.</p>\n<p>Since its NIT appearance, the Beach has seesawed between being in the middle of the pack to a potential top-tier team within the Big West.</p>\n<p>The NIT and near NCAA tournament appearances certainly influenced the 49ers’ decision to boost last season’s strength of schedule as they began their non-conference slate against elite programs such as Wichita State, North Carolina, Louisville, UCLA and Washington. Unfortunately, this got the best of them as they lost all five games straight, which then extended to nine games prior to their first win of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>Now in the beginning stages of its 2017-18 Big West conference campaign, Long Beach State is currently in third place after a 84-75 loss to UC Davis on Wednesday, and are now 9-12 overall, 3-2 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Despite last season’s tough schedule backfiring, LBSU remained committed to challenging itself with games against premier non-conference opponents such as Arizona, Michigan State and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>Despite losing each game, senior forward Gabe Levin has been still managing to produce on the 49ers’ end. He leads LBSU in scoring and rebounds and is tied for the lead in steals with averages of 16.3 points, 7.2 rebounds per game and 22 steals. With just 8-of-30 three-pointers made on the season, it is evident that Levin is a dominant force for the 49ers in the paint and interior areas. Junior guard Bryan Alberts is the team’s second leading scorer at 14 PPG.</p>\n<p>LBSU will host Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m. and will be nationally televised by <em>FoxSportsWest</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly Mustangs by Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Junior point guard Donovan Fields carried the ball up the floor with less than a minute left in a Nov. 18 game at Santa Clara University in a pivotal moment in which his team needed a bucket to break the 59-59 tie.</p>\n<p>Fields’ 21 point effort was vital in keeping the Mustangs in the game all night, and it was the team looking at him again with just seconds on the clock.</p>\n<p>The junior answered the call and pulled up with 18 seconds left only to bury a jumper, giving the Mustangs the lead and the win.</p>\n<p>Much like that night against the Broncos, Fields has played a significant role for the Mustangs’ offense all season.</p>\n<p>The point guard leads the team in assists with 63, and his 13.2 points per game is good for second highest on the team this season.</p>\n<p>Senior Victor Joseph’s 13.8 points per game leads the team, and he is among one of the four players who have scored 100+ points so far this season, along with Fields, Jakub Niziol and Luke Meikle.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is off to yet another tough start. The Mustangs sit at 6-11 and 1-2 in Big West play. The team lost seven players from last year’s squad and despite filling a majority of those roster spots, the Mustangs still find themselves playing catch-up in this early part of the conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off an underwhelming December, in which the team lost five of its seven games and is hoping to bounce back.</p>\n<p>Thus far, January hasn’t been too friendly either.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost their last two consecutive conference games to CSUF and Hawaii following their conference-opener victory over UCSB that was decided at the free-throw line after a controversial foul call.</p>\n<p>Earning some wins is the next objective for the Mustangs, who went 6-10 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Cal Poly Mustangs play at UC Irvine Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m. on <em>ESPN3</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge Matadors by Kendra Jackson</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge Matadors currently possess a 4-14 overall record and sit at 1-3 in conference play, and earned its most recent win with a 66-57 victory over UCR Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Matadors ended with an 11-19 overall record and stood at 7-9 within Big West conference play, which clinched the No. 6 seed for them in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Northridge is a balanced team as far as its roster, having nine underclassmen and eight upperclassmen. Their struggles have become apparent as their only wins have been sporadic and have only been achieved on their home court.</p>\n<p>In comparing the current season status of the Matadors to that of last season, the differences are evident. In the 2016-2017 season, CSUN was 7-7 at home, but managed to win some away games, with a 4-8 away record.</p>\n<p>Their biggest streak was a losing streak of six, which all came towards the winding down point of the season, with their last game being a loss versus the team that would eventually eliminate them from championship contention, CSUF.</p>\n<p>Northridge opened up their season in November with a win against Life Pacific, but shortly after endured a run of eight losses in non-conference play.</p>\n<p>The Matadors now stand as the eighth seed, sitting only in front of UC Riverside, who is 5-14 overall and 0-5 within the Big West. CSUN is due to host Cal Poly on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine Anteaters by Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of last year’s impressive 12-4 Big West record that earned it the bragging rights of being the Big West’s regular season conference champion, the UCI men’s basketball team will look to establish consistency and make a redeeming return to the Big West Tournament Finals. However, it had a tough non-conference slate, which has contibuted to its current overall record of 7-13, while thus far the Anteaters have split their Big West conference matchups by a record of 2-2.</p>\n<p>After coming up just short in its 50-47 loss to UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Finals, UC Irvine has been in reflection mode as it prepares for perhaps another championship run. Big West Coach of the Year, Russell Turner, will once again work with his junior forward Jonathan Galloway, who placed second in the conference in rebounds per game. They will try to inspire a fresh new team that consists of almost three-fourths underclassmen.</p>\n<p>Following their most recent 71-54 victory on the road against the CSUN Matadors, the Anteaters’ current .500 win percentage has them sitting exactly at mid table in the Big West Men’s Basketball standings.</p>\n<p>Although they have had their fair share of close games, an indicator of UC Irvine’s early struggles can be found in their scoring differentials. As of late, the Anteaters have averaged 70.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, their opponents have tallied an average of 71.1 points per game. UC Irvine has also averaged a total of 15.3 turnovers each game, a staggering amount compared to its 10.8 forced turnovers average.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host the UC Irvine men’s basketball team this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii Rainbow Warriors by Brandon Victor</strong></p>\n<p>Just two years removed from upsetting Cal during the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Rainbow Warriors (12-5, 3-1) will look to improve upon last year, in which the team finished fifth in the Big West with an 8-8 conference record (14-16 overall).</p>\n<p>Despite being picked to once again finish fifth in the Big West and losing last season’s leading scorer in former star guard/forward Noah Allen, the Rainbow Warriors have implemented a balanced attack on the offensive end that has enabled them to average 73 points a game.</p>\n<p>“Our team strength is probably our balance,” Head Coach Eran Ganot said. “We have different guys who can step up and score for us on any given night. We play inside-out, play as a team and we share the ball really well.”</p>\n<p>While its 9-4 non-conf. start was encouraging, Hawaii was beating up on lesser competition. Against stronger opponents, the Rainbow Warriors have looked outmatched, losing by 13 to Nevada, 18 to Miami, 20 to Utah and 14 to Princeton.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we need to find consistency,” Ganot said.  “We’ve shown flashes, from a game-to-game basis and within games. I’m not sure if we’ve put together a complete game this year. We need to find an ability to find a consistent level.”</p>\n<p>Another potential concern heading into conference play is Hawaii’s lack of true road games. Hawaii split their first two conference games on the road, losing to Long Beach by eight before drubbing CSUN by 19.</p>\n<p>But Hawaii has always been dominant at home, and if it can even split their road games, the Rainbow Warriors are likely to finish near the top of the conference this season. Hawaii takes on UC Davis at home on Saturday, Jan. 20th at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis Aggies by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>Last season was a dream come true for the UC Davis men’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>After putting up a tremendous effort in the regular season, the team finished with a 23-13 overall mark and an 11-5 conference record. They then made program history, winning their first Big West Tournament title and an NCAA playoff match before having their historical run end against top-seeded Kansas.</p>\n<p>The player behind that historical run is Chima Moneke. He was a force to be reckoned with, averaging 14.6 points per game and 9.5 rebounds. Moneke earned Big West Newcomer of the Year honors as well as an All-Big West First Team nod.</p>\n<p>Moneke was the guy everyone was going to have their eye on, and it’s safe to say he has not disappointed.</p>\n<p>The senior forward has had an excellent season averaging 19.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest, both second-best marks in the Big West. He has been the biggest force in helping the Aggies reach an 11-6 overall mark and 2-1 conference record so far this season.</p>\n<p>Also, the brighter the stage, the bigger Moneke shines and stands out, allowing for his team to continue thriving and relying on their senior captain. In a game against Pac-12 opponent Washington State, Moneke finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds to lead UC Davis to the victory.</p>\n<p>Even with being picked to finish second in the conference by the media, there is no doubt that the Aggies will be tough to beat and will be on everyone’s mind come tournament time.</p>\n<p>UC Davis continues its run in Big West play against Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 20.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside Highlanders by Andrew Bishop</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Riverside Highlanders entered their 2017-18 season hoping to bounce back from a disappointing 2016-17 campaign that culminated in a record of 7-21. The Highlanders had a hot start, going 3-0 during a brief tour in Quebec, and upsetting Pac-12 powerhouse UC Berkeley on the road.</p>\n<p>Despite early successes, the remainder of the Highlanders’ season has been nothing short of turbulent. The Highlanders entered conference play with a record of 5-9, and shortly after, parted ways with their head coach of 5 years, Dennis Cutts. They are now 5-13 overall and remain winless in conference play at 0-4.</p>\n<p>Cutts went 50-87 at the helm of UC Riverside’s men’s basketball team, and was succeeded by Associate Head Coach Justin Bell, who will serve as the team’s interim head coach until a replacement is hired. Bell, a UC Riverside alumnus, has struggled to lead his team to victory in all of their four conference games, putting the Highlanders at 0-4 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Throughout the season, the Highlanders have distributed their point production somewhat evenly amongst their starters. Sophomore guard Dikymbe Martin has emerged as the team’s leader in scoring, averaging 13.1 points per game. The Highlanders have also relied heavily on their veteran players on offense, with redshirt senior guard Chance Murray and senior forward Alex Larsson averaging 10.8 and 10.6 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders have boasted solid performances from a few key players, it is clear that it will take more for them to be successful in the Big West. Bell and his players will look for their first conference win against UC Irvine next Wednesday, Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Behind an efficiently managed game, UCSB easily defeated Toronto 85-65. The Gauchos shot 46.7 percent and had nine turnovers, while limiting the Blues to 32.3 percent shooting and forcing 15 turnovers.</p>\n<p>With a travel day between Toronto and Ottawa, the Gauchos prepared for Carleton University, their toughest opponent on the tour.</p>\n<p>In front of a rowdy, sold out crowd at the Raven’s Nest, UCSB got off to a slow start. After Johnson scored the first basket of the game on a jumper, the Ravens went on an 11-0 run to take the early lead.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos were forced to play from behind for much of the game. Led by Johnson, the Gauchos outscored Carleton 21-9 to come within two points at halftime, 30-28.</p>\n<p>“It was a crazy game,” Nunnally said. “There were noisemakers, nobody was sitting down…”</p>\n<p>UCSB took its second lead of the game after a 7-2 run to start the third quarter, but the Ravens came back and led the rest of the way to a 71-61 win.</p>\n<p>“They executed and played hard,” Johnson said. “We just had a bad shooting night.”</p>\n<p>Attempting to rebound from the loss at Carleton, UCSB responded with a hard fought 67-65 victory over the University of Ottawa, followed by a dominating 87-69 victory over Concordia University of Montreal in the finale of the team’s Canadian road trip.</p>\n<p>UCSB will start practice again on October 15 to prepare for its upcoming season.</p>\n<p>“We are working hard, ready to make every practice count,” Nunnally said. “This is the last year for us seniors, and we want to work hard to make sure that we don’t come up short.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/gauchos-tour-canada-offseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/gauchos-tour-canada-offseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/gauchos-tour-canada-offseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/gauchos-tour-canada-offseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/gauchos-tour-canada-offseason/","id":839,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[838,837,836],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
