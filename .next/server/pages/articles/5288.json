However, the Gauchos were unable to hold on to a 2-1 lead, dropping the final two sets on the way to their first loss since late September.</p>\n<p>“It was a really good match; it was two very good teams going head-to-head,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “Sometimes things bounce your way a little bit more. The last two sets we lost by just a few points, so we were right in there.”</p>\n<p>The loss snaps the Gauchos’ eight-match winning streak, their longest since 2005, and puts them just one loss behind first place Cal State Northridge at 13-9 overall and 8-2 in the Big West. Hawaii improved its chances of staying in the Big West title race with the win and is now at 20-4 overall and 9-3 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This loss really fires us up for the remainder of conference,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “This will be in the back of our minds, and now we’re just going to want to crush everyone.”</p>\n<p>The match did not get off to an ideal start for UCSB, who needed an early timeout after falling behind 9-4 in the first set. After the timeout, Santa Barbara looked like the dominant team its been the past six weeks, taking the lead thanks to an 11-3 run.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded points the rest of the way until freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt ended it with a kill, making it 25-22 and giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Hawaii dominated the second set, winning it 25-15, but neither team was able to take control for the rest of the match. In a tight third set, both teams traded points on the way to a 23-23 tie. UCSB finally broke away on the last two points thanks to a kill from sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau and a tremendous service ace from Thompson, giving them a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In a heartbreaking fourth set, a run of five straight points gave the Gauchos a 17-15 lead and put them on the verge of upsetting the Rainbow Wahine for the second time this season. Hawaii answered back with four straight points however, and held on to win the set 25-22.</p>\n<p>“I felt like we gave them a lot of early free points,” Lantagne Welch said. “But we played very well from about six points in to the rest of the way and put ourselves in a position to win it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB began the fifth and final set poorly, falling behind 7-4. However, three straight blocks by freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg evened the game at 7-7. However, the effort wouldn’t be enough, eventually losing 15-12.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine were led on offense by the combination of Hartong and senior setter Mita Uiato. Hartong picked up 24 kills and 10 digs on the night while Uiato had 45 assists.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at UC Davis this Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of November 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52900\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-as-win-streak-snapped/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52900\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-as-win-streak-snapped/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-as-win-streak-snapped/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-as-win-streak-snapped/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-fall-to-hawaii-as-win-streak-snapped/","id":5288,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5287,5286,5285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN, Now Sit in First Place in the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/volleyball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB swept the season series against Northridge.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last Saturday, the UCSB women’s volleyball team played what was then its biggest match of the season against No. 12 Hawaii, coming up just short in a 3-2 loss. Exactly seven days later, the Gauchos took on first-place Cal State Northridge in a match with even bigger implications in deciding the Big West championship race. UCSB did something that it couldn’t do against Hawaii, prevailing with a thrilling 3-2 win and putting itself in the best position of any team to win the conference.</p>\n<p>The latest win gives UCSB a record of 15-9 overall and 10-2 in the Big West while dropping Northridge to 22-5 and 12-2. After completing the season sweep over the Matadors, the Gauchos earned the all important tie-breaker, which will give them first place if the two teams end the year with the same record. On Thursday, a 3-0 UCSB victory over UC Davis dropped the Aggies to 14-12 overall and 6-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>“It felt awesome.

However, UCSB made quick work of the Aggies this time around, following Spindt’s 14 kills and 17 digs to an easy 3-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Grunt was again a big factor, picking up eight kills on a .467 hitting percentage, while Sully led the defense with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“We really focused on our serving in practice which helped us a lot in both our games this weekend,” Spindt said. “We were just really focused and we knew these two games were really important.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face Fullerton Friday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-beat-csun-now-sit-in-first-place-in-the-big-west/","id":5285,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5284,5283,5282],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Serving It Up in the Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.23.2013-UCSB-Womens-Volleyball-vs-UCR-16.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/11.23.2013-UCSB-Womens-Volleyball-vs-UCR-16.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces No. 9-seed San Diego in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the first time since 2009, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>After finishing off their regular season with a 3-1 victory over UC Irvine, the Gauchos earned their first Big West championship since 2005, sharing it with No. 17 Hawaii and Cal State Northridge, and will travel to No. 14 San Diego for their first playoff match on Friday.</p>\n<p>“It’s an incredible honor to be one of only 64 teams represented in the NCAA tournament.

The Toreros, whose overall record of 24-3 was good enough to earn them the No. 9 seed in the tournament, defeated Santa Barbara, 3-0, back on Sep. 14.</p>\n<p>“I was kind of shocked after finding out we were playing them because I thought we were going to have a better seed in the bracket,” senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “But I was also super excited because they were the last team that swept us, so that definitely left an imprint on our brains. All we want to do now is go out and get some revenge on them.”</p>\n<p>After enduring a tough preseason, UCSB found something special right at the perfect time. The Gauchos went 13-2 over their final 15 matches, ending the season with a record at 18-10 overall and 13-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With its impressive regular season now concluded, UCSB’s outstanding play over the course of the season was acknowledged this past week with a remarkable five players named to the All-Big West teams.</p>\n<p>“I could not have asked for my teammates to play any better [this season],” Thompson said. “Every game, every practice they stepped up and took the challenge that we had in front of us and killed it.”</p>\n<p>Senior libero Leah Sully, who became UCSB’s all-time digs leader last weekend, was named to the All-Big West First Team along with Thompson and sophomore outside hitter Ali Barbeau. Freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt, who was named the Big West Freshman of the Year, also earned a spot on the First Team, and freshman middle blocker Phoebe Grunt was given an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>“For us to have so much representation on the All-Big West team was certainly something that shows how far we’ve come this year,” Lantagne Welch said. “Our results, obviously being tri-champions, and just having such a balanced team really showed in the All-Conference results.”</p>\n<p>Although USD dominated UCSB in the teams’ previous matchup, the Gauchos believe that they are a different team this time around.</p>\n<p>“Beating No. 5 Hawaii pretty much gave us the confidence to feel like we can take anyone down, so we’re not afraid,” Spindt said. “I don’t think they know what we’re [capable of].”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had great success against ranked teams this year, not only with its upset over Hawaii but also with two victories over the previously-No. 24 ranked Northridge. However, the Gauchos will need to be sharp in every aspect in order to come away with another upset.</p>\n<p>“[San Diego is] an excellent defensive team and their floor defense is what really shines,” Lantagne Welch said. “The biggest key for us is serving tough, and in addition we need to be sharp offensively and take advantage defensively when we get them out of system.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be looking to the trio of Thompson, Spindt and Barbeau to carry them on the offensive end. Thompson’s 3.25 kills per set average was good enough for third best in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to its defensive trio of Sully, Grunt and freshman middle blocker Allie Sullberg to try and slow down the fast paced Toreros offense. Sully finished the year with the most digs in the Big West despite only starting the last 16 matches at libero, while Grunt and Sullberg finished in first and third in blocks per set, respectively.</p>\n<p>“They run a very quick offense and they are very heavy with their middle and right side attack,” Lantagne Welch said. “That’s their bread and butter, so we need to be able to slow that down by serving tough, blocking well, and playing good defense.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s fierce offense is powered by one of the most balanced attacks in the nation with five players averaging 2.67 or more kills per set. Senior middle hitters Chloe Ferrari and Katie Hoekman lead the way for their team with incredible hitting percentages of .435 and .383, respectively. Ferrari will be the main emphasis for the Gauchos’ defense, as she was voted the 2013 WCC Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to approach it as any other game, but we’re super focused,” Spindt said. “Obviously we’re going to be extra pumped since we’re playing on such a big stage and we have this great opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos owe much of their success this year to Lantagne Welch, whose efforts in her first season as the team’s head coach earned her a Big West Co-Coach of the Year Award. After five trips to the NCAA tournament while coaching the University of Miami, her experience will surely be a boost for a young roster which, with the exception of Sully, has never played an NCAA tournament match.</p>\n<p>“She pushed us and influenced us in such positive ways,” Thompson said. Without her, I don’t think we could’ve made it to the NCAAs.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s match is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/53352/","id":5286,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5285,5284,5283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Tournament in Third Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VBall_Brocher.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VBall_Brocher.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos go 4-1 for third place finish in UCSB Asics Invitational","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s volleyball team rang in the new year and opened its season by hosting the 50th annual UCSB Asics Invitational.

The biggest difference between their performance in pool play and in their game on Saturday was their ability to deliver strong, consistent serves.</p>\n<p>“In the UC San Diego game we did a lot better,” Seif said. “We were in our home gym and we served really well so that got us a lot of points.”</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Matt Hanley led UCSB’s offense with 10 kills, and the Gauchos kept the pressure on San Diego by hitting .267 overall.</p>\n<p>“It was a good start for us, we learned a lot and now we know what we need to work on,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “We need to work on the mental aspect of following point to point … forgetting about the bad point and getting on to the next point.”</p>\n<p>With five returning starters, and an overall impressive performance in their first tournament, UCSB is sure to make its presence known in the MPSF this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ranked No. 8 in the nation in the AVCA Preseason Poll, while they were selected by conference coaches to finish seventh in the MPSF Conference.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot more mature team this year,” Seif said. “Last year we were younger and I think we were a little bit more hot headed, this year we are a lot more stable.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will next face UC Santa Cruz this Wednesday at 5 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/ucsb-finishes-tournament-in-third-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/ucsb-finishes-tournament-in-third-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/ucsb-finishes-tournament-in-third-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/ucsb-finishes-tournament-in-third-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/ucsb-finishes-tournament-in-third-place/","id":5287,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5286,5285,5284],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
