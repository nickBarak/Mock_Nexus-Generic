My heart sank. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not again.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exams had been appearing in my calendar incessantly. Routine took over my college days: class, work, study, research, work, study, sleep, repeat. The colorful EBT CalFresh card in my wallet had been untouched for a week … or two … and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, “skinny” translates into weak. This direct correlation comes from growing up remarkably underweight. Eating was a daily struggle. My lovely grandparents who raised me had no choice but to force food down my throat to keep me from becoming dangerously malnourished. When left unsupervised, I shoveled rice into my mouth before sneaking to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. I remember too vividly the countless evenings of sulking with my tear-streamed cheek on the wooden dining room table, not far from my chopsticks, small bowl of cold rice and various dishes of vegetables and Chinese sausages. I was genuinely repulsed by the thought of putting food into my body.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My unhealthy relationship with food continued roughly until the beginning of high school. I wanted to focus on reading books, completing an endless stack of worksheets and organizing my chores. I wanted to get things done. I couldn’t afford to simply just sit there and consume various substances for so many minutes of the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet, I desperately wished that the people around me would state something besides the obvious; even at such a young age, I was sick of being defined by my strikingly thin figure. Why did my weight matter? What if I just had a high metabolism? What do they know? During what seemed to be the longest years of my life, I grew increasingly weary of people telling me that I had to eat. At gatherings, my aunts, uncles, cousins and family friends voiced the same annoying comment: “You’re so skinny!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obligatorily, I began consuming the food that was placed in front of me without having a tantrum about it. Overlapping food groups in my bowl was still unacceptable, but I stopped passing the protein off to my sisters, living with the mindset that eating was just a required chore in order to get on with the rest of the day. I’m not sure what triggered my sudden desire to please the people around me. Or maybe I was just fed up. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unique biological nature of every individual makes it impossible for everyone to maintain the same figure, but that’s not what the media advertises.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he differences were noticeable: As I gradually stopped handing off (and flushing down) my food, focusing on the present became significantly easier. Academics were much more tolerable; socializing was no longer so draining. I was daydreaming significantly less. Of course, the correlation between eating more and becoming a livelier person was not immediately evident but revealed itself over time. Eventually, I even started taking the initiative to make plans</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to go out and eat with friends. For the first time in my life, I was no longer 10 to 20 pounds underweight. My doctor was extremely proud of me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many people who struggle with being underweight, my extreme lack of appetite was and still is a massive side dish for my familiar main course: stress. From time to time, I find myself ignoring what my body wants and needs, especially when I am determined to complete a task or project before a deadline. Every individual responds to stress differently; I was briefly prone to stress eating, but I am learning that my body prefers neglecting food instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can tell when I’m losing weight: I go throughout my day subconsciously aiming to consume the bare minimum of each food group, allowing my thoughts and fears to feed my appetite instead. Sometimes, I check myself by thinking about my sister’s banana bread; I know it’s bad when even the thought of her baking doesn’t seem appealing. It’s important that I am aware of when this happens, so I can take a step back and reorder my priorities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, “skinny” is viewed as “healthy.” The issue with ideal body images is that weight is based on heavily malleable variables of standard body weight, shapes and other physical attributes. The unique biological nature of every individual makes it impossible for everyone to maintain the same figure, but that’s not what the media advertises. People need to feel more encouraged to work with, rather than against, their natural genetic compositions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undoubtedly, people still call me “skinny” today, but I no longer care about how others see me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest difference between my past-skinny and present-skinny self is my newfound focus on positive mental energy and physical strength. For my body, this combination can only be achieved by eating certain amounts and types of foods, such as by moderating my Hot Cheetos Puffs and strawberry-flavored Pocky intakes. After discovering the hard way how diet impacts my mindset and energy level, my goal is not to count calories. Adding up the numbers every day would not benefit my mental health, so I don’t do it. I know people who rely on numbers to keep them feeling their best, and I respect that. Each body is different, so do what works for you. But I say that self-care is the new skinny.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anna Zhou wants to increase her physical strength so she can haul her groceries up the stairs in one go. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/why-skinny-feels-heavy/","id":5671,"author":{"id":376,"name":"Anna Zhou"},"related":[5670,5669,5668],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":376,"name":"Anna Zhou","biography":"Not available","articles":[5671],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Girls Have Hair, Why Should I Care?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Flesh Prison","publish_date":"2020-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Body-Hair-Article-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Body-Hair-Article-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"\"Let's just let the hairy girls live,\" exclaims Anabel Costa as she urges readers to do as they damn please with their body hair.

My arms were hairy, my legs were hairy, my eyebrows looked like caterpillars — the whole works. I’m proud to say that by the time I got to high school, I was already kind of over it. Who the fuck cares if I have hair on my arms? Of course, every so often a blunt child I was babysitting would still point it out, but it just didn’t bother me the way it used to. I assumed that anyone else who had suffered these insecurities was probably over it by now, too. It wasn’t until I learned that one of my best friends shaved her arms about as frequently as she shaved her legs that I realized this was still a problem for women my age.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we care so much about regulating female body hair? It all starts with razor companies. </span><a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillette patented the safety razor in 1904</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it grew in popularity, being clean shaven became a symbol of basic hygiene. This made at least a little sense at the time: Because many people were living in close quarters and had limited access to bathing, shaving was seen as a way to prevent lice and bacteria. This idea was </span><a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/shaving-ads-1920s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily marketed to men</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; to be clean shaven was to be a hygienic and civilized man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1920s, things began to change. With a new decade came new fashion trends, and we all know what the 20s are famous for: flapper dresses. This meant that women’s hairy armpits and legs were on full display. </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/137072-100-years-of-shaving-ads-show-how-weve-been-tricked-into-going-hairless-photos\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Razor companies saw this as an opportunity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell more razors and began telling women they needed to be smooth. The epidemic spiraled from there, and now generations of women are worried about everything from the hair between their eyebrows to the knuckles of their toes and everything in between. A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s pretty fucking ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, so I decided to talk to other women about their relationships to their body hair and how they may or may not have come to embrace it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first woman I talked to was Nisha Jagota, a fourth-year student here at UCSB. One memory that Jagota shared was from fifth grade, when she and her friends discussed what they should and shouldn’t shave before a pool party. “We all got together as a group, like, ‘okay, what’s acceptable, what should we do?’ Nobody had it figured out. Nobody has a good idea of what’s ’right’ so everything’s really convoluted,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From as young an age as 10 or 11, girls already know that they will be judged. They know that there is a “right” and a “wrong,” but the standard is so arbitrary that they’re left guessing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagota told me that she hasn’t worried too much about her body hair since coming to UCSB. One of the biggest moments for her in the journey of her changing relationship with her body hair was participating in the Vagina Monologues and spending time with other women who wore their hair however they wanted to. “It was really great being surrounded by all different types of women, and nonbinary folk as well,” she said. “And visually seeing women who had unshaved armpits wearing tank tops and bras … I’m not gonna say they were making a statement, because maybe they’re not, maybe it’s just for them, but for me, it really was them making a statement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madi Braum, another student here at UCSB, had a similar experience after leaving high school. “I started shaving my legs consistently when I was in sixth grade, before I even really needed to,” she said. “But for years after that, I refused to go outside the house in shorts if my legs weren’t shaved.” After graduating from high school, however, Braum said something “clicked,” and she hasn’t shaved since. It’s been three years since she put a razor blade to her shins.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dana Laufer is a third-year student at UCSB, and her first memory of being shamed for her body hair is from fifth grade. “I raised my hand in class to answer a question, and a girl said, ‘Oh my god, Dana has armpit hair.’” When she went home that day, she told her mom what happened, and she taught Dana how to use Nair to remove the hair from her armpits, resulting in painful burns that kept her from attending school the following day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Dana got to high school, shaving felt more like an option than a necessity. “My brother used to say it was gross when girls don’t shave their legs,” she said, “but in high school, my friend and I used to have competitions to see who could go the longest without shaving their legs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no interest in telling anyone how they should maintain the hair on their body. I personally like it when my legs are smooth. However, had I not been socialized to believe that hairy legs are gross, it might be a different story. More than anything, I want every person to be able to make choices that work for them without being subjected to any outside pressure. Let’s just let hairy girls live. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants women to do whatever they damn want with their body hair.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

While the amount and content of coursework is comparable, I came to appreciate my previous experiences in open debate and in-depth student presentations. At home, TAs were mainly in charge of sparking discussion through controversy based on readings rather than desperately trying to find a student to read aloud the assigned weekly paper and then spend the rest of section summarizing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first year, students were essentially thrown in at the deep end, a phenomenon which is exemplified by the absence of prompts in essay assignments. While this may seem daunting, it effectively taught me how to structure and develop a thesis beyond set standards of what is considered right or wrong. Rather than myopically following instructions, this teaching style facilitated the formation of opinions and proved rewarding both academically, by improving argumentative originality, as well as personally, by inducing the feeling of having produced my own work.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83730\" style=\"width: 422px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83730\" data-attachment-id=\"83730\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-24/sheriffs-deputies-discover-human-remains-near-del-playa-beach/screen-shot-2018-07-25-at-9-20-42-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=2048%2C989&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,989\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-07-25 at 9.20.42 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?fit=888%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-83730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM-250x121.png?resize=412%2C199\" alt=\"\" width=\"412\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=768%2C371&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?resize=1024%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-9.20.42-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my global studies courses here are filled with data, graphs and theoretical concepts which are, of course, essential to understanding the topic, yet often counterproductive in initiating debate. While students are on top of their game in factual knowledge given the frequency of homework, quizzes and midterms (which seem to arise at any point but in the middle of term), a critical approach to controversial issues is seldom asked for. Questions on the part of the students are not non-existent but largely directed toward the study guide for the next quiz and clarifications or definitions, which students then obediently type into their MacBooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of my classes, we are supposed to analyse highly ambivalent philosophical texts. Our first paper encouraged institutions to consider students as co-creators of education rather than mere recipients. Having read it, I could not wait for potentially controversial discussions in the gloomy halls of I.V. Theater. In contrast to the critical theory, however, the lecture was a pinpointed summary rather than an analysis, let alone a critique. Ironically, the main thesis — thinking for yourself — of this and subsequent readings seemed like a distant utopia, essentially desirable but expressed in too old a document to apply to our classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corresponding sections nipped any serious debate in the bud by featuring enjoyable yet awkwardly long surveys about our personal lives and monotonous monologues by a TA who seemed to have turned the section into an emotional support group. This is not to downplay the importance of connecting with your peers, but it is quite telling regarding the apparent disinterest of some teaching staff in conveying critical analysis skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessment through multiple choice quizzes effectively tests diligence but undervalues opinion and coherent argumentation, which could be practiced in presentations or group discussions. A clear imperative by professors to respond to exam questions in a way that “resembles the way we talked about them in class” restricts the possibility of an independent and personal analysis from the start. One gets the impression that students are primarily supposed to learn rather than think, let alone learn how to think critically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting to know regular UCSB students during my first weeks in I.V., I experienced the wider social and personal implications to this particular structure of academic life. There appears to be a broad consensus on a clear separation between university and the social environment. “Do your work and then enjoy life” is a motto I have often heard around other Gauchos.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When connecting this experience to the wider social life, it struck me that the largely mechanical learning ideology has counterproductive effects on overall student interaction and may create a negative attitude towards pursuing an academic degree in the first place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than seeing both academia and social life as something that can be unified through subject-related discussions with friends while chugging Natty Daddy’s at Sands, classwork appears to be more like a part-time job than a life-shaping endeavour. Of course, we all finish our essays in the last minute and go out to crash Friday parties on DP, but almost no one comes back to discussing the controversies of the essay topic once sobering up with friends and munching on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jesus Burgers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not at all to demand nerdy discussions or to put an end to the marvelousness of casual trash talk for the sake of upkeeping academic rigour and obsession. It is to say that given a sincere interest in your degree subject, there should be a lot more to most class readings and assignments than the feeling of relief you get when scratching them off your to-do list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being critical of the lack of critical thinking also requires a critical approach to one’s own views. These observations are the source of a highly subjective eight-week experience of an I.V. newcomer. Naturally, this is also a highly restricted depiction of academic life given that the discussion or lack thereof regarding moral controversies are mostly found in the social sciences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends from home FaceTime me and ask about my study abroad experience, I excitedly tell them about I.V.’s welcoming culture, the inexhaustible supplies of the A.S. Food Bank and the electrifying feeling of liberation during sunset surfs. But I also tell them about the one-sided academic culture of memorization and how I miss controversial discussions and self-determined studying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My academic culture shock at UCSB has been not so much about the content of the classes but about the way they are taught. By following a high school doctrine of internalizing information instead of analysis-based teaching, the class structure hampers independent thinking and debate between and among students and staff. Consequently, students themselves demand to be taken by the hand and guided through the jungle of homework assignments instead of following their academic passions through specialisation and research. While debating with a friend about the outline of this opinion piece, we realised that the nature of teaching at UCSB has not yet allowed for one of the most exciting and valuable characteristics of university life: learning from your peers. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens encourages UCSB students and staff to foster independent thinking and meaningful discussions both inside and outside the classroom. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf63503ba78bd4c17a04ab3f91476f1?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simon-ahrens/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simon Ahrens</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simon Ahrens is a second-year Global Studies study-abroad student.

It was a tightly contested matchup until the fourth period, as utility Sarah Snyder scored a brace to keep the Gauchos in the game until the Bruins scored a few goals late in the match. Now in her senior year, Snyder will again have to show out for UCSB to have success not just in the opener, but throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder led the team in goals last season (66) and also was selected to the All-Big West Second Team, while her younger sister utility Caitlyn Snyder made a splash with 30 goals and a team-leading 33 assists to go along with her Big West All-Freshman selection. If the sibling duo can continue their production from last season early on, it will be a great sign for the team moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has two games scheduled for Saturday, the first in the morning coming against Iona and the second being a mid-day marquee matchup against UC Berkeley. The Golden Bears will be a relatively new opponent for Santa Barbara, as their game last year was cancelled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal is a traditional water polo powerhouse, and this year’s team maintains that tradition with plenty of potential olympians. One standout star on the team so far is junior goalkeeper Cassidy Ball, who was just named Mountain Pacific Sports Federation player of the week after notching 12 saves and an unusual goal in the team’s season opening win against San Jose State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the Gauchos should feel comfortable going up against the Iona Gaels, if last year’s 14-0 whalloping is any indication. That matchup in the 2019 ASU Cross Conference Challenge ended up being the only shutout of the season for UCSB with current junior Becca Buck’s goalkeeping leading the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buck and senior Kenzi Snyder will be sharing the majority of the goalie duties this season for Santa Barbara, as both are looking to build off of a great 2018-19 season. The former had a solid sophomore season in the goal, notching a career-high 107 saves on the year to go along with a .677 save percentage. Snyder put together an incredible junior campaign, leading the team in saves (211), winning multiple Big West Player of the Week awards and ultimately earning a spot on the All-Big West Second Team as well. The pair of goalies will be the key to anchoring the defense as the season wears on, and it will be interesting to see if freshman goalkeeper Lucy Jackman can earn some minutes as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos close out the weekend with a pair of games on Sunday against Michigan and Ottawa University – Arizona. The Wolverines have the potential to be the toughest opponent that UCSB will face all weekend, as they are coming off of an extremely successful 2018-19 season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michigan made it to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time in a row and also won its fourth straight Collegiate Water Polo Association championship last year. Although they ended up losing a few seniors from that championship squad, which included a few members of the Australian national team, this is still an experienced and hungry team looking for a hot start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This opening slate of games will be a great opportunity for UCSB to see how it currently measures up against some of the top teams in the country. While the Gauchos have a long season ahead of them, it would be nice to get off to a hot start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
