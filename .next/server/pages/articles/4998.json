Their .029 hitting percentage looked even worse against the Aggies’ .400 mark, and they would go on to lose by 10 points despite first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s four kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos got out to an early lead, a 6-1 Davis run would put the Gauchos in a 9-12 hole, and they weren’t able to close the gap under two for the remainder of the set.</p>\n<p>Facing an end to their recent hot streak, the Gauchos launched their comeback in the third set when an 8-9 deficit became a 16-9 lead, aided by seven straight Ruddins serves.</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Annie Hasselmann started the run with a kill on an assist by redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Sydney Bast, followed by senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and Hasselmann contributing a block to further shift the tide.</p>\n<p>A Ruddins service ace pushed the lead to two, tying the second highest lead to that point in the set, and a kill from Elizabeth Sheffield resulted in a UC Davis timeout.</p>\n<p>They would find no help in the respite, however, as an attack error from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom, followed by two Ruddins service aces and another Sheffield kill, capped the stretch at 16-9 UCSB, a buffer that would extend throughout the set.</p>\n<p>UC Davis would not go down easily in the fourth set, as three kills from first-year outside hitter Lauren Matias contributed to a five-point run that would tie the game at 12.</p>\n<p>Despite the burst, UCSB would never trail again, as a continuous back-and-forth culminated with two kills from first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen and a 25-23 Gaucho victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB controlled the tiebreaker, hitting a whopping .538 and winning 15-6, as after the Aggies took a 2-0 lead to start, a 12-3 run by the Gauchos would essentially seal the match.</p>\n<p>The comeback from a two-set deficit was enabled by a career evening from outside hitter Chloe Allen, whose 19 kills, .394 hitting percentage, six digs and two block assists were massive for the Gauchos, especially as junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman went down with an injury in last week’s match against Cal Poly and was unable to play against Davis.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins and Elizabeth Sheffield were also both rocking on the offensive end with 16 and 14 kills respectively. Ruddins added three service aces as well as 10 digs to give herself a double-double, and Sheffield continued her consistent efficiency, hitting .481 on the night.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley led the match with 40 assists and completed a double-double of her own with 11 digs, extending her streak of outstanding play that has coincided with the Gauchos’ recent run.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had five players finish with at least eight kills, paced by senior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht with 11. Their setters, sophomore Maddie Merlino and senior Sophia Mar, combined for 43 assists, as the two setters’ attack potency was on full display Thursday night.</p>\n<p>UC Davis outside hitters first-year Lauren Matias and sophomore Emily Allen collected 11 digs each, completing double-doubles with their kills, and Sophia Mar’s 11 digs also gave her a double-double for the match.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match with UC Irvine was substantially less dramatic, exemplified by the Gauchos outhitting the Anteaters by at least .050 in each of the three sets.</p>\n<p>The first set was the match’s closest, as despite holding a three-to-four-point lead for the majority of the frame, the Anteaters were able to get a couple big scores and pull within two when faced with game point 24-20.</p>\n<p>An attack error on senior setter Shelley Anderson would seal their fate, however, as UC Irvine couldn’t capitalize on what would be their high watermark of the evening.</p>\n<p>The second and final sets would play out similarly to one another, as both began with decent competition between the two teams; they were tied at 11 in the second, and the Gauchos held an 11-10 run in the third.</p>\n<p>Massive runs in each game by the Gauchos would follow in each set, however, and neither featured any substantial late-set drama.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was huge for the Gauchos in this one, with 15 kills, eight service aces and nine digs, almost completing a triple-double. Megan Rice, Chloe Allen, Elizabeth Sheffield and senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt would all assist her offensively, chipping in at least seven kills apiece.</p>\n<p>Libero Emilia Petrachi turned in a brilliant performance with 20 digs (6.67 digs per set), and set the tone for what was an unstoppable Gaucho defense. Sheffield assisted in three blocks, and Hannah Juley and Sydney Bast added seven and 11 digs respectively.</p>\n<p>No one on UC Irvine was able to amass double-digit kills, though junior libero Luna Tsujimoto led the match with 22 digs.</p>\n<p>Setter Shelley Anderson was also potent for the Anteaters, her 27 assists a team high and second in the match only to UCSB’s Hannah Juley, who finished with 10 more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try and push their winning streak to five next weekend at home, with Friday and Saturday matches against Cal state Fullerton and UC Riverside, respectively. Both matches are at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsb-winners-in-four-straight-sweeps-ucd-uci-over-weekend/","id":4998,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4997,4996,4995],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Weekend Split Might Have Dashed Postseason Hopes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB split its weekend series after defeating Cal Poly, but falling flat against UCR in a tough match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74168\" style=\"width: 656px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74168\" data-attachment-id=\"74168\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/wvball_vsucr-161112-dustinharris-06-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wvball_vsucr-161112-dustinharris-06-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-74168\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WVball_vsUCR-161112-DustinHarris-06-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=646%2C431\" alt=\"After missing a block in the middle, Megan Rice, Phoebe Grunt and Chloe Allen struggle for the ball.

The 3-2 victory earned the Highlanders the season sweep over UCSB after the Gauchos’ 3-1 win over Cal State Fullerton Friday night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara concluded the weekend 17-10 overall and is now 8-6 in Big West play. The losing woes continued for the Titans, who are now 6-22, 1-13 after losses to UCSB and Cal Poly extended their losing streak to 13 matches. UCR ended its two-game skid with the victory over UCSB and currently sits at 8-18 and 3-11 in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB dropped its first match against the Highlanders on Oct. 14 in four sets, and Saturday’s rematch proved to be even more competitive with Riverside winning in a fifth set 23-25, 25-21, 9-25, 25-21, 15-11.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The disappointing outcome came on the heels of a fifth-straight victory for UCSB after defeating Cal State Fullerton. Cal State Fullerton proved to be a worthy opponent despite their 1-11 Big West record (6-20 overall) entering the match, outlasting the Gauchos 27-25 in the first set.</p>\n<p>UCSB was taking no part in a close contest for the rest of the match, however, as a 10-point run to start the second set led to the Gauchos holding the Titans under 18 in each of the final three games.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense was immaculate in those three sets, as Cal State Fullerton wasn’t able to hit above .185, plummeting in the third set with a -.077 kill percentage and seven errors. UCSB’s offense also steadily improved throughout the match, peaking in the final set when it hit .387 with only two errors.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins was in spectacular form throughout the evening, compiling 27 kills with only four errors, a .411 kill percentage and 15 digs, completing yet another double-double. A career-high in kills for the outside hitter, Ruddins also provided five service aces and was by far the most dominant player on the court.</p>\n<p>She was aided heavily by fellow redshirt freshman setter Hannah Juley, who also contributed a double-double with 14 digs and a match-high 47 assists. Juley was also feeling it from the service line, joining Ruddins and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast as the three Gaucho players with at least three aces.</p>\n<p>Sophomore libero Emilia Petrachi topped 20 digs for the second-straight match, finishing with 21 on the evening and providing the defensive spark that allowed the Gauchos to dominate after a shaky first set.</p>\n<p>Sophomores outside hitter Madeline Schneider, middle blocker Summer Kerins and outside hitter Shimen Fayad each had at least eight kills for the Titans, though Fayad was the only player to breach double-digits with 13.</p>\n<p>Fayad was able to notch a double-double as well with 11 digs, second most on the team to first-year defensive specialist Madisen Babich’s 16. Freshman setter Rachel Hall was also impressive throughout, her 37 assists good for just under 10 per set.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos riding a tremendous hot streak, heading into their match versus UC Riverside appeared an easy task for the ascending Gauchos as UCR is second to last in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>UCSB would take a close opening set 25-23, a late Riverside run giving the Gauchos their first scare of the night, as they had held the fellow UC at a comfortable distance for most of the game. The Highlanders controlled the second, though a late 7-2 run from the Gauchos, including two of first-year outside hitter Megan Rice’s eight kills, brought UCSB within two.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside had little trouble finishing the job, however, as two kills from junior middle blocker Meg Graham contributed to a comfortable second-set Highlander victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to turn the corner in the third, playing one of their best sets of the season on the way to a 25-9 win. UCSB hit .400 in the game, compared to a -.172 for the Highlanders, and forced 10 turnovers while limiting itself to only one.</p>\n<p>After gaining a 15-11 advantage in the fourth, a six-point Riverside run proved sufficient to force a fifth set. They carried their momentum into the tie-breaker, grabbing an early 9-5 lead before a quick four-point retort from the Gauchos locked the teams in yet another draw.</p>\n<p>A 6-2 run by the Highlanders clinched the match as the Gauchos fell just short and dropped to two games behind Cal Poly for third place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Emilia Petrachi again paced the Gauchos with 21 digs, her third-straight match with 20-plus. Lindsey Ruddins, Megan Rice, senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt, senior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield and first-year outside hitter Chloe Allen all had at least eight kills, though Allen’s hitting percentage of .242 was the highest of the bunch, as errors were a steady issue for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Hannah Juley had 47 digs for the second-straight match, eight more than UC Riverside’s sophomore setter Chelsea Doyle. Doyle completed a double-double with 14 digs, and was one of four Highlanders with at least 13.</p>\n<p>One of those four was senior outside hitter Cristina Maietta, whose 14 digs, 17 kills and two aces accounted for a large portion of her team’s production. Four UCR players also had at least 10 kills, including middle blockers Meg Graham and junior Brooke Callahan, as well as first-year outside hitter Mickayla Sherman.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ postseason hopes took a major hit this weekend, but the team will still try to finish the season on a positive note with its final two matches next week.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Hawaii Saturday, Nov.13 for its second match against the Rainbow Wahine before hosting UC Irvine Wednesday, Nov. 23 for the final match of the 2016 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-14/gauchos-weekend-split-might-have-dashed-postseason-hopes/","id":4995,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4994,4993,4992],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Earns First Conf.

A Second-Team All-Big West selection last season, Murphy was named the tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>Enabling UCSB to reach the championship round was the fourth-year player’s game-winning goal in the second sudden victory period of the game following two overtime periods and one sudden victory session.</p>\n<p>“Sam really stepped it up this weekend. She was on the outside, inside, in transition, I mean she was everywhere,” Kay explained. “She’s co-captain with Lauren so she holds a big leadership role on the team. Additionally, she’s Big West scholar of the year, she’s got a 4.0 GPA. She’s the whole package.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the productive weekend performance of Murphy was UCSB’s attentive defense as it held each of its opponents to six or less goals, nearly two goals below its average allowance of 8.07 entering its contest versus the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ defense was most effective in the first half of Sunday’s matchup as they shutout Hawaii in the second period following their allowance of just one goal in the opening quarter of the game. Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a total of seven saves.</p>\n<p>Although Murphy would go on to tally her third hat trick in the second half of Sunday’s game, the scoring contributions of redshirt center Lauren Martin with a first half hat trick, senior attacker Bryn Hudson, and junior utility Taylor Shore helped UCSB earn a 5-1 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Rainbow Wahine managed to limit the Gauchos to one goal in the third period, Hawaii was unable to transform its defense into offense as freshman attacker Hannah Thompson was the lone goal scorer in the playing frame, which didn’t have much of a toll of the tam’s deficit as it still trailed 6-2.</p>\n<p>Despite scoring three goals in the game’s final period, Hawaii’s inconsistencies on defense hindered its comeback attempt as UCSB responded with five goals of its own to secure its championship victory.</p>\n<p>Included within UCSB’s championship run was an 8-4 win over No. 24 Cal State Northridge and its 7-6 sudden victory over No. 7 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>As a winner of three national championships in her four seasons as a starter at UCLA from 1996-2000, Coach Kay is hoping to integrate her extensive postseason experience along with her coaching abilities in preparing the Gauchos for their first NCAA appearance.</p>\n<p>“Something I learned as a player and throughout my coaching years going to the ‘Big Dance,’ it’s important to keep things in perspective,” Kay said. “We got here because of our hard work, team defense, and paying attention to the details and that’s what makes the difference. From my UCLA days, [according to a] John Wooden quote — ‘Little things makes big things happen,’ and that’s what we focused on this year and it worked.”</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will be held at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center from Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. The tournament’s selection show concerning team seedings and matchups will take place tonight beginning at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/no-9-ucsb-earns-first-conf-title-and-ncaa-bid-in-program-history/","id":4996,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4995,4994,4993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take on Reigning Champion in No. 2 Stanford","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WWaterPolov_CSUN_4-16-16_JoseOchoa-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first ever Big West Conference title, the No. 7 UCSB women's water polo team will attempt to pull off one of the biggest upsets in NCAA water polo history against reigning champion N...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This year’s Big West Tournament was an unforgettable moment for the No. 7 UCSB women’s water polo team.

The Gauchos are set to face the No. 2 Stanford Cardinals in the first round as announced in the NCAA Selection Show the following Monday after Santa Barbara’s title victory.</p>\n<p>The Cardinals, who ended their regular season with a 21-5 overall record, were the runners up this year in the MPSF Tournament. Stanford lost to the top-ranked team in the nation, USC, after a dominating fourth quarter by the Trojans in which they put away five goals, making it difficult for the Cardinals to come back.</p>\n<p>After the decision was announced as to who UCSB would face, it was time to go right back to the drawing board and begin preparing for this weekend.</p>\n<p>Both UCSB and Stanford faced each other earlier this season in March, ending with the Cardinals prevailing with a crushing 16-5 victory over the Gauchos. While UCSB will enter Friday as the underdog against a powerhouse in Stanford, the Gauchos have shown resilience week after week, having endured just two losses since their loss to Stanford.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the greatest advantage that the Cardinals possess is their postseason experience. But the Gauchos remain determined to keep things afloat with their performance in the pool.</p>\n<p>“Nothing changes for us,” Kay explained. “We will be great competitor’s with the same mindset we had at Big West Championships. [We will continue to] focus on being present and pay attention to the little things.”</p>\n<p>Since the commencement of the NCAA Women’s Water Polo Championship back in 2001, Stanford is the only program to make an appearance every single year. This year, the Cardinals are on the hunt for their fifth national title in the past six seasons and what could be the sixth in program history. Stanford currently reigns as the national champions for the past two consecutive years.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara on the other hand has never been to the “Big Dance” before, but will be guided by the past playing experience of Head Coach Serela Kay.</p>\n<p>As a four-season starter at UCLA, Coach Kay won three national championships from 1996-2000.</p>\n<p>“This is the same water polo game we have played all season, now we are all just dressed up like prom,” Kay said. “It is important to remember water polo is not rocket science – put the yellow ball in the back of their net and keep it out of ours.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that with Coach Kay in charge of the team anything can be accomplished. In only two short years at UCSB she has helped UCSB claim the Big West Tournament title for the first time ever and also became the first coach in program history to be named Big West Coach of the Year. Most notably, Kay is the first coach not from UC Irvine or Hawai’i to receive the honors.</p>\n<p>To add on to the list of records, this year five Gauchos were named to the All Big-West team, three of them to the First team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had just four other honorees over a span of seven years. The three players that received the First team accolades are the Gauchos’ group of seniors in center Lauren Martin, utility Samantha Murphy and goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson managed to move up from her honorable mention honor last season to Second team this year, and junior utility Taylor Shore received honorable mention for the first time.</p>\n<p>Helping guide Santa Barbara to its conference title victory was the outstanding play of Murphy, who was also named the tournament’s MVP after recording three hat tricks in three-straight matches and a record nine goals. She also finished second on the team with 72 points, 40 goals, 32 assists, and 36 steals.</p>\n<p>Not all her accomplishments are in the pool though. The San Jose native was recently named the 2015 Big West Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>\n<p>Another strong force in the paint for UCSB is a two time Big West Player of the Week recipient in Martin,who finished her senior season strong after coming off the bench. She led the team in scoring with a team-high of 49 goals and an impressive .505 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Complementing the Gauchos’ potent offense was their stout defense as well. Fortunately for the Gauchos,  they had Brokaw defending the cage. The fourth-year goalie registered 267 saves this season, 60 more than the second best finish on the team, averaging 8.9 per game.  Going into this weekend, she is only 10 short from moving up one spot to third on the All-Gaucho list.</p>\n<p>“I expect us to continue to ride the wave we are on – with a championship mindset, having each others back, and competing in every minute and every second of the game no matter what,” said Coach Kay on the team’s expectations this weekend.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Tournament will take place at the UCLA Spieker Aquatics Center beginning Friday, May 13 through Sunday, May 15. UCSB is set to face Stanford at 1:45 p.m.</p>\n<p>The winner of Friday’s match will advance to a Saturday semifinal against the victor of the tournament’s first game between UCLA and either UC San Diego or Whittier. Those two will meet in one play-in, while the other will pit San Diego State against Wagner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/gauchos-take-on-reigning-champion-in-no-2-stanford/","id":4997,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[4996,4995,4994],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
