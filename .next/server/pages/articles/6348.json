Sure, you might run into that hunky hulk in the workplace, but odds are that your choice of lover from such an enclosed setting will be risqué, unnecessary and reputation-ruining. Kudos to you if the office adventure blossoms into a beatific bond, but try to steer away from potential gossip and awkward encounters in a place in which you wish to excel professionally.</p>\n<p>His: Ask yourself one question: Is there a future for you where you’re working? If yes, you two are probably going to be seeing each other everyday for years to come, so don’t get sensual. But if you’re just working at the local McDonald’s while you’re home for summer, and she’s giving you the signs … ain’t nothing wrong with a little bump ‘n grind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Friends</p>\n<p>Hers: Ah, this one can get sticky. Have a feel — actually, have a good grope — for your pal’s “friends with benefits” mindset. Set guidelines. Unless you don’t give a flying fuck how your relationship with the amorous amigo turns out post-naughtiness, then be sure you differentiate emotional intimacy from skin-timacy. Have fun, but know what you want. Sometimes seeing the banging buddy get along well with your friends and family can shoot you straight into a world of feelings and attachment. And that, my reader, is when the stickiness doesn’t wash off.</p>\n<p>His: If she’s close enough to know your family dog’s name is Harvey Dent, you would have to gamble your friendship on whether or not you two will work as a couple. Chances are you will not be able to have casual sex with that kind of pre-existing emotional attachment; you’ll either become a great couple or just an awkward pair of people who have now seen each other naked and don’t know how to feel about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Date</p>\n<p>Hers: The questions I would ask are: “How horny are you?” and “How inhumanly irresistible is your date?” I must admit that I’ve committed the first date love-makin’ once before. The relationship that ensued was beautiful, but the physicality diluted the mental connection we shared. So let’s make this a no-no. If you want that bod, just ask for the bod. If you can’t get that bod, then that’s not my problem.</p>\n<p>His: Unless you’re 2 Chainz and you “love bad bitches” and that’s your “fuckin’ problem,” you’ll most likely agree that it’s risky to light the candles and whip out the Marvin Gaye on day one for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p>1. Sleaze factor: You can’t help but wonder that if she’s ready for me on day one, who else is getting this kind of treatment?</p>\n<p>2. The Natural Order: It’s much easier to become friends before the first hump than it is to try to go back and get to know each other afterwards. You might feel satisfied, but you’ll probably never know if she shares your love for Batman.</p>\n<p>Just think if you’re in it for tonight or tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Party</p>\n<p>Hers: For me, kissing competency is a huge turn on or off factor. Slobber fest in my mouth? Good bye and good riddance. But for the others who don’t predestine their party sexcapades by an oral ultimatum, I say, “Why not?” Check for lumps and sores, make sure the condom is on, and let your inner beast free.</p>\n<p>His: It’s rare to hear people say, “thank god for what I did last night” after a sloppy hookup in I.V. Don’t ruin your reputation over a drunken, possibly infectious and probably terrible one-nighter. Unless you’re just out looking for a crazy night and sure that you won’t be leaving with any new diseases, I say keep it safely stowed. That is, of course, unless you’re 2 Chainz.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: There’s a reason why you two broke up in the first place. Hold firm and demand some respect for yourself; there are plenty of other (better) fish in the sea. Unless you both have engaged in major self-improvement, chances are that if the relationship didn’t work the first time, it won’t work the second. But if you’re not trying to get back at what you let go and all you want is a thrustin’ thrill, just keep in mind that he’s filling you now, but he don’t fulfill you.</p>\n<p>His: Think of yourself and your ex as pieces of silly putty. No matter how many times you separate, as soon as you touch each other new strings of connected putty are going to try to hold you two together. Unless you definitely want to get back together, or you love a dramatic lifestyle, don’t mix your putty with putties of the past.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Best Friends’ Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: I see no problem in this. If you’ve got the feels for your homie’s ex — and these are real feels, mind you — then go for it. Communicate with your bestie, gauge her reactions, be sensitive toward her thoughts and if the green’s a-go, you press that gas pedal. As they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. It wouldn’t be fair to discriminate against the treasure based on who it first belonged to, now would it?</p>\n<p>His: If you’ve got an itch that nothing but your best friend‘s ex can scratch, talk to your friend, think about the awkwardness and finally consider the fact that your best friend spent a good deal of time riding that very same rollercoaster that you’re now waiting in line for. Hopefully by the time you’ve pondered these things, you’ll have realized that it is just a god-awful idea. If you’re still like “Meh, I bet it’d be just fine,” you’re ignorant. Don’t be stupid.</p>\n<p><em>R. Pengsta and E.

This approach remains a sore subject for me, which is why I think it’s important to take a closer look at how people come to adopt the binary-driven concepts that color our generation’s zeitgeist. I often wonder how people look at the sheer complexity of our world and see any sort of binary. How people are presented with the vast proverbial “gray area” that permeates our Earth, the almost complete lack of “black and white” answers to anything, and still manage to exhibit racism, homophobia, transphobia or what have you, is a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>In fact, the more I study biology, the more I see this “proverbial grayness” present itself in the very building blocks that make up what we know about life. Nothing in biology (at least that I’ve studied so far) amounts to a pure black and white dichotomy. Nothing I’ve studied — from gene interactions to protein-binding events and metabolic pathways — has ever seemed to be a “one or the other” sort of interaction. Individual proteins bind fleetingly fast and at varying strengths; gene regulations occur at tiny timescales and regulate miniscule protein concentrations according to a vast array of environmental factors; metabolic pathways can involve hundreds, if not thousands, of intermediate molecules whose individual concentrations are controlled highly effectively in tandem, and again, at ridiculously small timescales. Thousands of chemical interactions within the body are paired with a thousand more, and those thousands are coupled with yet more. The body is in constant flux, and during development there are so many factors that affect how an organism will grow, learn and interact with the world around it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In light of life’s complexities, it’s shocking that anybody would think so deterministically about anything regarding human psychology. Sexuality and the huge variance that can be seen in human sexual preferences are both results of the intricacy of human development.</p>\n<p>As small children we are constantly told that everyone is a unique and special snowflake and that no two people in the world are ever exactly the same. Well, if everyone is as special and unique as they say, then it really shouldn’t be surprising that the special snowflake you met at that party last weekend can only reach orgasm if she licks another snowflake’s eyeball at climax (it’s called “oculingus,” look it up). If you’ve never heard of oculingus, it’s likely because uncommon and “weird” sexualities get swept under the rug. Just as we don’t berate people for liking the color pink, we shouldn’t make pariahs out of people who do things in the bedroom that we’ve never heard of.</p>\n<p>In researching for my articles I spend all too much time on the internet, and in doing so, I get to read a whole lot of sex columns and bedroom horror stories. Now, reading sex stories from strangers on the internet certainly doesn’t give me a Ph.D. in developmental psychology, nor does it make me a “sexpert.” But it does give me just enough perspective to realize that the variance between peoples’ sex lives and tastes is not only fascinating but beautiful and should be free to be explored by all.</p>\n<p>I’m not a neurobiologist (yet) but in the humble opinion of this biology student-turned-opinion writer, it will be through the study and understanding of neural development that we will ultimately come to know just how complex we are as humans.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration’s decision to invest in the mapping of the human connectome, a feat dubbed “The next great American project,” is sure to yield many answers to fundamental questions about the brain. I think one of these fundamental answers will concern the origin of human sexuality. Ultimately, though, what a roadmap of the human brain will show us is that there are so many different paths to reach the end goal of becoming a grown human being. Thus the idea of treating someone differently because they have sex with other dudes, like dressing in drag or play to a different gender than their physical appearance suggests will seem ludicrous.</p>\n<p>I like to end with calls to action, so I encourage you all to do two things. First, don’t be afraid to explore your own sexualities. Second, don’t be afraid to explore other peoples’, either. You might think it’s weird at first, but when your new partner asks you to lower yourself into that swing for the first time, please don’t forget the ball-gag.</p>\n<p><em>Luc Gendrot embraces, never erases, his computer’s browsing history.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the Wednesday, April 17, 2012 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This means saying what you like, how you like it, when you like it, where you like it and not being afraid to be the initiator and get specific with your boy.</p>\n<p>Sexy-sneak-attack him next time he walks in the door: put on some of his favorite lingerie, tackle him onto your bed (counter, table, couch, floor — the list goes on), proceed to take off said lingerie and then do all those things that you said you’d save for his birthday. He’ll be living the dream, and I bet you he’ll do his best to make sure you feel the same.</p>\n<p>Then, when it’s his turn, tell him if all he’s doing is bouncing around like a kid in a Jolly Jump. I promise you that it’s better to say in the moment, “That’s not doing anything for me; put your back into it.” If you wait for him to look up one time and see you staring blank-faced at the clock, counting minutes while he’s busy thinking he’s blowing your mind (sore subject), you’re only losing out on your own pleasure and destroying his manhood.</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to say is you need to be completely naked in each sense of the word every time you show up to play with your man, or it will definitely be embarrassing for one of you, probably him. A combination of insecurity and shame does not make a night one to remember, for the right reasons at least.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Bring Beer.</p>\n<p>Although beer is the golden blood of happiness and does actually make the world go round, I don’t mean that you can make him happy just by bringing him beer (certainly helps, though). On this one I mean you need to think about what you bring to the table when push comes to shove. If you’re not doing the pushing or the shoving, you need to seriously reevaluate your sexual tactics.</p>\n<p>Basically, take into consideration that guys need to feel like they’re being taken care of — not babied, but taken care of.</p>\n<p>Part 3: Batman.</p>\n<p>Remember his fantasies. Chances are that your man is not Christian Grey and does not dream of tying you to a telephone post while using some medieval torture device to get off. However, if Mr. Grey is actually your man, then please disregard this section.</p>\n<p>Every single boy has dreams of different freaky ways he wishes he could get it on and most of them are harmless and exciting. The problem is that far too often, these fantasies are disregarded because the act itself is “good enough.” I’m here to tell you that if you let him wear his Batman mask and talk in the Dark Knight’s voice as he explores your Batcave with his Batmobile, you will have given that man a memory to be cherished until the end of time.</p>\n<p>All I want to say on this one is, take his fantasies into consideration next time you are trying to enjoy yourselves, and I’m sure he’ll remember it the next time he has the opportunity to return the favor.</p>\n<p>Men are not impossible to figure out; take care of them and they’ll take care of you.</p>\n<p><em>E.

There’s a damn good chance someone is going to see your ass bobbing up and down in the lewdest of ways. You’re at your most vulnerable, naked and writhing, and the possibility that you could be reprimanded is high. The adrenaline is intoxicating. Not only that, but I adore the spontaneity of it: your partner can’t wait to get home to mash your nasties together and simply must have you on the grass, right here, right now. That hunger, that deviousness, that breathless giggling — these are the most delicious aspects of public sex. However, like all adrenaline-inducing activities, it’s always good to have a game plan. So, below, I entail my recommendations for your racy romp, particularly focusing on locale, with other kernels of knowledge littered throughout.</p>\n<p>Finding a proper place is perhaps the most important and trying aspect of sex away from home. It has to be an appropriate balance of being risky and concealed. “If you are for sure going to be caught, that’s scary. I doubt I could get it up. But with a little bit of risk, that’s fun,” said one lewd friend to another. I do not recommend the beach. Sure, it sounds romantic, but do you really want sand in your crevices? Just imagine a handful of tiny, salty rocks in your cooch. Sorry ladies, but that sand is not going to blossom into a beautiful pearl one day. That stuff will rub and chafe and cut as your partner pokes your insides. It can lead to infections, and it’s just not cute. What I think you really want from beach sex is to hear the crashing of the waves: que romantico.

Let the record show that if you do it in the bathroom where you can lock the doors (ahem, Dylan), it doesn’t count, and I decree your boning null and void. Well, save for the joy of insertion, props to that. It must be an open space, wherein anyone could see your moon-pale ass. Double points if you do it while watching the sunset over your partner’s wobbling shoulder (high-fives self).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Park:</p>\n<p>As I said, the beach is a cliché and can lead to some wicked chafing. Instead, try one of Isla Vista’s many poorly-lit parks. Maybe bring a blanket and “enjoy the cool night air.” Or, even better, the bluffs. Not only will it be private (in case the thought of being caught makes you too nervous to perform) but you can listen to the waves intermingle with your partner’s erratic breathing. Let me just add, however, that a confidant of mine recommended not to do it on the bench by Window-to-the-Sea. You think it’s a good idea, but it’s not.</p>\n<p>The Roof:</p>\n<p>Specifically, the tops of school buildings. Similar to the thrill of library sex, you can make the double-backed beast atop the halls of academia with less of a risk and more of a note of novelty. This may be the top of the Life Sciences building, the top of HSSB or any other building that you can get-it-on-top-of.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more specific to my freshman frolickers, try behind San Miguetto, on the side facing Manzanita. Outside the stairway on that side of the building, there is a pocket blocked from external view that you can fiddle in. Just don’t all go at once. Crazy kids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Campus Point:</p>\n<p>Bitches love Campus Point.</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. thinks “private” parts are overrated; get ’er done like everybody could be watching.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 12 of the Wednesday, May 8, 2013 print edition of the <em>Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51240\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/call-of-the-wild-farewell-four-walls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51240\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/call-of-the-wild-farewell-four-walls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/call-of-the-wild-farewell-four-walls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/call-of-the-wild-farewell-four-walls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/call-of-the-wild-farewell-four-walls/","id":6347,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6346,6345,6344],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
