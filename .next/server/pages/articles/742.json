On the other hand, for many teammates who have grown up in NorCal, it’s their favorite road trip, as they get to see a lot of family members and friends who come out to support the team on the road. The bus ride up to Davis wasn’t too bad. It took us around five hours or so, but we went straight to practice off the bus without going to the hotel or anything first, which always sucks because we didn’t get time to just chill out for a little at the hotel. Our first game was against Davis, who has been struggling for much of the year. Our focus coming into the game was to work on execution and putting a team away once we have the lead. As far as the game goes, we played pretty well, moved the ball around the best we have all season long and ended up winning by around 30. The next day we drove to Pacific and had a light practice, just going over our game plan and getting loosened up a little. The game was at 5 o’clock because it was on TV up in that area and it was nice having a game at 5 o’clock so we weren’t just sitting around the hotel all day waiting for game time. The game against Pacific was a bit tougher than the game against Davis and it got close at the end when we didn’t execute as well as we should have, but we got the win and that’s what’s most important. For those who are from NorCal it was nice because we then had the night to spend with family and friends until our curfew that night. My least favorite part of this particular road trip has always been the drive home because we get up on Sunday and spend the majority of the day sitting in a stuffy bus driving along with absolutely nothing to look at with the smell of hundreds of cows. It ended up taking us around six hours to get home on Sunday and by the time we got home our day was pretty much shot and almost everyone had homework that needed to be done before class on Monday. Practice on Monday was good: short and to the point, which is always nice after a five-day road trip. Coming up we have Northridge and Fullerton, both teams we have already played and beaten, but now we play them on the road, which is always harder than home games.</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned for more from Christian and the UCSB men’s basketball team continues its conference play.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/","id":742,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[741,740,739],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson","biography":"Not available","articles":[739,742,750],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Ready For Awaiting Challenge in Anaheim","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The following is the latest installment of the Nexus Sports athlete blog series, featuring Chrisitan Peterson, a senior forward on the men’s basketball team.   So after a great senior night and...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>The following is the latest installment of the Nexus Sports athlete blog series, featuring Chrisitan Peterson, a senior forward on the men’s basketball team.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So after a great senior night and closing out league at 12-4, we are now headed down to Anaheim for the Big West tourney as the number three seed. Fullerton is the number two seed after their win over Long Beach but second or third seed doesn’t make much difference because we would still play each other before the championship game. Senior night was great. Probably the most fun I’ve had playing in a game my entire career here at UCSB. We had a substantial lead the entire game and that allowed us to play more relaxed and have fun with each other more. This next weekend can either make or break our season. The past two years we have upset Long Beach in the final to get the automatic bid to the NCAA tourney and we will have to do it again if we hope to make it back for a third consecutive year. We are starting to play some of the best basketball we have played all year long and it couldn’t be at a better time. Everything changes around tourney time. Attitudes become more focused, games become more physical and coaches will lose their shit easier. Beach crushed it in conference losing only their last game to Fullerton and they will be heavily favored to win it again. The bus we have for this road trip is epic. SB Airbus is testing out some new buses I guess and the one we’re on has leather seats and tables and is way more comfortable than their other dust-infested buses. Tomorrow we’re playing Pacific, who we played a week ago and beat at home. Although it is hard to beat a team three times, we are focused and ready to go. It’s hard to play three consecutive days in a row but that adds to the excitement of the whole tourney. I mean, it’s better than practicing, that’s for sure. Practice yesterday was good. Short but sweet and all I did was watch mostly after having surgery to reset my nose, which I broke last week in practice. Playing at the Honda Center is pretty fun. It’s a huge arena and you can feel the cool breeze on the court from the ice underneath it for the hockey rink. I’m looking forward to playing in my last Big West tourney and I feel the rest of the team is excited as well. Everyone is healthy and ready to go and bring home a third Big West tourney title in as many years.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/","id":739,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[738,737,736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One on One With James Nunnally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After another stellar season from guard James Nunnally, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the Big West Tournament this Thursday as the No. 3 overall seed.

I didn’t want that Second Team honor, I feel like I am First Team … It will just make be hungry going forward though; I’m motivated like crazy right now. I just want to prove to everybody and all the coaches that voted against me that they made the wrong choice.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally was voted Second Team All-Big West in 2009-10 and an Honorable Mention All-Big West last season. He averaged 15.9 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game this season, both career highs.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: After scoring 24 points on Senior Night last weekend, you moved into fourth place on the All-Time UCSB scoring list with 1,619 career points. Did you ever imagine this being possible when you came here as a freshman?</p>\n<p>JN: No, I never did. My first two games here I barely played — like 10 minutes a game. So I didn’t think that would be possible. Then I started to play more and more … at first it was looking rocky, but it’s been great since. … It’s pretty amazing looking back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: So after you went through your whole recruiting process, what led you to come to UCSB?</p>\n<p>JN: I didn’t really know too much about the university, then my coach back home that I was real close with — my brother’s junior college coach — he kind of was guiding me where to go. He told me, ‘It’s a good program; they are going to be bringing in a couple more freshmen to reboot the program.’ Then when I came on my visit and played with the guys, everyone was really cool, and the guys were accepting. They just sold me — it felt like the perfect fit.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally’s older brother, Michael, transferred to Pacific, where he and James played against each other multiple times.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You and Orlando Johnson came in here together four years ago. You guys were freshman roommates, are great friends and now are two of the top four leading scorers in school history. How has it been to accomplish all that you have alongside a great teammate and friend like OJ?</p>\n<p>JN: It’s unbelievable. When we came in, we just said we wanted to win and do things players had never done at this school. It’s just been really, really fun, man. I’m honored to play with OJ … playing with OJ has been special — if they double him, I’ll be open, if they double me, he’ll be open, and I find him. We just feed off each other; it’s a good chemistry we have.</p>\n<p><em>Orlando Johnson ranks first on the all-time UCSB scoring list with 1,754 career points.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: This year your overall game has evolved, as you seem to be more patient on offense. Was this a conscious effort by you to improve in certain areas?</p>\n<p>JN: I have definitely made a leap this year. It’s just all the hard work I put in over summer. One of my best friends, we watched film together and worked out all summer. I just worked on everything I need to work on, you know? My post-game, seeing the floor, change of speed — just everything. And it really helped me.</p>\n<p><em>Nunnally averaged a career high 2.6 assists per game this season.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: It was just announced that this season was the highest average attendance for the men’s basketball program in 17 years. What does it mean for the team on the court to have that kind of fan support at home?</p>\n<p>JN: Really?! Wow. That means a lot to us. We love to see the Gaucho Locos out there and all the fans from the community. It really helps us on the court; they are like the sixth man. I love playing against big crowds especially at home … it motivates us even more because we are doing it for the school and the community, and not just for ourselves.</p>\n<p><em>The Thunderdome drew an average crowd of 3,323 per game in 14 home games this season, the highest since 1995. Highlights were a sellout of 6,000 vs. Long Beach State on Jan. 21, and over 5,000 in back-to-back games vs. San Diego State and UNLV in November.RP: Off the court, what are your favorite things to do?</em></p>\n<p>JN: I just like to chill. I like to hang out, stay mellow … listen to music, hang out with my friends, watch sports all day. I like going to the beach if the weather is nice. I go and check out downtown SB a little bit. You know, just a little bit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Any pre-game rituals we should know about?</p>\n<p>JN: I just take a nap. I take like a 45-minute nap and then get in the shower, nothing too crazy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Kobe or LeBron?</p>\n<p>JN: Kobe. That’s my guy. Kobe is the one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What gets you fired up? Any trash talk?</p>\n<p>JN: I have a chip on my shoulder because people have overlooked me. I have the attitude like I’m the underdog. That’s the main thing that gets me going … when people start talking that gets me going too; that’s extra motivation. I don’t usually start the trash talk, but it will get me going.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: How many tattoos do you have?</p>\n<p>JN: I have about 17 tattoos.</p>\n<p>RP: Favorite one?</p>\n<p>JN: My favorite is the one on the left inside of my arm, of my mom’s name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What does the future hold for James Nunnally?</p>\n<p>JN: I’m definitely going to pursue my dream and try to get drafted or picked up in the NBA. That’s my number one priority. I feel like I’m an NBA player, and I feel like I can make it, and I feel like I am gonna make it … just gotta keep working hard and staying humble and hungry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: Do you have a favorite moment or memory from your four years here?</p>\n<p>JN: On the court, my favorite memory here was the chance to play against North Carolina in my freshman year. It was Hansborough’s first game back from injury, Ty Lawson, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington … that was a fun game in a fun atmosphere.</p>\n<p><em>North Carolina went on the win the National Championship that season. Nunnally had season-highs of 22 points and seven rebounds in the game. Hansborough, Lawson, Green and Ellington were all drafted to the NBA.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: What about off the court?</p>\n<p>JN: Off the court, I gotta go with Floatopia 2009. That was probably one of the funnest days ever.</p>\n<p>RP: Yeah that was epic, and we were lucky — we caught that last one as freshmen.</p>\n<p>JN: We did! We caught the last one. One of the best days ever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: You guys have won each of the last two Big West Tournament Championships, beating the No. 1 seed this year, Long Beach State, both times. Any predictions for the tournament this weekend?</p>\n<p>JN: No prediction — we are just going to play our hearts out. It’s win or go home now and as a senior, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RP: When you look back on your time spent here in Santa Barbara, how will those memories be?</p>\n<p>JN: My time here has had its ups and downs, and all in all I have loved it. I love SB — what it’s taught me, everything I’ve learned, all the people I’ve met and all the relationships I’ve had … this place and these years will always have a place in my heart, man.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nunnally and the rest of the Gauchos will face off against Pacific at noon on Thursday in the first round of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/james-nunnally/","id":740,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[739,738,737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Test Against Pacific in Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With momentum on its side and a Big West championship two games within reach, the UCSB women’s basketball team heads to the Honda Center to take on Pacific this afternoon.

The whole team was really disappointed, so we’re excited to play them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB earned their trip to the Honda Center after a come-from-behind victory at UC Irvine, in which the Gauchos allowed the Anteaters to score just 51 points, while on the offensive end, five players tallied at least eight points.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep our confidence up,” Zornig said. “We have to stick together as a team and keep playing how we’re playing. If we get it done on the defensive end, we’ll win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to maintain its tenacious league-leading defense, which allows teams 52 points per game, because the Tigers love to score. They average 68.1 points per game, second in the Big West, and feature three of the top 12 scorers in guards Kendall Rodriguez, Erica McKenzie and Gena Johnson. The three average 35.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it’s about us and we just have to do what we do best,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Pacific is also third in conference in three-point shooting, hitting 32.9 percent of its threes and averaging 6.4 treys a game.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a threat from behind the arc too: senior forward Kelsey Adrian. Adrian ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point shooting (36.9 percent) and knocked down crucial threes in the last game against Irvine.</p>\n<p>In both games against Pacific, UCSB faltered down the stretch, allowing the Tigers to go on large unanswered runs. The first matchup was played evenly until Pacific went on a 10-0 run to seal the game. The second game saw a terrible performance by the Gauchos. After going down early, UCSB closed the gap to single digits, but then watched Pacific mount a 18-0 run in the second half. UCSB had just 15 points in the second period.</p>\n<p>Despite the inconsistency this season, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has a better plan in mind that will make her team forget any loss and allow the two seniors to leave a great legacy.</p>\n<p>“When I knew realistically we were back in the corner as far as winning the conference this year and that’s what they came in here understanding as seniors, I [told them] that there would be no bigger legacy than being the surprise team, being the Cinderella story, winning the conference tournament, and having a chance to make a run at the NCAA’s,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/","id":741,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[740,739,738],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
