Clinic to further discuss potential services and funding that a Community Services District (CSD) would entail.</p>\n<p>Students, I.V. residents, university administrators and members of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors have been meeting weekly for the past several months to discuss Williams’s I.V. self-governance bill AB 3, which was introduced in December to establish I.V. as a CSD which can potentially levy taxes in order to provide residents certain infrastructure and services. Currently, the group is discussing the details of a potential I.V. CSD to fund graffiti removal, bluff fencing and other services.</p>\n<p>According to Esther Aguilera, Representative for Santa Barbara County Third District Doreen Farr, the county does not provide adequate funding for graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have money for graffiti abatement so every year what I do is go to UCSB for $2,000, go to the county for $2,000 and the property owners for $2,500,” Aguilera said. “This year the I.V. Property Association did not give us $2,500 so I had to find somewhere that amount. Every year we have to go through this process. The county is not set up to do graffiti abatement.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera said while the county does partially fund graffiti abatement services for I.V., funding is not guaranteed in the future.</p>\n<p>“You have someone in the third district who actively is asking for money and that’s how graffiti is being taken care of, but when the third district supervisor is no longer there, it’s going to be a problem,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<p>According to second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, the county does not have adequate funding mechanisms in place to provide much needed fencing for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it kind of shows some of the pitfalls of the [county] services,” Minoiefar said. “In the part that says ‘sexual assaults and riots,’ maybe mention cliff falls and things like that. … We can’t even keep people from falling from the cliffs.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera also said the addition of bluff-side fencing around parks on Del Playa Drive should be included into the jurisdiction of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“What about adding fence maintenance as one of the powers? And then you would have control of that fence,” Aguilera said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61298\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61298\" data-attachment-id=\"61298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/das-williams_brendan-mansfield-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"T J Carmody\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424816365\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61298\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2-683x1024.jpg?resize=327%2C491\" alt=\"(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"327\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Das-Williams_Brendan-Mansfield-2.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould said the county should remain responsible for funding maintenance of the fences.</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to take that on,” Gould said. “IVRPD owns some of the parks. The county owns the rest of them and they’re responsible for paying for that. There’s no reason we should be absorbing that.”</p>\n<p>According to community organizer with Williams’ office Darcel Elliott, the ideas stakeholders brainstormed at the meeting will be used to flesh out the specifics of AB 3 in the near future.</p>\n<p>“This is just placeholder language to get into committee right now,” Elliott said. “This isn’t the big enchilada. This would never pass out of committee because there is no funding mechanism to provide all these services. This is so that we can keep the bill alive.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and IVRPD board member Paola De La Cruz said she is concerned about the proposed utility users tax, which would charge I.V. residents a percentage of their utility bills to fund services and could affect small households.</p>\n<p>“I live with one roommate. There’s only two of us but there is no gas; we only pay electricity,” De La Cruz said. “Our bill is a high amount, usually about $150 for electricity. The amount of money we would be paying compared to another house with five students is going to be higher.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the goal of the proposed utility user tax is to create a tax that is fairly distributed.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are having this discussion is to put the burden most fairly on the most amount of people,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board member Pegeen Soutar said a per-bedroom tax is preferable to a utility users tax to fairly divide the payment of local taxes.</p>\n<p>“Parks and Rec has a bedroom tax and that’s the majority of our funding, and it’s $94 a year, and that’s down by a two-thirds vote by taxpayers in the community,” Soutar said. “The landowners pay it, but in all reality that’s passed on by rent. I look at that as a very equitable way to place a tax.”</p>\n<p>According to De La Cruz, the stakeholders’ town hall meeting held last Saturday in Anisq’oyo’ Park was successful in including more students in the process of discussing self-governance.</p>\n<p>“I loved having it at the park,” De La Cruz said. “I saw some people I think were students just walking by and sitting out on the small hill just listening to conversations that were happening. I wish we would have had time for actual discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61313\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61313\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/stakeholders-talk-graffiti-fences/","id":4740,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4739,4738,4737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Travel to No. 12 USC Seeking Season Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"No. 12 UCSB will look to take down No. 8 USC for the second time this season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62075\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015.04.02-StephenManga-Baseball-1-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2077158269\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62097\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62075\" data-attachment-id=\"62075\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-07/gauchos-travel-to-no-12-usc-seeking-season-sweep/freshman-clay-fisher-bunts-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015.04.02-StephenManga-Baseball-1-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Stephen Manga\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Freshman Clay Fisher bunts.

Adding yesterday to the books, the Trojans are now 25-7 overall.</p>\n<p>Going scoreless for five innings, the game was finally knocked open in the top of the sixth off a one-run RBI from senior second baseman Peter Marris, followed by another single RBI from freshman infielder Kyle Plantier.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Heading into this weekend with a seven-game win streak, the Gauchos low-scoring defensive battle with the Trojans started with junior lefty Domenic Mazza, who pitched for his fourth win of the season and his second over USC. Mazza pitched through seven innings and allowed four hits and no runs while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Handing the ball to freshman righty setup man Alex Garcia, Mazza was relieved from the game due to a possible appearance from the bullpen this weekend.</p>\n<p>Garcia allowed the only Trojan run of the night in one inning pitched before passing the baton to junior righty Robby Nesovic, who tossed his third save in a one-inning appearance.</p>\n<p>The consistently high-performing Gaucho fielding had a few ups and downs. The team suffered through a few infield bobbles recorded for two errors, but redshirt senior right fielder Luke Swenson came out strong in the outfield.</p>\n<p>Swenson put up two outstanding catches, one which laid him out on the grass for a diving snag and the other sent him into the right field wall – both saving RBI hits.</p>\n<p>Only six Trojan and five Gaucho hits were allowed all game from opposing pitching staffs. Sophomore Jeff Paschke started for USC and went through two innings before leaving it to sophomore lefty Bernardo Flores to finish the remained of the starting half.</p>\n<p>Junior lefty Marc Huberman made a one-inning appearance for the Trojans allowing no hits and striking out one. USC pitchers struck out a total of nine, compared to UCSB’s seven total strikeouts.</p>\n<p>This was the first time all season the Trojans has outhit their opponent but not won the game. Though big USC hitter junior right fielder Bobby Stahel went 2-4, he came up with no RBI for the night.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road trip this weekend at Northridge to battle the Matadors in the Gauchos’ second conference series of the season starting Friday at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/two-run-sixth-inning-helps-no-11-ucsb-edge-no-6-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/two-run-sixth-inning-helps-no-11-ucsb-edge-no-6-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/two-run-sixth-inning-helps-no-11-ucsb-edge-no-6-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/two-run-sixth-inning-helps-no-11-ucsb-edge-no-6-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/two-run-sixth-inning-helps-no-11-ucsb-edge-no-6-usc/","id":4738,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4737,4736,4735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

First Friday planners were initially organizing a larger-than-average version of the event with multiple stages but ran into issues once Santa Barbara County approved noise ordinances during the first two weekends of April in order to prevent this year’s Deltopia from becoming disorderly. I.V. First Friday is coordinated by I.V. Open Lab, a project-based course offered by the university’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and sponsored by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) and the I.V. Food Co-Op. The event is hosted as a late-night alternative to what many students call the “I.V. party scene,” and is held the first Friday of every month at Perfect Park, featuring live local music, artwork, improvisation and dance performances and more.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, the original plan for the First Friday on April 3 was to have a number of groups and organizations co-host a block party that would have been larger than most First Fridays to date.</p>\n<p>“We were actually considering fencing off the entire end of the loop and having multiple stages with varying forms of entertainment operating simultaneously,” Gould said in an email. “Before we got very far into the planning, we realized we couldn’t proceed due to the festival ordinance that was put into place for Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Gould said the original proposal for I.V. First Friday was suggested in anticipation of the influx of people expected to come to I.V. during Deltopia weekend, which attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers in last April. </p>\n<p>“We figured that there would be a lot of people in town that night,” Gould said in an email. “The University has planned a lot of things Saturday as alternatives, but there was nothing on Friday, so we thought this might take some of the burden off the Del Playa partying.”</p>\n<p>Gould said I.V. Open Lab is now exploring the possibility of having an art show in the early evening of April 3 at the I.V. Clinic building that would feature I.V.’s “hidden art community.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of resident artists in Isla Vista that people just don’t know about that have been here for years, so we thought it would be kind of fun to showcase that,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the students of I.V. Open Lab are also discussing organizing a silent movie series and a silent disco, though the plans for the First Friday to be held on April 3 are still dependent on approval from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out a mellow, outdoor lounge-like event for that Friday,” Yasuda said. “We also want it to be local, so that’s why we’re showcasing the resident artists’ artwork. The visual display is quiet, the disco is quiet and then we thought about silent movies.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and I.V. Open Lab student Itxy Quintanilla said it was disappointing to learn the initial plans for the First Friday on April 3 could not be executed.</p>\n<p>“We are saving those plans for a future month,” Quintanilla said in an email. “We understand the reason for the implementation of these ordinances, but it has been difficult to work around them.”</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said she is hopeful the newly proposed events will be approved by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“After throwing around several ideas and discussing the ordinances, we hope that our movie in the park proposal will meet the guidelines and provide a safe and engaging community gathering,” Quintanilla said in an email. “Hopefully our plans are approved in order to create another successful event.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said the collaboration between students, faculty, residents and local businesses is what makes First Fridays special, and she hopes the First Friday scheduled for the night of April 3 can still take place.</p>\n<p>“We want it to happen and we think it’s going to be great and attract the right kind of people,” Yasuda said. “We feel it is really important to have programming that is creative, safe and alternative, because if you have nothing, then that’s when the trouble starts.” Yasuda said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/","id":4739,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4738,4737,4736],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
