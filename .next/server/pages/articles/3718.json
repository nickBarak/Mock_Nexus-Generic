According to Fischer, students and long-term residents complained about the bench’s constant occupation, noting that it deteriorated the curb appeal of the intersection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the bench was removed and broken into “a whole bunch of pieces,” according to Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould. Following the removal of the bench, Gould said the Public Works Department approached the IVRPD, asking if they would like to keep the pieces.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had an offer to receive all these slabs of stone and big boulders and we said, ‘Yes, please, we’ll take them,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD had the Public Works Department deliver the pieces to the Sueno Bark Park, where they plan to permanently keep the benches after they are rebuilt, according to Gould. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD plans to “reconstruct [the bench] into two, probably three separate smaller benches,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is currently no plan to have an unveiling for the new benches, Gould said the IVRPD plans to have them finished before May 18, the day of their planned “Bark Party” at the Sueno Bark Park. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On May 18, we’re having an event in the dog park called ‘Bark Party.’ We’ve got ‘Care For Paws’ out there doing free or discounted immunizations for dogs and Pet Smart’s giving away coupons and stuff. Humane Society will be there [and] Goleta Animal Pet Hospital will be giving away free coupons for services,” Gould said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then we’re going to have the best dog trick contest and the owner-pet look alike contest and musical chairs, dog version.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

For example, dispensaries must be at least 600 feet from any school (K-12), daycare or youth center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams speculated I.V. would receive a recreational dispensary, but the location must be precise due to youth centers like UCSB’s Children’s Center and I.V. Elementary School.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have more plans for retail, we are just trying to figure out how that’s going to work,” Lavagnino said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People still have really strong feelings about it, it’s like navigating a public minefield,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballotpedia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 57 percent of Californians voted yes to Prop 64 in 2016, which allowed recreational marijuana use for those over the age of 21. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Legalizing marijuana is more ethical than buying it off the black market,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federally, marijuana is still </span><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">classified</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is addictive with no medical value. This places it in the same category as cocaine and methamphetamines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A regime which uplifts, reforms and permits the best of the operations and crushes the worst is what we want. The potential of hurting the cartel with legalization is something really powerful,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s all about tracking and trace of custody, we want people to know where their marijuana will be coming from.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continued to discuss how a retail store is much safer than many of the commonly offered marijuana delivery services, because they can be regulated and tracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are some things that are really bad about marijuana. For example, it affects your level of motivation. But compared to other medications like opiates, there is no comparison,” Williams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the drug becomes progressively more available, Williams and Lavagnino suspect that a lot of marijuana’s negative stigma will begin to fade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll just take time and exposure,” Lavagnino said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/sb-supervisors-and-young-democrats-discuss-lack-of-recreational-dispensaries/","id":3715,"author":{"id":254,"name":"Cristian Loza"},"related":[3714,3713,3712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Original estimations of tax revenue were $777,000, but according to estimated actuals — what was actually raised this fiscal year — the district will only receive $691,003 this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, also known as Measure R, was affirmed by voters <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/#search\">June 2018</a>, and a delay in its implementation led to fewer total funds than original estimations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the greater amount of funding for the 2019-2020 year, I.V. CSD also plans to increase spending dramatically compared to the current fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the I.V. CSD proposed spending $830,000 and is actually projected to spend $481,813.70 by the end of the fiscal year on June 30. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Projected spending for the 2019-2020 fiscal year totals $1,105,900.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funds will primarily be split between operations and community programs, with additional funding going toward safety, public works/graffiti abatement, housing and parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district held a public forum on April 16 for community members to speak about the budget, which Board Member Ethan Bertrand said played into the decision-making process about money allocation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like to thank the many community members who participated in the budget process for providing valuable feedback about how we can best serve the community,” Bertrand said in a message to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year’s budget continues to invest in public safety services, youth and family services, beautification and infrastructure improvements, rental housing mediation, and more,” Bertrand said in the message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This budget provides funding for the operation of the Isla Vista Community Center, which is expected to open in the next 6 months. The budget also fully funds the District’s sexual assault/interpersonal violence investigation and prevention program, the Isla Vista Safety Station program, graffiti abatement [and] services for community members experiencing homelessness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More will be spent on salaries and employee benefits this year as well. $215,800 is allocated for employees, compared to $186,800 this past fiscal year. Only $67,384.95 of that money was actually spent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the community programs budget is in professional and special services and contractual services, which both allotted for similar funds compared to the current fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the 2018-2019 fiscal year for I.V. CSD comes to a close in June, there remains $416,523.10 left unspent from the year alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to General Manager Jonathan Abboud, all unspent funds from the year will go toward building <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2-miRWadkTvXLYas6VZ5IghMSqO8nq7/view?fbclid=IwAR0msSTA6a6RbepW6ZuYus8M8Nm0BzaheHrIirxhhns0F20ppRJUUH2uzC4\">CSD reserves</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes short- and long-term cash reserves for regular operations, a capital maintenance fund to support community center equipment and repairs, a self-insurance fund and a capital outlay fund for future large scale public infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, I.V.

Bluffs Report released in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposed changes to the I.V. Bluff Policy follow an instance in which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\">15 feet of the cliff between 6653 and 6663 Del Playa Drive collapsed</a> in a short period in January 2017, according to the report. This collapse forced out 28 residents from the surrounding properties after a portion of the balcony crumbled off the cliff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This “single-event failure” — an event where the most cliff erosion occurs in a single point in time, as opposed to erosion over time — exceeded the current requirement of five feet and “raised concern regarding the current policy for structure setbacks, which includes an assumption that a single bluff failure will be no more than five feet,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all properties would be affected by the new proposal, Abolhoda noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to site-specific conditions of property, the threshold distance can be different for each property, depending on the type of foundation of the building, how close the building is to the property line and how close the south side of the building is to the cliff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property owners would be able to submit geotechnical evaluation reports to sidestep having to make renovations or cutbacks to the building, so long as the building meets the division’s requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we know that site-to-site situations can vary, we are asking that property owners hire a geotechnical engineer to evaluate their specific condition and let us know,” Abolhoda said. “[They can then] offer us a geotechnical report if they believe the 15 feet that would be the basis of our new policy is not really applicable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we get that report, we get other geotechnical engineers to review it and see if it’s acceptable, and if it’s acceptable then the policy would be based on a single event that is going to happen in that specific site. That’s how our policies are being revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with shallow foundations, about 24 to 32 inches deep, would be less likely to meet the division’s building safety requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings with caisson foundations in good shape have a better chance of sliding by the new policy, but a “series of triggers” would be established to monitor the integrity of the foundation and the safety of the building over time. The triggers would designate points in erosion which would render the support structures ineffective and require property owners to address the conditions of the building at that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building is less than 15 feet from the bluff, the property would be placed on a watch list to be “monitored on a continuing basis for bluff retreat and building proximity,” according to the report. The property owners would also be notified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can adjust our policy according to what is considered the most prevalent single-event failure that can be experienced on that site,” Abolhoda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a building comes within 10 feet of the bluff, the property owner will be issued an official “Notice of Violation” and will be required to address the “noncompliant conditions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing is done to address the threshold violation, the property owner would be fined and receive a “Notice of Non-Compliance,” according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the event that a building  comes within five feet of the bluff, the property owner may be issued a “Notice and Order to Vacate Building and Abate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is determined that the property does not meet the safety threshold, the property owner has several options.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The owner can “cut the building back a minimum of 30 feet,” but would also be allowed to do smaller cutbacks on a “case-by-case basis.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They could also maintain the building in its current condition if a geotechnical engineering report proves the building is safe to live in. Property owners would still need a “monitoring and abatement plan” prepared by a civil or structural engineer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third option is foundation strengthening, which could also allow property owners to maintain the existing structure through the “underpinning of shallow foundations,” anchoring of existing foundations or other methods, according to the report. Property owners would need reports from geotechnical and structural engineers to oversee the modifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building and safety division is holding a meeting with property owners on May 2 at the planning commission room on 123 E Anapamu Street to discuss concerns and “have a discussion about moving forward with new policy,” Abolhoda said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not rushing to this, and we want everyone to understand what we are asking, and we do not want to create a false panic,” Abolhoda said. “Safety is the primary reason for this change of policy.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
