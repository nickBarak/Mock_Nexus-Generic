The 21-year-old was eager to go into the coaching profession soon after he graduated, but he didn’t know where to start, so he called around waiting for his opportunity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Williams would go on to put together a wonderful program over his 19-year tenure, becoming the winningest coach in UCSB history, registering a record of 313-260 while bringing home three Big West Championships, three NCAA appearances and three Big West Coach of the Year awards.</p>\n<p>However, all good things must come to an end. After an abysmal 6-22 record, which included a 4-12 conference record and a last-place finish in the Big West, the Gauchos were forced to move on to something new.</p>\n<p>And just as Williams was brought in to revamp a program that was going through some struggles, a young 39-year-old associate head coach from the University of Arizona was hired and introduced on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, to bring glory back to UCSB basketball.</p>\n<p>Over that same span, Pasternack built a solid resume of coaching gigs, ranging from being an assistant at Cal from 2000-2007 to being the youngest Head Coach in college basketball at age 30 when he took over for the University of New Orleans to his latest job at Arizona.</p>\n<p>All that coaching, all that stress, all that fun came to fruition on that fateful Tuesday when he was given the keys to a program he called a “sleeping giant” on Gaucho alum Jim Rome’s radio show the day of his introduction.</p>\n<p>Despite taking over a program that did put forth some of its worst basketball in decades in terms of record — with the aforementioned 6-22 overall record and missing the Big West tournament for the first time since 1998 — the New Orleans native is not afraid to come into UCSB and put his name and stamp on this institution’s basketball program.</p>\n<p>“I think with any program, culture is the number-one priority, and culture isn’t just something you write on a piece of paper or put on a wall,” Pasternack said. “It’s your process on a daily basis and how you structure your workouts and hold yourselves accountable and taking advantage of all opportunities UC Santa Barbara has to offer.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things that are known about Santa Barbara is not only the beaches and beauty but the brains behind a school that ranks among the top public universities in the nation — something that coach Pasternack values and beliefs will be a big factor in the rebuilding of the basketball program.</p>\n<p>“To take advantage of getting an incredible education here and to graduate and be set up for the rest of your life, that’s part of the culture we want to instill here,” Pasternack said. “We plan on honoring the process, and honoring the process isn’t about the results but what it takes to get the results on a daily basis. We don’t want to just be Big West Champions; we want to be champions in all facets.”</p>\n<p>Not many coaches have had the track record Pasternack has been able to attain in such a short amount of time. The Indiana alum is set to turn 40 on April 15, yet he has already received great tutelage under Knight, a winner of over 900 college basketball games, the second most in NCAA Division I history, and Sean Miller, the current coach at Arizona who has made three Elite Eight appearances, six Sweet 16 appearances and has brought home two Pac-12 Championships.</p>\n<p>“The past six years at Arizona under Sean, who is a future Hall of Fame coach, and learning his system and being able to put together all the information I’ve learned over the past 20 years and picking out what I want to do best with my personality for our system to fit our personnel has been invaluable,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>Along with that, Pasternack also has the advantage of this being his second head coaching job. While at New Orleans, Pasternack often struggled, amassing only a 38-54 overall record in four seasons; however, it should be noted that Pasternack was facing many problems during his tenure there, as he was helping rebuild a team that was affected by Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited that I did have that opportunity in New Orleans,” Pasternack said. “I was 30 years old and I made a million mistakes as a young coach, and that is really helping me today in putting together a program, building a staff and managing a team the right way.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons Pasternack was such a sought-after coach was because of his recruiting experience.</p>\n<p>While at Arizona the past six seasons, Pasternack helped land the Wildcats a top-10 recruiting class, including a top-five recruiting class in four of those six years and was ranked as the 12th best recruiter in college basketball by ESPN last fall.</p>\n<p>The former Cal assistant has built many different connections over the last 18 years, including many different international connects that have helped him land great players such as Lauri Markkanen who declared for the NBA draft after a wonderful freshman year this past season attaining First Team All Pac-12 after averaging 15.6 points per game and 7.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are in need of some young talent that can come in and contribute right away, considering junior guard Gabe Vincent will most likely still not be ready for the start of next year and losing senior guard Eric Childress to graduation.</p>\n<p>“Recruiting has been great so far,” Pasternack said. “We are receiving an incredible amount of interest from transfers, California kids, international guys and me being able to use my connections I’ve built over 18 years is really paying dividends right now.”</p>\n<p>As a mid-major, part of UCSB’s road to success will be to build a very valuable home crowd, something that has dwindled over the last few years.</p>\n<p>A stadium that holds 5,600 people, the Thunderdome only averaged 1,587 seats filled per home game, with the highest crowd being against rival Cal Poly, a game UCSB won, which had 3,306 people in attendance.</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence that teams with large home crowds tend to do the best, especially when it comes to conference play.</p>\n<p>Pasternack wants to bolster this through the team’s rebuilding and would be aided by having a strong non-conference schedule to have the crowd constantly anxious throughout the season, and not just when the Mustangs come to town.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of games that have already been scheduled, even before I got here, but we want to bring an exciting game to the Thunderdome. Personally, I want to dive head first with the students, it is my number one priority to be available to the students,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>“I want to go on-campus, hand out the free tickets and get to know them because our success is tied to their interest in our program. The best mid-majors in the country have dominant home courts, their students are a huge part of why they win, and I want to figure out what we can do to make this a great home court environment.”</p>\n<p>It is clear one of Pasternack’s priorities is the rebuilding of this program. But he, like most adults, also has other priorities that keep him busy like having a family. Pasternack is a father to two kids, one boy, and one girl, who he loves very much. They are his fun, and they are his go-to during his free time. His son Joe IV loves basketball just like his father, while his daughter, Lilly, currently enjoys gymnastics.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76631\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76631\" data-attachment-id=\"76631\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/pasternack-aims-to-wake-sleeping-giant/mbball_pressconf_jorgemercado_img_6139/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=1088%2C1632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1088,1632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76631\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139-683x1024.jpg?resize=291%2C437\" alt=\"\" width=\"291\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MBBall_PressConf_JorgeMercado_IMG_6139.jpg?w=1088&amp;ssl=1 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joe Pasternack poses with his family during a press conference. <em>Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I don’t have a lot of interests,” Pasternack chuckles. “My life is basketball and my family.

The Aggies move into a three-way tie for third place, improving to 9-11 overall and 4-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With a struggling team, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell changed the starting lineup, benching two of her three seniors and instead starting three freshmen, a sophomore and Zornig. The move worked as the Gauchos jumped out to an early 20-9 lead.</p>\n<p>“We just had to mix it up and I was going with effort,” Mitchell said. “It’s obvious what we’ve been doing so far hasn’t worked and we just wanted energy to start the game.”</p>\n<p>However, Davis responded, picking up its defensive intensity by switching into its trapping defense and offensively taking advantage of its size down low. The Aggies stormed back to take a one-point lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second half, Santa Barbara came out flat once again. Three-point shots sparked a 7-0 fun for Davis, giving the Aggies a comfortable lead. In the second half, UCD shot 41.7 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have a lot of weapons on their team,” Zornig said. “They have good post players inside and then a lot of them can knock down the three. That’s their game and we knew that.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the second half, UCSB found ways to cut the lead to five or six points several times, but could never come up with the defensive stop needed to get within one possession.</p>\n<p>“At that point, it’s more mental than anything. You can’t trade baskets, especially when you’re down,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “There were a couple times where we would get a stop, we’d go down and score and then miss a box out or something like that. I know we had a couple of key mental mistakes in the second half and things like that cost you games.”</p>\n<p>The biggest discrepancy came at the free throw line. The Aggies, the best free throw shooting team in the Big West, shot 31-36 from the charity stripe while the Gauchos did not stand up to their second place ranking in conference, shooting just 18-29 from the line.</p>\n<p>“I’m not even going to spend the effort talking about their 36 attempts. It was our lack of knocking down the 29 attempts we had,” Mitchell said. “If you’re going to get that many attempts on the road, you have to focus. You win on the road by making layups, not turning the ball over and getting to the free throw line. We got there; we just didn’t knock them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis’ leading scorer, junior forward Sydnee Fipps, scored 21 points for Davis, but it was sophomore forward Alyson Doherty that killed UCSB and exploited its lack of height down low. Although averaging 11.7 points per game, Doherty exploded for a game-high 23 points on 7-11 shooting, including 9-12 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Nesbit led the team with 17 points while Zornig added 14 points and a team-high eight rebounds. In addition, in her first start in conference play, freshman forward Mi’Chael Wright finished the afternoon with nine points and seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Mi’Chael’s that blue-collar kid that is going to go after every rebound and that’s why we recruited her,” Mitchell said. “She stepped up tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home next week to take on Hawaii and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53824\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53824\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-02/gauchos-drop-third-straight-at-davis/","id":557,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[556,555,554],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Surge to First Place After Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB came up big with home victories against UC Irvine and UC Davis this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There were a number of prominent storylines this weekend for the UCSB men’s basketball team, ranging from a pair of decisive victories to junior center Alan Williams’ usual dominance down low. But perhaps the most compelling was the return of sophomore guard John Green playing in his first ever regular season game as a Gaucho despite this being his third year in the program.</p>\n<p>Green, who missed the past two seasons and the beginning of this year with broken foot bones, entered the game Saturday against UC Davis to a standing ovation from the crowd, logging his first meaningful minutes in a Gaucho uniform.</p>\n<p>“Emotionally, I get choked up. You’re talking about a kid that has waited three years to play in a regular season game and had four broken bones, and a kid that wants it as bad as anybody we have in the program,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “No one, and I’ve been here 16 years, no one has endured what he’s endured.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately after entering, Green grabbed a rebound and put it right back up for a basket en route to a two-point, three-rebound performance over seven minutes.</p>\n<p>The other headline Saturday in the Gauchos’ 82-67 victory over Davis was Big Al’s 27-point, 20-rebound performance, marking the first 20-20 game in UCSB history since 1990. Williams was a big reason Santa Barbara moved into first place with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 mark in the Big West. Davis now stands at 7-15 overall and 2-5 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I love the fact that he got 20 and 20. It says something about a guy if he can go get 20 and 20 in a game,” Coach Williams said. “That doesn’t happen very often. He’s already getting a lot of national attention but you get 20 and 20, that’s a feat.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished the first half with 10 points and 12 rebounds and followed that up with a 17-point, eight rebound performance in the second half. Big Al also finished the game with four assists and two blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“We go to him every game to see who can stop him because I don’t think anyone in division I basketball can stop him,” freshman point guard Eric Childress said.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 15 points on 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc, becoming only the third Gaucho to make 200 career three-pointers in the process.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 11 points for UCSB, while Childress added eight points and three assists. This game was never in question as the Gauchos outrebounded Davis by a margin of 14 and outshot the Aggies in both field goal and three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that we can run this conference and really be the number one team to win that Big West Championship,” Green said. “Once we have the opportunity to meet these two teams that we lost to [we’re confident] that we’re going to handle business.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest against UC Irvine began the weekend on a high note for the Gauchos, as they stomped the Anteaters in an 80-60 victory. Big Al led UCSB with 26 points and 10 rebounds despite having to go against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye who is all of 7’6” and 290 pounds.</p>\n<p>“We really came out very intense, excited to play and we definitely showed some stuff tonight,” Big Al said. “We showed our heart, we showed our aggressiveness and we showed our competitive edge out there. When we have that competitive edge and we play as hard as we did tonight we’re a tough team to beat.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taran Brown finished the game with 16 points and shot a perfect 5-5 from the three. Boswell scored 10 points off the bench, sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added eight points and six rebounds and junior point guard Zalmico Harmon contributed seven points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Following a Saturday victory at Cal Poly, Irvine now stands tied with UCSB for first with a 5-2 Big West record (14-9 overall).</p>\n<p>“We have guys that have really accepted their roles on this team and I think that we’re finally starting to see how good we can possibly be,” Big Al said. “Of course we have a lot of work to do, but when we all accept our roles and play our roles we’re a tough team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays Thursday at Hawai’i.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 3, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily

Williams is the winningest coach in UCSB history after compiling an overall record of 313-260 over his tenure and making three NCAA Tournament appearances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack was a big candidate for other Division I coaching vacancies, including Cal — where he served as assistant coach from 2000-07 — and for a job at UNC Wilmington, a team that is coming off a very successful 29-6 season and nearly upset a strong Virginia team in the NCAA tournament, but ultimately he decided to become the next coach in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite having big shoes to fill, Pasternack definitely seems like a worthy candidate to replace Williams. The Indiana University graduate is “known as a dogged recruiter who helped pull in many of UA’s California and international players,” according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tucson.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>In his six seasons spent at the University of Arizona, he helped land the Wildcats a top-10 recruiting class, including a top-five recruiting class in four of those six years. In September of last year, ESPN ranked him as the 12th best recruiter in college basketball after helping land the No. 1 prospect,DeAndre Ayton.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack is also known to have many international contacts to help with recruiting, which could be put to great use in the rebuilding of a UCSB program that is coming off its worst season in decades after finishing 6-22 and missing the Big West Tournament for the first time since 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack will be introduced at 2 p.m. on Tuesday at the ICA building.
