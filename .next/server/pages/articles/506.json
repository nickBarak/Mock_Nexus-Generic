It’s all or nothing now, the momentum we have from this game will hopefully roll over to the next.”</p>\n<p>In one of the game’s most critical moments, it was Jemerigbe’s made three-pointer with nearly six minutes left in the game that prevented a surging Cal Poly team from possibly completing a comeback.</p>\n<p>Along with Jemerigbe, both senior forward Mi’Chael Wright and senior center Melissa Maragnes were celebrated for Senior Night.</p>\n<p>Shifting the game in Santa Barbara’s advantage were runs to close the first half and open the second before Cal Poly embarked on its fourth quarter comeback, cutting the Gauchos lead to six before coming up short.</p>\n<p>It was a highly energized atmosphere inside the Thunderdome with conference tournament seeding at stake. Nonetheless, both teams traded baskets in reflection of the game’s intense pace.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead which included a basket by junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, who scored a game-high 24 points but could never establish any consistency as she shot 9-of-22 and 4-of-10 from long range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struck with a balanced attack, first going to redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman in the paint, then from behind the three-point line with redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter for a 5-4 lead. It was a start that led to a 15-3 run that before Lynn Leaupepe scored five-straight points to end the quarter as Cal Poly trailed 15-12.</p>\n<p>Porter continued to warm up from deep with two three-pointers in the first to minutes of the second quarter. The Gauchos’ shooter scored eight of the team’s first 10 points.</p>\n<p>It was Porter’s most productive period as she tallied 10 of her 13 points during the period, and ended the game 4-of-7 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Yet, tying the game at 25 apiece with a three-pointer was junior guard/forward Mary Kate Evans for her only field goal off the bench.</p>\n<p>The tie wouldn’t last long once UCSB put together its 12-3 run before halftime. Half of the Gauchos points were scored at the free-throw line. Also responsible for half of the points lodged was Jemerigbe as her two made free-throws handed UCSB a 37-28 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>With momentum already going UCSB’s way, the opening minutes of the third quarter belonged solely to the Gauchos as they constructed a 16-6 run.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch began with the draining of a three-pointer by Jemerigbe to give UCSB its first double-figure lead of the game at 40-30.</p>\n<p>Helping Cal Poly chip at the Gauchos’ lead was senior forward Hannah Gilbert as she scored seven points and went a perfect 3-of-3 from the field in the quarter. Overall, Gilbert shot 50 percent (5-of-10) and ended the game with 12 points, four rebounds, one block, and one steal.</p>\n<p>But Santa Barbara’s scoring outburst proved to be too much as its bench emerged as well. The combination of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler’s drive and kick ability along with freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez’ perimeter shooting helped run up the score on UCSB’s end.</p>\n<p>The two scored six apiece, and it was Hernandez’ made three-pointer at the 4:17 mark of the third that gave UCSB a 53-34 lead as it seemed destined to route its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>Toler finished with 15 points and a game-high seven assists, while Hernandez ended with six points.</p>\n<p>Despite its 19-point deficit, Cal Poly still showed signs trying to curtail UCSB’s growing lead. Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe complemented her sister’s scoring with seven-straight points during the third quarter but it would not be enough still. Her final results to the game were 16 points and five rebounds while going 7-of-16, 2-of-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s ability to hold the sisters to inefficient shooting nights was key in its defense holding Cal Poly to percentages of 38.5 from the field and 35 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“We held them to 40, they had 55 last time. Good heavens they’re good. There’s not much you can do with a midrange game,” Henrickson explained. “We tried to keep them on one side of the floor. [On Friday] we played some things live, which we don’t normally a lot. Every assistant had a stat. What are their numbers, percentages, zone numbers? At the end of the day, the players have got to buy in. We [had] to play the percentages and we did.”</p>\n<p>Yet, a quick 8-1 run helped the Mustangs trim UCSB’s lead to 62-49 heading into the fourth. It set the stage for their dominant start to the game’s final 10 minutes as they then went on a 9-2 run, bringing its deficit to 64-58 with 6:08 remaining following steal and made layup by Lynn Leaupepe.</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s lead being jeaopardized, Jemerigbe prevailed with a three-pointer to give UCSB some comfort. Regaining the Gauchos’ double-figure lead of 69-58 was a made layup by Toler.</p>\n<p>From that point on, UCSB scored one last field goal and scored the remainder of its points at the free-throw line where it finished 19-of-26.</p>\n<p>Ending the season at home and with a two-game winning streak is momentous for a Gaucho team preparing for March Madness beginning with the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Wednesday against the remaining highest seed at 8:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

However, foul trouble and low shooting percentage proved too much to overcome for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Williams showed he could play against the elite programs of the nation, putting up big numbers even though he was heavily guarded the entire night. Big Al did not get much help from his teammates as the team shot only 21 percent from three-point range and were heavily outrebounded, losing the battle 42-31.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, Kansas benefitted from a total team performance. Four players scored in double-digits for the Jayhawks with junior forward Perry Ellis scoring 13 and totaling 10 rebounds for the seventh double-double of his career.</p>\n<p>The game changer for Kansas came off the bench in the form of freshman guard Devonte’ Graham. Graham led the team with 14 points and spearheaded a first half 11-2 run that erased UCSB’s 15-14 lead; Graham scored eight of those points and assisted on the other bucket before the half ended with Kansas up 31-23.</p>\n<p>Before that run, UCSB had done a solid job on defense but its 27 percent shooting from the field in the half prevented the team from threatening Kansas even more.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Santa Barbara came to play to start the second half. Trailing by 12 three minutes into the half, the Gauchos scored 10 unanswered points with consecutive treys by freshman guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Zalmico Harmon cutting KU’s lead to 39-37.</p>\n<p>That was as close as UCSB got to taking back the lead, however, as foul trouble began to creep up for the Gauchos. Kansas scored 13 points from the charity stripe after the run and went to the line for 20 attempts in the half, shooting 80 percent. In total, the Jayhawks converted 23-32 free throws while UCSB went 9-14.</p>\n<p>Another bright spot for the Gauchos besides Big Al was junior guard John Green. Green entered early in the game after junior forward Mitch Brewe was forced to leave after picking up two early fouls. In 16 minutes of play, Green, who has been limited to four games in three years, had nine points on four-of-seven shots from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again today on the road against Florida-Gulf Coast University. FGCU plays in the Atlantic Sun conference and enters 1-0 on the season. Last year the team went 22-13 overall and was selected to the National Invitational Tournament. Two years ago, the program went to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is scheduled for <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_533765254\"><span class=\"aQJ\">4 p.m.</span></span> and can be seen on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/","id":503,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[502,501,500],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battling For Big West Tournament Seeding","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-3.03.20-PM.png?resize=980%2C636&ssl=1","description":"The month of March is finally upon us, nearly guaranteeing some of the best college basketball all season.

A loss would land the Gauchos as the No. 6 seed.</p>\n<p>If the aforementioned scenario occurs, although UC Riverside would have a better overall record than UCSB, the Gauchos would receive the No. 4 seed because of having the best win-loss record in conference games against common opponents beginning at the top of the standings, according to the Big West Tournament Regulations rulebook.</p>\n<p>In this case, Santa Barbara would earn the fourth seed and a first-round bye because of its win over current No. 2 seed Long Beach State earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Just one game ahead of last place Cal State Fullerton with a 4-24 and 2-12 conference record, UC Irvine is on the verge of clinching the No. 8 seed for the third-straight year in the hopes of squeezing into the Big West tournament. Meanwhile, Cal Poly sits a game behind UCSB in sixth place at 10-16, 6-8 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will enter Thursday looking to extend its four-game winning streak against UC Irvine. The Gauchos have a chance to win the season series over UC Irvine in back-to-back seasons.</p>\n<p>Dating back to when the two programs first faced each other on Jan. 28, UCSB recorded a program-high 15 made three-pointers and finished with season highs in points (85), field goal percentage (55.4) and win differential (25 points), all while tying its best three-point percentage (50).</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos’ three-point barrage was freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez. She finished with career highs of 22 points and seven made three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Since setting the new record, UCSB had struggled from beyond the arc, but seems to be getting back on track as it has shot over 30 percent from deep in two of its last three games in which it has made at least seven threes.</p>\n<p>While Thursday could potentially be the game to reignite the Gauchos’ perimeter shot, it is also an opportunity for them to improve upon their ball movement and pace on offense.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara tallied a season-high 23 assists in its win over UC Irvine. The success from three-point land may have led to UCSB becoming too comfortable from deep as its sharing of the ball decreased.</p>\n<p>In four of seven games, UCSB has recorded 20-plus three-point attempts and has had less than 20 assists in all seven contests.</p>\n<p>Despite the statistics showing a decline, the Gauchos still own one of the best passing backcourts in the conference. Both point guards senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler rank top five in total assists in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>Toler leads all players with 118, while Jemerigbe is fifth with 103. Both remain in the top five in assists per game as well with Toler in third with a 4.4 average and Jemerigbe with a 3.8 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>Success from behind the three-point line is influential on both sides as UC Irvine has become one of the top long-range shooting teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are coming off setting a program high of 15 made three pointers in their loss to Long Beach State on Saturday. Senior guard Irene Chavez and sophomore guard Andee Ritter combined for 41 points and were responsible for 12 of the team’s three-pointers. Both knocked down six trey balls, marking a career high for Chavez.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Ritter has made strides all season long as she currently leads the Big West in total threes and steals at 79 and 62, respectively. She is the only Anteater ever to make at least 70 three-pointers in a season.</p>\n<p>UCI holds a Big West-leading 38.2 three-point percentage through conference play and is second in made three pointers with 107.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the Cal Poly matchup, Saturday has the potential to be very intense as the two could be battling it out for a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be in search of repeating last season’s series sweep after defeating the Gauchos 78-67 on the conference’s opening day.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-game losing streak, Cal Poly is led by junior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who is the team’s leading scorer at 15 points per game, good for fifth in the Big West. She has tallied 20-plus points in three consecutive games and four of the Mustangs’ last five contests.</p>\n<p>Earning a season-high 29 points against UCSB earlier this season, Leaupepe will be the center of attention for the Gauchos’ defense as she has attempted a combined 48 shots in the team’s last two games.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s promising start diminished as the season progressed, it still has a chance to end the season with a first-round bye for the first time since the 2010-11 season.</p>\n<p>Tip-off between UCSB and UC Irvine will be Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m. Santa Barbara will face Cal Poly on Saturday, March 4 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 2, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos return home tonight to play in the Renee Trenholm Memorial against Idaho.</p>\n<p>With its sixth straight loss dating back to the end of last season, Santa Barbara opens the year at 0-1 while the Wolf Pack begins at 1-0.</p>\n<p>Coming into the game, the Gauchos knew they would have their hands full going up against last year’s Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year in senior Mimi Mungedi. The 6’8” center got her team off to a great start, making her first five shots as Nevada was off to an early 16-4 lead.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB kept itself in the game behind a balanced scoring attack, with junior guard Jasmine Ware eventually cutting the Wolf Pack’s lead to 23-21 off a jumpshot with 5:45 remaining in the first half. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, this was the closest they would come to taking the lead.</p>\n<p>Nevada continued to hold UCSB off for most of the game, eventually pushing its lead to 58-44 on the team’s only three-pointer of the night by Terilyn Moe with 5:41 left in the second half. The junior guard complemented Mungedi superbly from start to finish, tallying 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on her way to the first triple-double in program history.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to make one final push, eventually cutting the lead to 63-58 off a triple by freshman guard Makala Roper with just over two minutes remaining. However, they were unable to score another basket as the Wolf Pack closed the game on an 8-0 run to win 71-58.</p>\n<p>Another strong contributor for Nevada was junior forward Nyasha LeSure, who recorded a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds on an efficient 6-9 shooting night. The dominant Mungedi ended the game with 24 points, nine boards and four blocks on a near-perfect 11-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>While four players scored in double-digits for UCSB, an inefficient 19-68 from the field held them back for most of the night. Senior center Clair Watkins nearly recorded a double-double with 10 points to go along with eight rebounds, and Roper impressed off the bench to score a team-high 11 points on 3-5 shooting from downtown in her first career game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s attention tonight shifts to its next opponent in the University of Idaho. The Vandals continue a three-game west coast trip to open up their season after they lost their season opener to Cal State Northridge, 67-50.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Stacey Barr looks to be the focal point for Idaho’s offense, coming off a game in which she recorded team-highs with 18 points and 11 rebounds on 7-24 shooting. Junior guard Christina Salvatore and freshman post Geraldine McCorkell also chipped in with nine and 10 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be played in honor of longtime UCSB women’s basketball supporter Renee Trenholm, who passed away in May. Trenholm was the president of the Fastbreakers, a grassroots support group for the women’s basketball team, for over 15 years. The players will be wearing patches on their uniforms in memory of her contributions to the program on and off the court over the years.</p>\n<p>The game with Idaho is set to tip off tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58345\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58345\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/poor-shooting-dooms-gauchos/","id":505,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[504,503,502],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
