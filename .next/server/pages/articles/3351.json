He said that he attracted users over to the new subreddit by simply telling people on the current page to come transfer over, promising a better moderator presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, Boe worked in a team of three, including UCSB alumni u/beetling and u/Rlight. The team has worked hard to make the page “a place for inclusion” — where r/UCSantaBarbara members could come together and help one another, according to Boe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, however, that “place of inclusion” has grown substantially. In the last eight years, the number of submissions to the page has grown by nearly 500%, according to a post detailing the number of annual submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the page has become so popular that Boe and his team have found it hard to maintain the vast community on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been rather amazing watching this subreddit grow from an initial 50 to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers. However, lately, we’ve noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we’d prefer,” Boe detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the page’s growth, Boe posted a callout to the Reddit community in November, encouraging UCSB students to apply to become a new moderator and work alongside the current group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the callout was posted, Boe announced in a later post that month that two new moderators, fourth-year pharmacology major u/thejappster and third-year biological science major u/swimming_legend, had been selected. Both new moderators asked to be referred to only by their usernames, citing privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boe said the two new moderators stood out in the selection process because they were some of the most active people on the page. Their post history met Boe’s and u/beetling’s standards for the position and they both appeared to be students who genuinely cared about the UCSB Reddit community, Boe added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/thejappster said he used the subreddit to help him navigate his time at UCSB — researching classes, asking for advice and staying up to date on news in the community. As a new moderator, he said his focus is on promoting healthy discussion on a wide variety of topics, like local events and what professors or classes to take, and to encourage people with different views to express their opinions, as long as they are not attacking each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can get tricky in stressful situations, such as when the Thomas Fire occurred near campus three years ago. The stress of the situation led to an influx of content and information that was difficult to aggregate, u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, u/thejappster said the subreddit was meaningful to him because of the people who engage with it since they are often students, alumni or people who just live in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They really care about the subreddit and really care about helping people,” u/thejappster said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many others, u/swimming_legend joined the sub his first year at UCSB and said he hasn’t regretted it for a second. He said he uses the page for academic advice, social connections and a good laugh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although u/swimming_legend said he has not been a member of the Reddit page as long as the other moderators, he felt proud to have been “a member of a community that … has a positive impact on its members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said he is excited to implement new ideas for the page and create a more friendly and helpful experience for its users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new moderator team has already hit the ground running; u/swimming_legend said they are working on a new way to improve the design of the page and make it more user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important change that the team is working on, according to u/thejappster, is a way to consolidate all the posts about social groups — such as people who are looking for a group to hang out with in real life. That way people looking to make real friends or who are feeling lonely have a place to meet others in similar situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the team’s main focus has been around establishing a syllabus bank, which officially launched on Jan. 5, according to an </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ekf9et/syllabus_bank_new_for_winter_2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement on Reddit.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to u/thejappster, the bank is a resource where “users submit syllabi to an online database, like Google Drive and you post that link to the Reddit page.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current and forthcoming improvements to the Reddit page are not only for the benefit of the sub itself but also for the students’ lives, as they use the page as a resource for all things UCSB, Boe stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, having two current students as moderators will also help to better represent the current student perspective at UCSB, Boe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are the ones who have the opportunity and the time to put into making the community better.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:

I was not fond of his move to Miami, but other than that, the King has proven himself to be a very admirable person on and off the court.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71745\" style=\"width: 353px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71745\" data-attachment-id=\"71745\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/more-than-a-loss/gty-476489226-s-spo-bko-bkn-usa-oh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=1000%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"GTY 476489226 S SPO BKO BKN USA OH\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=250%2C174&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=888%2C616&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71745\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?resize=343%2C238\" alt=\"After averaging 30.1 ppg in the regular season, Curry only managed 22.6 ppg in the Finals.

Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>So when I took the stance that Curry was the best player in the NBA now, it was not out of spite, it was out of the true belief that I thought No. 30 for the Warriors was the best player.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure he couldn’t rebound or even pass like LeBron, but Steph’s brand of basketball is so much more special than that; it was something the league had never seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before this season, no player in NBA history made 300 three-pointers in a single season; Steph made 402. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry averaged 30.1points per game, the best in the league this season. A huge part of that is the deadly three ball he possesses. No player or team, for that matter, was able to drain the three ball as consistent as the two-time MVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he also joined the illustrious 50-40-90 club (50 percent shooting from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He isn’t LeBron, he will never be LeBron, but he was revolutionizing the game before our very eyes — something not even King James could ever do. He was so good that there were talks that a four-point line should be added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, Curry is clutch — or at least was before this NBA Finals — and has made big shots during his career, I mean, who could forget the shot that broke Oklahoma City’s heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, Curry went on to break the hearts of all Golden State fans in the game’s biggest stage: the NBA Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry was a disappointment in the Finals, to say the least. If you take out game four where he dropped 38, the NBA’s first unanimous MVP averaged 20 points per game, 10 points below his regular season average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in the biggest game of his career, a game seven at Oracle arena, No. 30 went 6-19 from the field, 4-14 from three, for a mere 17 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he had four turnovers, including a boneheaded, unnecessary behind the back pass that went out of bounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also was a big believer that even though LeBron was a way better defender than Curry, the fact is the NBA and its rules are geared toward offense. The art of true defending in the NBA has gone down a significant amount, so I was not going to hold that against Steph.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And Steph’s offense has been so explosive, it can overshadow his, at times, lackluster defense. Plus, he did lead the league in steals (2.1) so at the very least he tries to run around and disrupt plays.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71746\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71746\" data-attachment-id=\"71746\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/more-than-a-loss/636020081040379218-usatsi-9349709/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"534,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71746\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=280%2C210\" alt=\"Kyrie Irving's three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"280\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kyrie Irving’s three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at the end of game seven, it felt only fitting that the final bucket, scored by Kyrie Irving, came against Stephen Curry, who they had taken advantage of all series. His offensive game couldn’t make up for his defense and it cost him. Not just a game, it cost him a ring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is the MVP came up small on the biggest stage. I don’t want to imply Curry is overrated and has been lucky to this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph is still great, but he is not the best player in the NBA and he isn’t what we thought he was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the seven-second Phoenix Suns, it feels like the Cavs, and now the rest of the league figured out how to defend and get the best of him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, it’s possible Curry still could’ve been hurt, but that is no excuse. It’s game seven, you either show up, or you don’t, and he didn’t. </span>To his credit, Curry never once went to his injury as an excuse and even praised LeBron and the Cavs after their game seven victory at Oracle.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that Steph deserved his MVP trophy, 400 three’s speak for themselves. But now, there is also no doubt who the NBA’s best player is. For those who still continue to hate, and doubt the King, keep doing so, but it won’t change the fact he is the league’s most dominant player.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Basketball Association has too many teams. It’s time to embrace contraction. The talent pool has become too diluted and there are too many teams that are losing money, forcing the richer teams to prop up their poorer cousins via revenue sharing. There’s a simple, albeit practically and politically difficult, solution to both problems: contraction.</p>\n<p>There are currently 30 teams in the NBA. That’s the same as the MLB and two less than the NFL, so it’s not a large number in the American sports context. That said, it’s still too many. With 30 teams in the league competing for talent, what results is a massive inequality in talent. Simply put, there aren’t enough superstars or even just normal stars available for every team to be competitive.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a result, we get teams like the Warriors and the Rockets, with gluts of stars, competing against teams like the Hawks and the Cavaliers, with not a competent NBA starter in sight. Fewer teams would eliminate, or at least reduce, the number of unequal matchups in the NBA. The talent pool would stay the same while the number of teams competing for that talent pool would decrease, leading to talent spreading more evenly throughout the league.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple argument: Fewer teams means a more balanced league. What’s not so simple is the question of which teams get contracted. No one is going to volunteer to step up to the chopping block, after all. That’s where the revenue issue comes in.</p>\n<p>According to a 2017 ESPN report, 14 NBA teams lose money. The revenue-sharing system, however, takes some of the profits from the other 16 teams and spreads them out through the league to mitigate this issue. After these payouts, there are nine teams that spend more than they take in through revenue.</p>\n<p>Those nine teams are the Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Memphis Grizzlies, Milwaukee Bucks, Orlando Magic, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards. Those teams constitute our chopping block. If an NBA team is unprofitable even after it gets money from the rest of the league, it’s not a sustainable operation.</p>\n<p>We can trim that list down for regional reasons and arrive at a final list of six teams destined for contraction: the Nets, Hawks, Cavaliers, Bucks, Magic and Spurs. One of the first things that jumps out about that list is how Eastern Conference-heavy it is. After contraction, we’re left with 10 teams in the East and 14 in the West. There’s an easy fix: Move the New Orleans Pelicans and the Memphis Grizzlies to the East and we’re back at an even split of 12 each.</p>\n<p>This won’t be easy or uncontroversial by any means. There are, after all, plenty of Spurs, Bucks and maybe even Magic fans that won’t simply accept the disappearance of their favorite team. But for each team on that list, there’s a nearby alternative option. I’m not saying that glibly; I know that no Spurs fan is going to jump right to the Rockets or the Mavericks. After a few years, though, when passions have faded, we’ll see how things lie. Even if those fans don’t return, well, they weren’t exactly keeping their teams profitable in the first place.</p>\n<p>Some people might object to using profitability as the arbiter of life and death in the future NBA. In all honesty, I’m not entirely comfortable in using such a soulless, capitalist benchmark. The issue is that there aren’t any better options for solving these pressing issues.</p>\n<p>We can’t simply contract teams that are and have been bad. Talent fluctuates a lot more than revenue. Put in another way, players come and go but markets are much more stable. Anyway, contracting along those lines would take out my Sacramento Kings, and I can’t have that.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that there’s a better method of contraction. If there is, I’m open to hearing it. The fact is, however, that the NBA needs contraction.</p>\n<p>The superteam era has spawned an entire sub-industry of NBA takes on how to create a measure of parity in the league. What I’m arguing is that the way to combat superteams is to lean into them. There’s no such thing as a superteam when every team is a superteam. Not only would my contraction system combat superteam-ism, it would also be profitable for the league. By eliminating the teams that are losing money, the NBA would be able to reduce its revenue-sharing system, keeping more money in the pockets of the remaining teams.</p>\n<p>Reducing the number of teams to 24 will improve the quality of play and reduce the number of teams losing money, all while making sure that every fan in every part of the country has a regional team to root for. The NBA doesn’t want to contract, but it needs to do it anyway.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/","id":3349,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[3348,3347,3346],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thirty Meter Telescope Project Now To Be Paused Until February 2020","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Construction for the Thirty Meter Telescope at Mauna Kea, a controversial project for which UC Santa Barbara’s Chancellor Henry T.

But in a new deal with Hawaii County, made on Dec. 26, protestors have instead agreed to move aside and unblock the access road, Hawaii News Now reported. The protestors will still remain at the site.</p>\n<p>Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said in a letter to protesters that “there will be no attempt to deliver construction equipment to Maunakea anytime soon.” Additionally, he added that “State and County agencies and law enforcement agencies will agree to stand down… there will be no attempt to remove [the] protector’s encampment.”</p>\n<p>The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians who claim it is desecrating Mauna Kea, believed to be one of the most sacred areas in all of Hawaii, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p>\n<p>The decision to halt construction came from the TMT International Observatory LLC (TMT) over safety concerns for workers and protestors, according to a statement from Gordon Squires, vice president for external relations for TMT.</p>\n<p>“The state and Hawaii County have not demonstrated that they are able to provide safe, sustained access to Maunakea for everyone,” Squire said. In the past six months alone, the Hawaiian Government has spent over $15 million on law enforcement for the site, the Star Advisor reported.</p>\n<p>Squire also noted that the organization is taking opposition to its project into account.</p>\n<p>“We are sensitive to the ongoing struggles of indigenous populations around the world, and we will continue to support conversations around TMT and the larger issues for which it has become a flashpoint,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Yang currently chairs the Thirty Meter Telescope’s board of governors, and his involvement faced backlash over the summer from students who opposed the project.</p>\n<p>In September, the UC Student Association (UCSA), which is comprised of every UC student government, wrote a letter opposing the telescope and the UC’s involvement in the project.</p>\n<p>In December, UCSB’s Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and the American Indian Student Association (AISA) brought Native Hawaiian protestors to campus to discuss their opposition to the project and urge students to support their cause.</p>\n<p>Despite the announcement about pausing TMT’s construction, Hawaiian elders and protest leaders said they were skeptical about TMT’s decision to pause construction after initially being given a deadline to vacate the area, according to the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>“[Governor Ige] making an obtuse statement that TMT has announced that they’re not coming for a while just doesn’t hold any water for us,” Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, a protest leader, told the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>Daevionne Beasley, the EVPSA of UCSB’s Associated Students, called the new announcements a “ploy” to remove protestors from Mauna Kea and clear the area for construction to resume.</p>\n<p>“When I had first heard [TMT was] halting the construction, I thought it was a good idea,” Beasley said, who has previously spoken to Yang about his involvement with TMT and is a co-signer of the UCSA letter.</p>\n<p>But combined with the fact that protesters have to move their tents to the side of the access road, Beasley believes “the government is trying to push [protesters] out so that [TMT is] able to go in and resume construction whenever they see fit.”</p>\n<p>Beasley also believes the protesters’ biggest point of contention with TMT — its location on historically sacred land — can be remedied by breaking ground in a new location that doesn’t impose on “someone else’s indigeneous land.”</p>\n<p>“The only solution in my head is to pause all development on the telescope until science is able to advance where [TMT doesn’t] have to build a telescope in an area where it would affect indigenous people,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
