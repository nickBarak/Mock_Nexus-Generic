Tony Borrayo died in the early hours of the morning while he was asleep at home with his family last Sunday on Jan. 4.</p>\n<p>A cause of death has not been determined. During his time with UCPD, Borrayo received numerous awards and accolades, including a Supervisory Certificate from the California Peace Officers Standardized Training and the prestigious H. Thomas Guerry Award, given to officers by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for excellence in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>According to Borravo’s colleague and UCPD officer Sgt. Mark Signa, Borrayo was an “amazing member” of the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Borrayo has been a friend and part of the UC/IV community for almost 20 years,” Signa said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to a statement released by the Office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Borrayo is Santa Barbara born and raised, and graduated from Dos Pueblos High School in Santa Barbara before attending Santa Barbara City College. He began his career at UCSB in 1994, when he worked at the UCen and in the Parking and Transportation Services before eventually becoming a police officer with UCPD.</p>\n<p>According to Assistant Director of Student Programs Marilyn Dukes, Borrayo was a highly regarded member of UCPD and said his passing was unexpected.</p>\n<p>“[I] have worked with Tony at events for many years, so his passing came as quite a shock,” Dukes said. “Tony was very committed to his work and to the campus community and my sympathies go out to his family and the UCPD who are, no doubt, feeling his loss very deeply.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang’s statement, Borrayo represented both the department and the community at multiple events and ceremonies throughout the state. Borrayo also helped in the creation of the UCPD Honor Guard, and recently joined an advocacy group to aid undocumented students and Dream Scholars.</p>\n<p>A memorial service was held on Friday, Jan. 9 at St. Raphael Catholic Church in Goleta. UCPD officers wore memorial patches over their badges in his memory.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59690\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59690\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/campus-remembers-ucpd-officer/","id":2947,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[2946,2945,2944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian","biography":"Not available","articles":[2931,2947,2960,3459,3760,3773,3778,3779,3780,3781,3782,3784,3936,3937,3938,3940,3941,3942,4622,4747,4772,4783,4790,4796],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Professor Dies Over Winter Break","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"74-year-old materials professor Edward Kramer (far right) died in his sleep at his home in Santa Barbara on the morning of Dec 27.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_59415\" style=\"width: 336px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"463889733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59415\" data-attachment-id=\"59415\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/ucsb-professor-dies-over-winter-break/image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\\u00a9UCSB Photographic Services\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image-683x1024.jpg?resize=326%2C490\" alt=\"Materials professor Edward Kramer died on the morning of Dec 27.

He had been a professor at UCSB with the department of materials and jointly with the chemical engineering department since 1997. <em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Public Affairs &amp; Communications</em></p></div>\n<p>75-year-old materials professor Edward Kramer died in his sleep at his home in Santa Barbara on the morning of Dec 27.</p>\n<p>Kramer had been a professor at the university with the department of materials and jointly with the chemical engineering department since 1997, when he was recruited out of a 30-year career in materials science at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Kramer is survived by his wife, Gail, their children Jeanne and Eric his grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Kramer graduated from Cornell University in 1962 with a Bachelors in chemical engineering and earned a Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1966. He joined the faculty of Cornell University in 1967 and in 1973 authored a paper that greatly expanded current knowledge on a phenomenon called flux pinning, where exceptionally conductive materials are suspended in space above a magnet. While at UCSB, Kramer worked collaboratively with various professors, post-doctoral scholars and Ph.D. candidates, particularly in the area of polymer science, in which he was considered an expert.</p>\n<p>Rod C. Alferness, Dean of the College of Engineering, said the death of Kramer was unexpected despite a recent heart surgery.</p>\n<p>“Its a huge loss,” Alferness said. “It came as a shock; I was not expecting it to happen at this time. There’s a sense of loss both for the college and the university.”</p>\n<p>Kramer’s longtime colleague, chemical engineering professor Glenn Fredrickson, said while Kramer’s heart surgery had taken place several months ago and he was in recovery, Kramer had been active in the research lab and had attended the dissertation defense of two of his Ph.D. students just a week prior to his death.</p>\n<p>“He had been very active and animated during the discussion and questioning period, so we had a sense that he was on the mend and was his old self,” Fredrickson said. “Everybody who had interacted with him just a week ago had a sense that it was all uphill from there, we were really taken aback by this.”</p>\n<p>According to Materials Dept. chair Tresa Pollock, Kramer was a devoted faculty member who took pride in the achievements of the students he mentored.</p>\n<p>“He was a very dedicated teacher and mentor,” Pollock said.“He put a tremendous amount of effort into developing his courses and teaching them carefully.”</p>\n<p>Kramer was set to teach an undergraduate course this quarter in the chemical engineering department, Introduction to Polymer Science, which Pollock said would be filled by Rachel Segalman, a former student and colleague of Kramer at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>According to Alferness, Kramer was planning to retire from his faculty position at the end of the year and would not have taken on any new graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, but would have remained with the university as a researcher.</p>\n<p>Alferness also said Kramer was a role model for younger faculty and mentioned that Kramer and his wife donated enough money to the university to establish an endowed chair position that has yet to be filled within the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“He was a great citizen on campus as well and a strong advocate for UCSB. A very wise person. Everyone will tell you who knows him, he was truly a gentleman and served as a wonderful mentor,” Alferness said. “[Establishing an endowed chair] is not a typical thing for faculty to do; it speaks to his view of the importance of education.”</p>\n<p>Kramer also led the Kramer/Fredrickson research group within the Materials Research Laboratory. The group’s research primarily focused on studying certain properties of block copolymers, materials made up of block-like structures of multiple molecules. Specifically, the group’s recent research has centered on understanding the processes by which certain materials melt, as well as the process of directed self-assembly. According to the Institute for Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, directed self-assembly is a process by which molecules of certain materials spontaneously come together, or “self-assemble”.</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, a longtime collaborator of Kramer’s, Kramer was among the first to develop the field of examining directed self-assembly and did some of the early experimentation on the process and that Fredrickson used his work in a theoretical research group in materials research.</p>\n<p>“He did a lot the early pioneering work on directed self assembly … and looking at how polymers assemble themselves in confined ‘wells’ within a thin film,” Fredrickson said. “My group has subsequently developed theoretical tools for simulating polymers under confinement and much of that was simulated by experimental work [from] his group.”</p>\n<p>Fredrickson also said Kramer’s work on the directed self-assembly processes represents an advancement in the way certain products are manufactured.</p>\n<p>“Now its become [a] technology that companies like Intel and Sony viewing it as a strategy for next generation patterning of semi-conductor devices,” Fredrickson said. “Being able to make smaller features on devices than they currently can now, the strategy for making microprocessors faster is to shrink the devices and that requires patterning on smaller and smaller length scales.”</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, Kramer was one of the first people to work on the process in a “methodical, systematic experimental way” that has set the stage for it to become a “developing technology.”</p>\n<p>According to Nate Lynd, an assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at University of Texas, Austin, and formerly a post-doctoral researcher under Kramer at UCSB, the late professor’s work with the group was unique given his level of involvement in the group’s work.</p>\n<p>“Ed very much liked to be involved,” Lynd said. “You would sometimes see the light on in his office in the evening he would be working on data himself which I think is somewhat rare for a professor this late in his career.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Kramer’s contributions to materials science are “legendary”.</p>\n<p>“He helped to elevate the stature of our university and our top-ranked Materials and Chemical Engineering departments, and provided exemplary leadership and service to our campus community in so many other ways as well, including co-chairing the search advisory committees for our previous and current Dean of Engineering,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Lynd also said Kramer fostered an atmosphere of collaboration in the various research efforts he took part in and various faculty members and departments would be involved in the polymer research Kramer carried out.</p>\n<p>“What was really great about Ed’s group was just how well integrated it was with the research efforts others, with the research of other faculty at UCSB,” Lynd said. “It was this incorporation of the contributions of the expertise of many people that had made a lot of this research great and Ed. This was his modus operandi, and he was a big cheerleader of carrying out collaborative research.”</p>\n<p>Lynd said Kramer aided him greatly in his postdoctoral studies and taught him to work collaboratively with others in the group.</p>\n<p>“Recognizing what kind of peg you are and finding the right hole on the team, that’s something Ed definitely helped me with,” Lynd said, “and since that time things went just great … I really owe a lot to Ed.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Kramer’s age as 74, he was actually 75. The article also incorrectly described the directed self-assembly process as spontaneous, it actually occurs in controlled environments under the influence of researchers. The article also incorrectly stated Fredrickson used Kramer’s scholarship in his own work, this is also incorrect, Fredrickson used his work in a collaborative theoretical research group composed of graduate students and other researchers. This article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Materials professor and recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics Shuji Nakamura was named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) on Dec 16.</p>\n<p>Nakamura will be inducted into NAI on March 20, along with 170 other newly named NAI fellows, as part of the 4th Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where fellows will be awarded trophies, medals and rosette pins. The NAI is a non-profit organization with 414 fellows, collectively holding nearly 14,000 U.S. patents and representing over 150 institutions, and it serves to recognize inventors who hold U.S. Patents. Nominees must be named inventors on at least one patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are chosen by their peers and then later approved by a selection committee.</p>\n<p>Nakamura said in an email that he credits the NAI honor to his invention of the energy efficient blue light emitting diode (LED) and blue laser diodes, for which he was recently also awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Nakmura also said his inspiration for his work comes from a deep examination of the world around him.</p>\n<p>“I like to think about anything deeply to understand the mechanism behind the scene,” Nakamura said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI President, founder and AAAS-Lemelson Invention Ambassador Paul R. Sanberg said designation as a fellow is the only high-level national honor specifically available to academic inventors.</p>\n<p>“The NAI fellows are prolific innovators whose discoveries and inventions have fostered new ideas, products and companies that benefit their institutions and communities and are making an impact on society,” Sanberg said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI Vice President George Newkome, who himself holds 45 patents and has published 450 scientific papers, said Nakamura’s fellowship will lead the way for more faculty at the university to become NAI fellows in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that professor Nakamura was chosen to be a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors it is a true honor to be part of NAI and I am sure that many others from UCSB will be following in his footsteps,” Newkome said in an email.</p>\n<p>Two other faculty are also NAI fellows — Materials Professor and Co-Director of UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) Steven DenBaars and Chemical Engineering professor and Founding Director of the Center for Bioengineering Samir Mitragotri.</p>\n<p>According to DenBaars, Nakamura’s fellowship further reinforces his position as a world renown innovator and highlights the widely impactful effect he has made globally with his innvention of the LED.</p>\n<p>“As a colleague and co-director of SSLEEC I am delighted that Shuji Nakamura is a new NAI Fellow,” DenBaars said in an email. “This is a strong endorsement of Shuji inventions and patents he has filed since coming to UCSB 14 years ago. This is indicative of Shuji’s innovative research and world-leading status of UCSB’s materials department.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitragotri, Nakamura’s election to the NIA is a significant recognition of his accomplishments in physics and materials science.</p>\n<p>“In addition to celebrating innovation, NAI enables the fellow to collectively think about some of the important aspects of promoting and sustaining academic innovation,” Mitragotri said in an email. “Shuji has made some of the most significant inventions of our generation. His election to NAI recognizes his accomplishments.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/","id":2945,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2944,2943,2942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee convened in the State St. room in the UCen on Monday. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room in the UCen on Monday evening to listen to and grant funding requests to various student organizations.</p>\n<p>Three groups received full funding before the Board lost forum due to an inadequate number of members and continued in discussion over what they would decide to fund when the Board met again. Groups that received full funding included El Congreso, receiving $10,000 for their Raza College Rally, the Japanese Language Café receiving $250 and finally Chicano/Chicana Grads, which received $14,077 to hold an alternative graduation for Latino/Latina students. Cotillion Dance’s request for $150 for a non-dance social at the Student Resources Building was tabled after representatives for the club failed to show up to the meeting. The other groups will now wait to hear back from the Board and will receive responses to their funding requests when the A.S. Senate meets this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Student comedy group Laughology requested $6,510 for their six upcoming shows after explaining that they had an impressive lineup including Dana Gould, a writer for the Simpsons, and Grammy Award winning comic Tig Notaro.</p>\n<p>“Winter quarter is historically slow for just about everything. It’s really hard to get people to come in — not true for us,” a spokesperson for the club said. “It seems like we are on a bit of a snowball effect here and we’ve got a really crazy order of comedians lined up. It is probably the best quarter we have ever booked.”</p>\n<p>The American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE), a student association of chemical engineering students, asked for $842 for funding for an annual Southern California regional mixer that will be open to all students on campus at all year levels.</p>\n<p>The event will feature AIChE representatives from six universities and 80 chapters, according to AIChE Internal Vice President and third-year chemical engineering major Dilpreet Kaur.</p>\n<p>“Specifically right now, it is a very important for us to go because our current president is resigning due to personal issues and we have two other people stepping up in leadership,” Kaur said. “This conference will give a great opportunity for them to talk to other leaders and the other organizations and see how we can complete our events for this year and get advice on running our chapter.”</p>\n<p>The Lindy Circle, a Goleta-based dance organization, came to request $2,632 for a dancing event with a band they have every quarter. Representatives for the club said this year’s event will feature a premier swing dance act led by jazz guitarist Jonathan Stout.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Ensemble Troupe, a women’s student theatre organization on campus, requested $3,000 to put on the Vagina Monologues, an ensemble performance play featuring women’s personal perspectives on love, sex, rape, gender and other issues, held each Winter quarter. In addition, the Muslim Student Association requested an additional $284 for transportation to an upcoming MSA conference at UCLA. The Chinese Students and Scholars Association also requested to re-allocate $324, the Women’s Ensemble requested $3,000, literary arts magazine the Catalyst requested $4,759, Laughology requested $6510, the Lindy Circle requested $2,632 and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers requested $842.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59683\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59683\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-requests/","id":2946,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2945,2944,2943],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
