After leaving the Packers in 2008 to play three more seasons with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings, the 45-year old feared he’d never step foot on Lambeau Field again. But the Green Bay legend was proved wrong last Saturday as more than 67,000 “Cheese Heads” celebrated their former quarterback’s induction to the Packer Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>Such a nostalgic feeling, this moment couldn’t have felt more suitable for the legendary Packer. After being drafted in the second round and spending just one season with the Atlanta Falcons, Favre found a home in the city of Green Bay after being He was traded from Atlanta to Green Bay in 1992.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long until the quarterback from Southern Mississippi made his mark on the Packer team and steered their struggling franchise back in the right direction.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to the Favre era, the Packers had only two playoff appearances under their belt since their run with the great Vince Lombardi. A plague of losing seasons overtook the franchise and changes were made with the hiring of Head Coach Mike Holmgren. With a new coaching staff in place and a gun-slinging quarterback at the helm in Brett Favre, the Packers brought back a competitive spirit to their hometown.</p>\n<p>Green Bay made its first postseason appearance since 1983 after the quarterback’s arrival. Favre led the Packers to a total of 11 playoff runs, finishing with the record for most passing yards, touchdowns, and pass completions in team history.</p>\n<p>With this type of resume, not to mention a record of 160 wins as a Packer, Favre rightfully deserves a seat next to the yellow and green greats.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre is one of six Packers ever to have a banner hanging in Lambeau Field. With a stadium that features some of the greatest football athletes to play the game like Bart Starr, Reggie White, and football mastermind Vince Lombardi, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13280080/brett-favre-humbled-fan-response-green-bay-packers-hall-fame-induction\">“It’s quite an honor”, Favre said. “When you look at the players that go into this [category] and to be a part of that it’s hard to put into words.”</a></p>\n<p>Favre’s sixteen years of two minute drives, Super Bowl runs, and “Lambeau leaps” as a Packer outweigh his decision of exiting retirement and joining the rival Vikings. Sure some hearts were broken since his seven-year split with the team, but from this moment on that is water under the bridge. Favre’s return brings him back to his true home and his remembrance in Green Bay will forever be a grateful one.</p>\n<p>While the fans pay tribute to his career in a green and yellow uniform, it is Favre himself who is really saying thank you. The three NFL MVP awards, Superbowl XXXI ring, and career in the NFL are accredited to the loyal fans of Wisconsin and their support throughout the years. Through triumph and adversity, they stuck with the Southern quarterback from Gulfport, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Brett Favre has accomplished many milestones since his start in the NFL. The 19-year veteran has surpassed greats in records, been at the highest pinnacle of football, and distinguished himself as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever step foot on a field. But having his No. 4 jersey hung up in Lambeau has to be the sweetest victory of all. After facing boos and chants of “traitor” while being a Jet and Viking, Favre assumed that would be the end of his journey in Green Bay. But last Saturday surely put his fears to rest as his journey lives on as a Packer. From this day on he will never be forgotten as one. The induction ceremony was a day full of the cheers and chants that Favre had become accustomed to while in Green Bay. With that entrance and induction, the Packer legend explained, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13280080/brett-favre-humbled-fan-response-green-bay-packers-hall-fame-induction\">“it was like I never left.”</a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

carillon – the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai – sits high in the tower, at 175 feet in the air.

Currently, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the next candidate in line for a major payday. While some may disagree, Wilson seems to be the ideal frontrunner for young quarterbacks on the brink of sealing the coveted “elite” label.</p>\n<p>Constant speculation of the contract negotiations between Wilson and the Seahawks have generated the possibility of him becoming the highest-paid player in the NFL. Despite being drafted as the 75<sup>th</sup> pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft in which five different quarterbacks were drafted before him, Wilson has proved that he belongs and can survive in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Of that 2012 draft class, Wilson, Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill are the only names of quarterbacks that are still prevalent within NFL storylines. While Luck was the No. 1 overall draft pick and first quarterback off the board, Wilson has had the most success out of the 2012 draftees.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Entering the final year of his rookie contract with a set salary of $1.5 million, the Seahawks’ field general is well deserving of a multi-year contract that could make him the NFL’s richest man. With quarterbacks like Cam Newton, Tannehill, RG3 earning contract extensions, and Luck with plans of receiving a surplus of money, the legendary slogan of “numbers never lie” is the one thing that separates Wilson from the rest.</p>\n<p>Since entering the league in 2012, Wilson’s 36 regular-season wins are the most by any quarterback in his first three seasons, he has an NFL-high 15 fourth quarter/comeback victories, and helped lead Seattle to its first Super Bowl win in franchise history out of two consecutive championship trips.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversial play call that resulted with a game-winning interception by Malcolm Butler to secure the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory, it is inevitable that Wilson has completely transformed the Seahawks from being a below average team into a consistent postseason contender. Prior to Wilson’s arrival, Seattle had not won a playoff game since its upset victory versus the New Orleans Saints in 2010.</p>\n<p>Besides proving himself as a quarterback capable of competing and winning at the NFL level, Wilson’s dual-threat skillset is another viable attribute that must be valued during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>His combination of being an efficient pocket passer and his playmaking abilities when on the run are what have allowed him to become one of the NFL’s current best quarterbacks. While injuries have plagued the former 2012 Offensive Rookie of the Year in RG3 and Newton possessing these same dual-threat talents, Wilson has perfected the balance between passing and rushing the ball. While the numbers may not show significant changes, Wilson has gradually improved each season in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>However, while Wilson’s performance has been the primary drive behind the Seahawks’ resurgence, the supporting cast of having the NFL’s best defense and arguably best running back in Marshawn Lynch are factors that lead to Seattle’s caution when negotiating the quarterback’s long-term contract.</p>\n<p>Whenever Wilson has been unable to produce for Seattle offensively, it has been the Seahawks defense that has carried the load. Primarily led by original “Legion of Boom” members such as Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas III, the Seahawks defense has consistently ranked amongst the top in points, passing, rushing, and total yards allowed.</p>\n<p>Commonly known for his “Beastmode” moniker, Lynch’s downhill, gritty running style has definitely made Wilson’s quarterbacking job a lot easier. Despite a slow start to his first year as a Seahawk in 2010, Lynch has rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his last four seasons.  He tied for an NFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns and finished fifth in total rushing yards with 1,306 this past season.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wilson has yet to throw 30-plus touchdown passes or break the 4,000 yard mark for passing in his career may be alarming for some, but it doesn’t mean the man doesn’t deserve his money. With the addition of tight-end Jimmy Graham, Wilson has another weapon in his arsenal that can help elevate his stature on the field.</p>\n<p>While some may not even consider him to be a top-five NFL quarterback, Wilson has undoubtedly helped turn Seattle into a winning organization. At the end of the day, the Seahawks must realize how valuable of a steal Wilson has been since his arrival in Seattle and can show their appreciation for him with a new contract this offseason.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64347\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64347\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-25/too-dangeruss-of-a-risk/","id":3280,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3279,3278,3277],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Special Olympics: Not All Superheroes Wear Capes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"What makes someone a hero?

Over 500,000 people filled the Los Angeles Coliseum on Sunday in an honorary tribute to our daily heroes with special needs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a weeks worth of competition over 160 represented countries, families and friends from all over applauded these athletes for their valiant efforts and hard work.</p>\n<p>More than 6,500 athletes participated in disciplines ranging from weightlifting, horseback riding, the 100-yard dash, and dozens of other competitions. While it was strictly business for some athletes in a tight race for first, none could hold back the smiles after taking that final pedestal bow in front of thousands of fans.</p>\n<p>A tradition that started in 1968, the Special Olympics has been a tool for hope and inspired many all over who suffer from special needs. This iconic ceremony let the world know that being a great athlete isn’t decided by one’s physical appearance or abilities, but rather by strength within.</p>\n<p>Take Scott Rohrer as a prime example. An individual that suffers from autism, Rohrer did not let his medical condition be a setback.</p>\n<p>The Special Olympics Team USA golfer earned himself a new record on Sunday posting a career low 276, or 12 under par. The golfer’s success has been a common occurrence during the Special Olympics winning three gold medals in 2007, 2009, and 2011.</p>\n<p>Rohrer told ESPN that in all of his golf moments, winning Special Olympics gold ranks “at the top.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never felt anything like this before and it’s a true honor,” he said.</p>\n<p>The four-time champ was not the only athlete that made his mark on Sunday. After 38 battles with liver malfunctions, kidney defects, and strokes, the 5-foot, 2-inch Chevi Peters proved doubters wrong putting on that Team USA uniform.</p>\n<p>With a little lift from his trainer John Lair, Peters accomplished one of his biggest dreams on Sunday – taking first place in the Special Olympics.</p>\n<p>The Kansas native qualified for the combination event, a series of three lifts starting with squats, bench-press, and deadlifts. After pressing a combined 408 pounds in the squat and bench only one more lift stood in the way of Peter’s gold medal.</p>\n<p>Deadlifting a total of 325 pounds and finishing the event with a total of 733 pounds, the “Manimal” lived up to his nickname and embraced his coach in an emotional victory.</p>\n<p>“If you put your mind to it with hard work and dedication anything is possible,” Peters said in an interview with ESPN.</p>\n<p>The lifter went home to Parsons, Kansas with 4 medals in total, one silver and three gold.</p>\n<p>His will to never give up is a testament to younger ones everywhere. Peters proved that dreams can come true and that you can inspire those around you. These are the true ingredients to being a hero.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-10/special-olympics-not-all-superheroes-wear-capes/","id":3281,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3280,3279,3278],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
