He allowed just five hits on the day and struck out four.</p>\n<p>The offense was led by a huge day from sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward, who drove in five runs on two hits and scored a run. Woodward got his afternoon rolling in the bottom of the third inning. With the bases loaded, Woodward singled into right center field to plate the first two runs of the game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa also drove in two runs with his fourth home run of the season in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the offense was unable to reproduce Friday’s success as the Tigers captured a 3-2 win over the Gauchos. Junior starting pitcher John Haberman earned the win, throwing seven and a third innings and allowing just two runs while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Robby Nesovic also pitched well, but took the loss, going six and a third and allowed three runs.</p>\n<p>Pacific got on the board first with a lead off single and two productive outs to lead to the run on sophomore center fielder Tyler Sullivan’s base hit.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitchers cruised until the seventh where they each ran into some trouble. Nesovic was touched up for two more runs on a string of singles off both Nesovic and sophomore reliever Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the inning, the Gauchos scored their first run on an RBI single by Nesovic. In the eighth the Gauchos, who have become notorious in recent weeks for their comebacks, mustered a rally for one run, but junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon bounced into an inning ending double play and the Gauchos fell 3-2.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s home finale, the Gauchos put a seven spot on Pacific. UCSB wasted no time as they put up three runs in the bottom of the first with four consecutive singles.</p>\n<p>With the early lead sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Vasquez settled into one of his best starts of the year. Vasquez threw seven and a third shutout innings with five strikeouts en route to his second victory this season.</p>\n<p>In his home finale, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled and also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly helping his team to take the victory 7-3.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Venning said. “We needed to win this one; obviously all these games are important now.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to UCLA on Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page five of May 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/","id":4472,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4471,4470,4469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Pardall, Del Norte To Get Traffic Lights","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Traffic-lights-by-Jenny-Luo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara County will install traffic signals this summer at the busy intersection between Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte in Isla Vista’s business district.

Half of the funding will come from the public works department and the other half from UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The project will begin in late summer, and the department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The county will determine a specific start date after removing pre-existing streetlight infrastructure at the intersection.</p>\n<p>Given the high traffic at the intersection, the construction will occur almost entirely on the sidewalk area. Some street shoulders are expected to be closed.</p>\n<p>The intersection has two stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic, giving eastbound and westbound traffic the right of way at all times.</p>\n<p>An increase in bike and car traffic over the years contributed to the change. Scott McGolpin, the county public works director, presented the project at an I.V. Community Network Meeting in January.</p>\n<p>“This project should provide a much more orderly and functional intersection, safely integrating bicycle, pedestrian and auto traffic,” George Thurlow, the university’s liaison for I.V. affairs, said.</p>\n<p>The original plan involved the installation of two traffic signals, one at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte and the other at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p>The county determined that only one signal was necessary with the hope that the signal on Embarcadero Del Norte will cause sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic at the Embarcadero Del Mar intersection.</p>\n<p>The county also proposed a four-way stop and a roundabout for this intersection, but officials concluded that neither would be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes coming through the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to a traffic signal,” McGolpin said. “It will allow the bikes that are coming out of the campus to see the red bulb and slow down a little bit and allow the signal to go through a 15–20-second cycle. It’s definitely going to be new for I.V.”</p>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District board chair and a 35-year I.V. resident, said she has noticed cars and delivery trucks having difficulty crossing while students ride their bicycles during the busiest times of the day.</p>\n<p>“Safety is the biggest concern,” she said. “Whatever is put there, I hope people are paying attention and being careful.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75599\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75599\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/pardall-del-norte-to-get-traffic-lights/","id":4469,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[4468,4467,4466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Surf Report: Feb. 10 to 12","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When are the swells swell?

Knew you’d be back again for the inside on catching the insides this weekend. Now, because of the overwhelming demand on my surf expertise, I have decided to bless ya with yet another completely accurate compilation of my surf report. If y’all didn’t catch that last bit of sarcasm, I wish you the best with reading the rest of this and hope you know these are surf predictions, not something to bet your life on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, let’s move on to the nitty gritty. Now, the west-northwest swell (WNW) is making an appearance this weekend, meaning those ocean storms are still blowing over here. It’s not the strongest surge, but it’s definitely causing some waves for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s take a look at the three amigos, shall we?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday: best swells, worst weather; 4-6 feet, largest waves in the p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday: average swells, average weather; 3-5 feet, better surf in the a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday: eh swells, but great weather; 1-3 feet all day</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before you go running off asking the paddle boarders for some wax (please don’t), let me warn you about the rain coming on Friday. Oftentimes, rain means bacterial runoff being really present in the water during and after first day of rain. I know your surfing urges plunge you into the water despite possible sickness, but please be careful. Take care of yourself for finals, okay? Don’t say I never warned the freshies. Have a swell weekend!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/surf-report-feb-10-to-12/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/surf-report-feb-10-to-12/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/surf-report-feb-10-to-12/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/surf-report-feb-10-to-12/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/surf-report-feb-10-to-12/","id":4470,"author":{"id":103,"name":"Rebekah Akiyoshi"},"related":[4469,4468,4467],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LARPers Duel at Dogshit Park","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ChristineSkari8_Larp_10.12.2014.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ChristineSkari8_Larp_10.12.2014.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Around 20 Isla Vista residents faought each other with foam-covered plastic pipes in live action role-play, also known as LARP.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 20 Isla Vista residents charged into battle at “Dogshit Park” on Sunday afternoon, fighting each other with foam-covered plastic pipes in live action role-play, also known as LARP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are you ready for glory?” shouted Tomek Fraczek, a fourth-year physics major, right before one of the battles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three members from the UCSB Excursion Club organized this year’s game after the tradition began two years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camoron Jordan, UCSB alumnus and one of the event organizers, said his friend, Nik Frey, organized the event for the last two years, and he wanted to continue the tradition out of “respect for him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While last year’s event raised money for Lymphoma research, third-year economics and accounting major John Duston said this year’s LARP would not be donating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Duston, the group would like to add donations back into the event next year.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Next year, we hope to bring back the charitable donations, because that was something that Nik was really into, so we wanted to continue this legacy with that,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rules of the game are simple: Any hits above the knee counted as a death while any hits below the elbow or knee meant a lost arm or leg. Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one. Several warriors flung their arms around and slowly fell after being hit by a finishing blow, emphasizing the worthiness of their defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter McCoole, a communication major currently taking a hiatus from school, was walking her dog when she saw the warriors fighting outside her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looks like it was played safe. Everyone looked super stoked, and I think it’s great that everyone came outdoors and just had fun instead of being inside and studying,” McCoole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 30 minutes of the LARP, Police Officer Andy Radujko stopped by on his motorcycle and took out his baton, jokingly ready to battle with the rest of the warriors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radujko used to engage in a similar activity during high school and said it was great that Excursion Club was hosting the event. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/","id":4471,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[4470,4469,4468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
