The Honeysticks made the trip to UC Santa Barbara to play some of their more well-known tunes as well as to screen some new songs from their as-of-now unreleased EP by the working title of “Honeysticks 2.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group consists of members Ricky Montgomery (lead vocals, guitar and keyboard), Ben Russin (bass guitar), Larry Scanniello (guitar) and Ryan Fyffe (drums). The Honeysticks initially formed as a touring band under the name, Ricky Montgomery &amp; The Honeysticks, before ultimately shortening their title to their current moniker, The Honeysticks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Honeysticks, who have played shows across Los Angeles in venues such as The Observatory and El Cid on Sunset Boulevard, found a new favorite venue this week at our own humble Storke Plaza. Starting shortly after noon, The Honeysticks drew a hearty crowd to Storke’s steps with their distinctive, bedroom-pop-inspired sound.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout their set, students passing by the University Center stopped and enjoyed the fresh tunes while enjoying their lunches. The Honeysticks’ performance was a welcome addition to the bustling plaza, and their impassioned delivery drew the attention of many passersby. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after finishing their performance in the plaza — after twice conceding “one last song” to enthralled audience members — The Honeysticks were quickly approached by  students interested in getting a chance to meet and greet their members. After a quick photo-op and some merchandise distribution, the members of The Honeysticks sat down with the Nexus to talk more about their experience playing at Storke Plaza as well as their origins as a group and their plans for the future.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91622\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"30047288\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91620\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91622\" data-attachment-id=\"91622\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-03/the-honeysticks-sweeten-storke-plaza/ep-cover/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ep cover\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91622\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ep-cover.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91622\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The artwork for The Honeysticks’ EP “The Honeysticks.” Courtesy of The Honeysticks</p></div>\n<p><b>Max Myszkowski: How did you come up with the name, “The Honeysticks”? Is there any background to it, or was it just catchy?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was partly just because we thought it was catchy, but the anecdote I tell when people ask that is: When I was a kid, my sister and I — our parents were divorced — so we’d always be shuffling between houses, so the only kind of anchor point for us was every Saturday morning, we would watch cartoons and eat these sticks of honey … and that was always kind of a moment of homeostasis for me, so I thought that was a cool tone to embody with the band name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also didn’t want something that felt like it was kind of like tonally pigeonholing. Like, I didn’t want a name that was, like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edgy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or anything or was trying too hard to be cool … I liked something that was kind of like a non-sequitur.</span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of musical genre do The Honeysticks currently play into? </b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scanniello described the musical scene as “post-genre” and stressed it was hard to give The Honeysticks a definitive label, especially because of their plans to diversify their sound with their upcoming releases.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Scanniello: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially with some of the new stuff, there’s more playing with electronic elements which puts the music more somewhere in the umbrella of indie music.</span></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re ultimately an indie band, and right now [The Honeysticks] are trying some experiments with jazz and soul influences, with a little bit of funk in there, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I’m trying to figure out how to be a band that comes from an influencer background, while still being innovative artistically and not kind of just an influencer pop-project. We’re working towards a headier take on bedroom pop and a more kind of lush and organic way of expressing the same kinds of values found in that genre. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to pull a quick genre title from that explanation, I suppose.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ricky, you briefly mentioned this earlier, but you said you got started on our late, great social media site, Vine (Rest In Peace). How did you get started there? What kind of stuff did you do?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got Vine the day after the app launched in 2013, January 25th. I remember I first found the app because of a CNN article. I had just gotten an iPhone for the first time — I didn’t have a smartphone before then, so I was, like, obsessing over everything — like, I gotta get all the apps I can.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montgomery said he had been interested in the influencer scene before amassing a following on Vine, but that he saw Vine as a springboard for a possible music career. As an early adopter of the social media site, Montgomery readily accepted the opportunity to “define the narrative with the first wave of people using the app.”</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armed with a new following of followers to springboard his musical ventures, Montgomery used the opportunity to craft his musical and songwriting interests into a career, ultimately dropping out of college to take full advantage of the opportunity his Vine following gave him. </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Who are some of your musical influences? Who are you guys listening to, and how do they influence the music you tend to create or gravitate towards, if at all?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Right now, my favorite producer is JPEGMAFIA. I love JPEGMAFIA a lot. I also have been thinking with some of our songs a lot about the album “Trout Mask Replica” [by Captain Beefheart], and like a lot of old, like ‘70s stuff in particular — like Fleetwood Mac and I’m a little bit of jazz from that era. I feel like we’re also getting better as a band, so we’re trying to listen to more technically cool bands.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Band Members also tossed out their individual influences, citing musical groups like MGMT, BADBADNOTGOOD, Wiseblood, Yellow Days and further citing Carlos Santana as one of their strongest musical influences.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Honeysticks told the Nexus they enjoyed playing at Storke Plaza and now that they’ve recently acquired a van (nicknamed Carlos </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Van</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tana), they’re looking forward to touring in the near future after finishing their newest EP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no way [The Honeysticks] won’t come back to Santa Barbara,” they said, assuring the Nexus of their eventual return.

Backed with his signature jazzy piano, saxophone riffs and choir vocals, Chance the Rapper delivered another uplifting and soulful album that will please fans and critics alike.</p>\n<p>Is this Chance’s debut album? Well, sort of. He came into the game with three massively successful mixtapes, all of which were released for free to the public with him only making money off touring and selling merch. The first was the hilarious and touching “10 Day,” a tribute to the 10-day suspension he received for being caught with weed in high school. His next project, “Acid Rap,” was a game changer, with Chance addressing topics of drug addiction, losing friends to Chicago’s brutal streets and using music to cope with the harsh, unforgiving reality of being a black Chicagoan. This touching and sharply intelligent mixtape thrust him into the spotlight as one of Chicago’s newest and most unique MCs. He then proceeded to release the beautiful gospel-rap masterpiece, “Coloring Book,” a thoughtful and uplifting record that affirmed his Christian faith. Built on themes of family, community and love for one another, “Coloring Book” also went on to win a Grammy award for Best Rap Album.</p>\n<p>“The Big Day,” Chance’s latest album, follows up “Coloring Book” with yet another victory lap, designed to make everyone from your daughter to your grandpa smile and run out onto the dance floor. It’s a story of Chance’s wedding, telling the tale of a newly-married 27-year-old and a proud father transitioning to family life and dedicating himself to improving Chicago. It’s not as thematically cohesive or consistent as his previous works, as it feels less like an artistic statement and more like a wedding photo album. Nevertheless, it makes you smile enough to let that go.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens strong with “All Day Long,” a cheerful and hilarious track (backed by fantastic John Legend vocals) that sets the themes of the album: Chance’s fame, his family life and his love for his community. This is followed by the beautiful “Do You Remember,” a nostalgic ode to the endless childhood summers in which Chance reminisces over the journey he’s taken to get here. Once again, Chance delivers witty, hard-hitting lyricism backed by the vocals of the talented Benjamin Gibbard. The track feels like something straight out of Lupe Fiasco’s playbook: great lyricsm backed by star-studded background vocals (not surprising given that they both hail from Chicago and Lupe is a legend).</p>\n<p>This project also does a great job of highlighting Chance’s versatility as a rapper. In this album, he bounces through the jazzy opening track with an energetic and crazy flow then slows it down for tracks like “Eternal” and “Hot Shower.” His ability to use his voice and personality to command the vibe of any song has always been impressive, and it’s clear he’s aware of how talented he is.</p>\n<p>Chance is probably the only rapper ever to be this famous before his major label debut. If you look at the biggest hip-hop stars of today and yesterday, from Drake to Jay-Z to Kanye West to Kendrick Lamar, it’s hard to think of any that attained Chance’s level of fame before their major label debut. Chance handles his popularity with grace and a sense of humor, often cracking jokes and framing his social appeal as a deep bond with his fans and community rather than an all-encompassing fame-worship.</p>\n<p>While I enjoyed the message of this album and really like Chance as a person, I can’t help but feel that he’s lost some of the focus that made some of his earlier projects work so well. The thematic focus is fairly narrow, and that’s OK, but making the album 22 songs long seems excessive. In the era of streaming, the idea of an absurdly long tracklist seems to be commonplace, resulting in some tracks, such as “Ballin Flossin’” and “Slide Around,” being weaker and a little less effective than they could be.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a pretty solid album by Chance. Thematically, it doesn’t quite match up to the genius of “Coloring Book” or the hard-hitting honestly of “Acid Rap,” but it still stands on its own as a rite of passage for Chance into a new life of fatherhood, marriage and dedication. He succeeds in making an album that you can play in the car with your parents, play at your wedding reception or just vibe to as you cruise down the highway and think about life. It has something for everyone, and Chance doesn’t let his fans down in delivering music that is  funny, lighthearted and delightful, even if it isn’t quite Grammy-caliber material.</p>\n<p>7.5/10 – An enjoyable and funny listen not to be taken too seriously.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

types of rappers emerge like mumble rappers. YBN Cordae is one of those rappers to combine both lyrical and mumble rap to compose stories about women and his family, demonstrating his ability to integrate different aspects of rap into his music. He somehow embodies many older legendary rappers while still remaining characteristically similar to newer mumble rappers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YBN Cordae’s new album, “The Lost Boy,” shows his great mastery of music in a slightly different sector of rap than that of YBN Nahmir or YBN Almighty Jay, as his focus seems to be placed on lyrical formation over the more mumble-y rap of the others — it’s almost a little surprising that he’s even a part of the YBN group. However, this album shows that he can be, and is, a hugely successful solo rapper despite the growing popularity of the collective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stylistically, each song is a little different from the last. The album begins with the slow “Wintertime,” in which Cordae talks about his insecurities and the uphill battle he faces in becoming a young rapper, all over a beautiful saxophone beat.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suddenly, a few songs later, he displays his enthralling singing range on “Sweet Lawd,” a Chance the Rapper “Coloring Book”-type song. And then, of course, Chance the Rapper himself comes on in “Bad Idea,” a song that sounds more acid rap-like, with a slow, mellow beat and clever lyrics, bringing back the old Chance we all love. Cordae complements Chance extremely well with his smooth vocals over the sweet beat and raspy sound that both rappers possess.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s interesting how Cordae combines very genuine lyrics and important societal topics and offsets them with responses stated in the most not serious way possible. For example, in the song “Thousand Words,” he talks about the false reality of social media and the problems behind a screen, saying, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But no amount of likes can heal up all this pain that I’m feeling,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” but then continues the verse saying, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sittin’ on this phone for hours, feel my brain getting rotten</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I can give a fuck less, dawg, a ni**a is poppin’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these bitches that’s flockin’, shit, a ni**a got options.” He offsets his genuine tone about important topics with casual responses, a way of keeping his rap grounded to the masculinity it usually entails.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then comes the best song on the album —“RNP,” which shows Cordae’s ability to keep up with the revered Anderson .Paak and the contrasting style, as this song is very different from previous ones. The back-and-forth raps between Cordae and .Paak is truly incredible and shows that Cordae can easily keep up with rap legends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both across and within songs, the style constantly changes; he goes hard on “Broke as Fuck,” where immediately it sounds like another loud and trappy song, but then surprisingly slows down as he starts talking about his struggles of being a black male and dealing with mental issues. The way Cordae slows down this song shows how rappers are expected to be tough and hard, as the style of the song begins. However, as he begins talking about his struggles and mental health issues, the pace instantly changes and shows how rappers face these kinds of struggles despite being in a world of toxic masculinity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grandma’s House” is a very different song in the album; you definitely hear the narrative at this point through the gospel singing about home. This kind of reminds me of a song that would be on Kanye West’s “Late Registration,” with the insane vocals and familial feeling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my favorite songs on the album, “Lost &amp; Found,” is an interesting conclusion and sums up the album very well. It features a soulful beat paired with hard-hitting flow, bars on top of bars, endless love for family and clever rhymes, both serious and not. Cordae somehow combines usual rap topics of women and fashion with others such as family and his opinions on rap culture, even controversially calling “X, the Pac of his time.” Cordae doesn’t care what others think and raps for his own desire to express his opinions and create a platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I’ve constantly compared Cordae’s album to other rappers’ such as Chance and Kanye, this album signifies a huge turning point in his career, as he is becoming a lyrical storyteller through his many different approaches — some beats being soulful while others being hard and powerful. Through this, he talks about his family and mental issues, stylistically similar to how Chance made his start. He takes on this perspective of his predecessors but also combines it with a newer genre of rap, similar to Comethazine, Lil Mosey and Flipp Dinero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike many new albums nowadays, “The Lost Boy” doesn’t seem to be produced for commercial success, yet it also doesn’t sound like Cordae produced it drunk in his garage in the middle of the night. It also seems effortless, not like he spent every second thinking about each lyric and making it deep enough to be included. Instead, he braids funny, stupid lyrics with some well-thought-out and impactful verses. Ultimately, it’s interesting. Each song is just a little different from the previous, and he tackles on many different perspectives of rap with this new album.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

No matter how many designer brands you wear, it doesn’t guarantee your significant other will always be there for you — who would’ve thought?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">2. “Love Scars” – Trippie Redd</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not crying yet, Trippie’s echoey screeches combined with his deep lyrical ingenuity </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really makes you remember why you hate your ex. This song is nothing but relatable with lyrics like “You used to say you in love / Shawty you so fucked up / Shawty I don’t need you anyway / I just sit back in my Balenciagas.” If there’s anything to take away from this song, it’s that you should just forget your ex and go ball out on some new Balenciagas.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">1. “ball w/o you” – 21 Savage </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would be lying to you if I said I didn’t listen to this song on repeat when my boyfriend and I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">broke up. 21 Savage monotonously rapping on a smooth keyboard beat, who would’ve expected? The part that really hit me was his thirty-second-long, non-rhythmic cathartic outburst: “I’d rather have loyalty than love / ‘Cause love don’t really mean jack (Straight up) / See love is just a feeling / You can love somebody and still stab them in they back (Oh God).” It’s at that point you realize 21 Savage has emotions, and so do you, despite how much of a trap star you really are.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90023\" style=\"width: 593px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1810592053\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90020\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90023\" data-attachment-id=\"90023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/21-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?fit=1639%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1639,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?fit=820%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-90023\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?resize=583%2C729\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"729\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?w=1639&amp;ssl=1 1639w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?resize=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.jpg?resize=820%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 820w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Ralph Arvesen</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can’t all be downers though; some of us trappers finally found our soulmates — the Gucci to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your Louis, the Henny to your Coke. And when this happens, all we want to do is listen to some love songs, but not sappy Jason Mraz type of shit. Here are some of the best songs to listen to with your new boo when you feel love is in the air.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">4. “She Wanna Party” Feat. Millie Go Lightly – Young Thug </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one’s for all of my beautiful thugger girls, the ones who found their true loves or the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people out there who found their beautiful thugger girl. For those of you who have found your significant other, you probably understand when Thug says, “I love her so you know I got her flossin’ / I’m not a dentist but a n**ga flossin’.” I know we’re too busy to floss when we’re out here living life, but it’s worth it for your boo.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">3. “Fell in Luv” – Playboi Carti </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, Carti’s vocabulary may only range up to about 50 different words throughout the song, but the amount of times he says “Oh my God, I fell in love / I fell in love with the love” will nevertheless remind you how much you love your significant other. Because no matter how hard as fuck and independent you trappers are, it’s okay to be in love too.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">2. “Love Me” – Lil Tecca</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one’s for those of you in the beginning stages of the relationship; you’ve found the love of your life but you’re still chasing. Lil Tecca and his little 17-year-old self has never been more relatable, pouring his heart out singing, “Hope you know I want you, so do you want me? / If I said I love you, would you love me?” and then ends the song with “I’on think it’s for me.” I know we’re all only invested in our drip, but sometimes even the trappiest still fall in love. So for all of you who can’t believe this happened, embrace it with Lil Tecca.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">1. “You Da Baddest” Feat.. Nicki Minaj – Future </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never in my life would I have expected Future to write a love song — well, maybe about his love for lean, but definitely not for a woman — yet here we are. He finally found the one, the one who makes him sing, “We know you the baddest baby, fuck them hoes.” Big steps for Future, and big steps for all you trap lovers out there. Finally giving up the lifestyle for the one — now that’s true love.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90020\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90020\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-28/a-trap-music-guide-to-love-and-heartbreak/","id":6575,"author":{"id":661,"name":"Neha Makkapati"},"related":[6574,6573,6572],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
