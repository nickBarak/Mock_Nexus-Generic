Program Board. This year, The Warm Up featured electronic music artist TroyBoi and special guest JPEGMAFIA for their sold-out, Gauchos-only event in the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kicking off the show was rapper and producer Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks, also known as JPEGMAFIA (all caps, no spaces) or Peggy. JPEGMAFIA has grown from a small artist in the Baltimore D.I.Y. scene to a well-known musician working and touring all over the country with big-hitters like Vince Staples and Flume. Last year, JPEGMAFIA released his album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veteran</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which received rounds of praise and acclaim from popular music sites like Stereogum, Pitchfork and The Fader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During JPEG’s performance, Gauchos were presented with an exciting showcase of abrasive rap, an exciting lightshow and the stage antics of Peggy himself. Occasionally yelling along to the lyrics of his own songs, as seen in his performance of the song “Real Nega,” students in the crowd were easily able to engage themselves completely into the captivating performance. As JPEGMAFIA spat his lines, purple, blue and white lights waved around frantically in an amalgam of exciting visuals for students to enjoy. In case you missed JPEGMAFIA at The Warm Up, he will also be performing this year at Coachella.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Known for working with popular artists such as ZAYN, Missy Elliott and Danny Brown, TroyBoi has also released his own original tracks and albums, solidifying his role in the music scene as a whole. During his DJ set, Gauchos let loose as the crowd moved together in a symbiotic wave of chaotic dancing while songs new and familiar poured out of the thumping speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Troyboi performed original content, he also remixed popular tracks like “Bad and Boujee” by Migos, which clearly struck a chord with concertgoers and enabled them to engage with a revision of a staple Isla Vista party track. Similar to JPEG’s set, the lightshow accompanying Troyboi’s performance worked all the more to enhance the overall atmosphere. Meghan Leon, a third-year biology major, said, “The flashing lights and the loud music together just made the already great performance so much more extreme and fun.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87448\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"220346423\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87445\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87448\" data-attachment-id=\"87448\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/troyboi-and-jpegmafia-shake-the-thunderdome/the-warmup-2019_siavash-ghadiri_online-jpg-105-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1337&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1337\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Warmup 2019_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?fit=888%2C594&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87448\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?resize=888%2C594\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Warmup-2019_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE.jpg-105-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with A.S. Program Board Special Events Coordinator, Kailah Korsh, a fourth-year sociology major, I asked some questions regarding students’ interest in the booking processes and logistics of shows like The Warm Up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the fifth year of Delirium and The Warm Up, and we instituted these concerts in order to give students alternative programming that’s not necessarily just going to party in Isla Vista and also to deter out-of-towners coming because it’s a Gauchos-only event,” Korsh explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We chose those dates because there was some trouble like riots and just things going awry in the past,” she recalled, “so the administration thought it would be a really great thing, a super fun event for students to get to do where they don’t have to go out and be in any kind of unsafe environment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because there are a variety of artists to choose from for concerts like this, Korsh explained that the process of choosing one main headlining artist must be fairly discussed and agreed upon amongst all A.S. Program Board members, excluding the commissioner. “All the voting members, after a fair discussion, cast their vote and then the head talent booker or the talent booker for that show then takes that information and goes to the artist’s agent and the process continues from there,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a list of prospective music artists is formed, Korsh explains that they then, “reach out to major agencies that the artists belong to and then get availabilities from the artists and their asking prices, which are usually a general range of prices that they accept in order to do shows. So after that, we talk with the agent and talk about the feasibility of the show happening and then what happens is we send a formal offer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to discovering more about Program Board’s booking process, I wanted to know what it’s like getting to work with artists once the plans and contracts are finalized. While Korsh explained that it’s typically fun and exciting to work with famous musicians, she expressed how it can often be stressful due to unforeseen difficulties that arise no matter how well an event may be planned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The biggest thing I’ve learned from working directly with such big artists is that they’re just people and things happen that can go wrong,” Korsh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the experience of working with Troyboi and JPEGMAFIA specifically, Korsh said both were extremely excited to perform and more sociable than other artists she has worked with in the past. On working with musicians in general, Korsh elaborated, “Sometimes they’re super sociable, really great to work with, and sometimes they don’t really talk to us and just their manager does. It’s totally their call how involved they are with the students putting on the show, but I’ve had really great experiences my past three years on Program Board working with such big artists.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although one might think the chaos of our town’s party holiday might steer an organization away from the idea of planning a complex event like The Warm Up, this is actually a prime reason to have the annual show as a place for music lovers and party goers alike. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

artists to change their styles to make more money. Today, there are new means and opportunities awaiting artists’ effortless abilities to expand their musical talents. For some, it’s not about moving forward or making money with their music, but rather reflecting a sense of nostalgia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluto — no longer considered a planet — is also the pseudonym of one of the most influential artists in the hip-hop/rap industry today. If you’ve ever heard a young man in a song mumble, “I am Pluto,” then you have just heard the voice of Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a. Future, a rapper and songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia. His style envelopes a version of hip hop that he created himself, truly isolating himself from the mainstream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his many names, the man of the hour has just released his newest album on Jan. 18. Time after time, Future has brought back the heavy trap beats that he first started with, inducing an intense sense of jubilation. This new hip hop creation known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WIZRD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> captures Future’s most hidden and magical identity as his work induces an ultimate sense of nostalgia. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His alter identity, Pluto, transcends the listener, forcing you to separate yourself from your thoughts and surroundings, making the music your sole focus. It is as if you are on a planet of your own, perhaps even on the furthest and most barren of them all: Pluto. This new record is a step forward to a brighter future for us all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s dive into Future’s nostalgia together through the novel sounds that he traps us into with this classic album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first track on the album, “Never Stop,” is the most sentimental — especially when Future rhymes, “You can feel the pain when I’m rappin’ cause I’m ragin’/You can see my past and where I was on their faces.” It sets up the album as more of an introspective experience into the Wizrd’s soul, rather than just something to listen to. It brings you back to his 2015 mixtape days where the expression of his losses sets you up for the most intense of stories.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From then on, it’s like an adrenaline rush. Each track is a development of the cyclical nature of Future </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psyche, life, love, loss and most of all, sound. Tracks like, “Rocket Ship,” “F&amp;N,” “Talk S**t Like a Preacher,” “Promise U That” and “Stick to the Models” all elevate the mind and the soul. In all these cuts Future illustrates his life stories to show you how unstoppable he is and how unstoppable you can and will be if you just take a listen.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unicorn Purp” is one of the few songs on the album with a feature that includes Young Thug and Gunna. Not any artist gets to end up on an album with Future. His selection of features is very narrow, but that’s because not every voice fits into the aura of head-banging music that Future creates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel the crowd in your head as you blast his voice through your speakers, feeling your head bob like a maniac? That is the power of Future: to make you feel the insane need to be that crazy go-getter of a person that you’ve always wanted to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there’s “Temptation” and “Baptize,” but why bring these up as a separate entity from the rest? Because this Wizrd tries to play a trick on us all; he has no magical wand, just the realm of his musical imagination. The smallest yet most intricate patterns are woven into a melody of sounds not everyone may notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both “Temptation” and “Baptize” enclose warped soundtracks of two of Future’s classics. In “Temptation” the ending is actually the intro to one of his older songs, “Honest.” He is explicitly showing us that he wants us to recall the memories that he is trying to hold on to, the ultimate nostalgia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With “Baptize” comes a break in the lyrics where he uses the beat from another old hit, “Slave Master.” Future’s references in these two tracks gives a sense that his artistry is rooted in meaning, not just another hit to top the charts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time artists change, but Future has proven with yet another album that no one can change him or his music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven’t already, it’s time to immerse yourself into a track of songs that will not only bring you back to who Future really is, but will bring you back to remember what’s most important in your life. So go find your medium, whether that be music or writing, art or god knows what, and use your nostalgia as inspiration. Tell your story. The outcome might be pretty darn good, trust me. And if you don’t believe me, “go ask Tanya.” I’m just bein’ honest.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

jazz-fusion group Snarky Puppy performed in Santa Barbara for the first time after 12,000+ performances in six continents since their formation in 2004. Before the show, band leader and bassist Michael League gave a master class to UCSB’s Jazz Combo and students from San Marcos High School. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures announced the concert, I was thrown back to a memory of when I saw them at the 2016 Reno Jazz Festival. Their set was loud and flashy, splashed with bright purple lights and smoke. At the time, my knowledge of Snarky Puppy was limited to the benevolent ramblings of my high school jazz teacher who would exclaim his love for the group. In 2019, I finally  experienced this excitement for seeing them live that my teacher had three years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside the Granada Theater, the stage was illuminated with a gorgeous mix of purple, blue and magenta lighting. An array of curious instruments patiently sat on the stage; bongos, congas, an organ, a flute, two keyboards and more foreshadowed the craziness that would soon take place. Among the chitchat of anticipation, a mix of classic soul, funk and R&amp;B floated faintly in the background. The crowd was a blend of young and old jazz enthusiasts, all with glistens of bubbling eagerness in their eyes as “I Got You” by James Brown accompanied their chatter. Once the lights dimmed, I immediately sensed the aura of enthusiasm for what was to come. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snarky Puppy, comprised of 10 musicians, opened their set with a breathtaking percussion solo by Nate Werth. Slightly elevated above his band members under a single spotlight, Werth soloed as all eyes, including his bandmates’, focused on him. After a roar of applause, the group burst into their opening song, “Semente.” The wispy melody of flute juxtaposed the blaring horns and synths, creating a rock- and funk-filled atmosphere that captured the audience and welcomed them into the band’s eccentric world of music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They next played “Bigly Strictness” and “Chonks,” two songs from their upcoming album. Full of heavy synth bass, distortion and reverb, “Chonks” was instantly a crowd favorite. On the keys, Shaun Martin soloed over the booming bass with high-pitched riffs straight from outer space. He occasionally spoke the lyrics, “Chonks,” on beat into the microphone which invoked giggles every time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following song, “Thing of Gold,” the band took a more interactive approach. Martin secured lead as they neared the head of the song and questioned if the audience knew the iconic melody. The crowd responded quickly by shouting the nostalgic tune, their voices filling in the gap and becoming a part of the show. Martin ended the performance with an astonishing organ solo and entertained the audience by humorously incorporating “Amazing Grace” into his improvisation. One audience member yelled, “Preach!” as the rest erupted into laughter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning to their next song, League prefaced with a disclaimer for the track: “It’s kind of hard,” he said. Before counting off the band, League said, under his breath, “Okay, ready? Nope, me neither.” The incredible tune “Xavi” then took off with no caution, like a roller coaster let loose of its tracks. The flute made a return, only to be startled by the demanding and assertive presence of electric guitar. As the song progressed, the atmosphere became like a beehive, an organized chaos. The horns were unstoppable bustling bees on a mission, contradicting the rhythm section, a steady and intuitively accented buzz. The tension from the crowd anticipating a resolution to the chaos shifted to a massive roar of cheerful applause as the band members finished the journey and high-fived each other in a sigh of relief. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other highlights from the show included an astounding drum solo in their new song “Bad Kids To The Back” by Jason “JT” Thomas, who received a couple standing ovations. Watching Thomas skillfully play his instrument was like watching a blur: dozens of movements within seconds that could not be comprehended by an amateur but made perfect sense to its player. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snarky Puppy ended their set with the popular “Shofukan,” and an encore of “What About Me?” It was heartwarming to see the audience of all ages unify through the uncontrollable urge to groove along with the music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easygoing presence of Snarky Puppy — in their casual jeans and t-shirts talking and laughing with each other on stage and with the audience — contrasted the jazz and fostered an unforgettably intimate and otherworldly show. They captured the beauty of jazz: a confident, spontaneous, instinctive and passionate form of art that combines the musicianships of the group and individual self-expression, all while making it their own and having fun. For the audience to respond to the finale on their feet — clapping, raving, yelling, waving, throwing up “rock on” signs with their fists — was a sign of gratitude to Snarky Puppy for transporting them into their purple, blue, and magenta world for two hours on a Sunday night. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86811\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86811\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/snarky-puppy-makes-their-santa-barbara-debut/","id":6597,"author":{"id":684,"name":"Kelly He"},"related":[6596,6595,6594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Hi This Is Flume’ Arrives in Time for Spring","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2019-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pitchfork1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pitchfork1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the end, Hi This Is Flume speaks true to its name.

I was only 17 and still heavily invested in my indie and alternative roots, with bands like Arcade Fire and MGMT topping my personal list of must-see acts. As a young and naive festival-goer, I wasn’t too keen on checking out acts I was unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, I found myself with a gap between sets toward the end of Day 1 and decided to make the most of my time. So, I made my way to the nearest tent closest tent near me to pass the time.</p>\n<p>I found myself aimlessly stumbling into the darker and more intimate setting of Coachella’s Gobi Tent. It was then that I was introduced to Flume, hearing his track “Sleepless” for the first time. I had no idea who he was and had only managed to figure out his name after looking at my little booklet of set times, but what I do know is that whatever I was hearing, I liked it. I was instantly mesmerized by every weird and unfamiliar bit of sound I heard, so much so that I remained there for the next 30 minutes of his set.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“What is this?” I asked myself.</p>\n<p>Five years later and Flume has just released his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, a 17-track mixtape touting features from KUČKA, Eprom, JPEGMAFIA, SOPHIE, HWLS and slowthai and accompanied by a 42-minute-long visualizer directed by Jonathan Zawada. The Australian record producer, musician and DJ took to Instagram and Twitter earlier this month to announce the project, releasing it only a day laterin only a days time and breaking a painstaking two-year silence that has lasted since the release of the second companion EP to his Grammy award-winning album Skin in 2017.</p>\n<p>Flume, also known as Harley Streten, is notorious for consistently branching out into uncharted territory when it comes to his production. He is a pioneer in experimental electronic music and is largely responsible for launching the “future-bass” sound that dominates much of the mainstream music now. His sound design is an innovative and genre-blending mesh of sounds that one may not have ever heard before.</p>\n<p>Following his widely acclaimed Skin album in 2016, it’s hard to imagine how Flume could expand upon the weirdly alluring obscurities that make up his signature sound. When all has been watched and listened to, however, it’s evident that his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, stands as an even bigger career-defining moment in the scope of all things Flume.</p>\n<p>To my 17-year-old self, I’d confidently say, “This is Flume.”</p>\n<p>The mixtape opens up with an introductory “Hi, this is Flume” sample and transitions into a track titled “Ecdysis,” which quite literally is the process of shedding old skin among reptiles and insects. Metaphorically, this opening signals Flume’s own shedding of his “skin” — the evident narrative throughout the mixtape and visualizer. It’s a narrative of growth and moving forward, reaching newer and higher grounds.</p>\n<p>Filled with retro and hypnotic graphics among expansive landscapes, the visualizer accompanying the mixtape helps to guide audiences through this narrative journey Flume embarkssets out on. It’s psychedelic and trippy and helps accentuate every feature of the mixtape and its seamless transitions from track to track.</p>\n<p>Standout tracks in the first half include “Jewel” and “Dreamtime.” Both are somewhat reminiscent of the sounds in Flume’s prior work, particularly those in the two companion EPs to Skin. They’re nostalgic in nature and indicative of the mellow flow and glitchy sounds that helped propel Flume into the global spotlight, but still with new and heavier twists to them. The first run of tracks culminate in Flume and Eprom’s remix of SOPHIE’s “Is It Cold In The Water?” and builds on SOPHIE’s already ethereal and hyperreal sound.</p>\n<p>After several minutes of following Flume in his tie-dye kimono on his trek through the desert, the mixtape and visualizer pauses with a three-minute silence during which he is seen pumping gas late at night at an empty gas station. Then, it immediately transitions into “How To Build a Relationship,” featuring a strong and powerful verse from rapper JPEGMAFIA.</p>\n<p>This is where the real action of the project picks up — even fresher and newer sounds are poured into this side of the tape. “Wormhole,” for instance, is the most telling of all in terms of Flume’s growth and experimentation as a producer. It presents to listeners a seemingly random conglomeration of almost unbearable, loud noises until it bleeds into “Voices,” with appearances from SOPHIE and KUČKA. In “Voices,” we hear the same bashing of sounds, although in a much more fascinating way that’s layered beneath the vocals.</p>\n<p>“MUD” and “Upgrade” follow these tracks as an even more impressive pair of the strangely entrancing mixture of sounds Flume uses in his productions.<br>\nBut perhaps the best run of tracks is the 10 or so minutes engulfed by Tracks 13-17, from “71m3” to “Spring.” The visualizer shows Flume seeing double of himself, driving in circles and even burying himself in the sand. It’s a psychedelic realization and rebirth, quite literally depicted in this part of the visualizer and through the wonky, hard-soft melodies that bring these tracks together.</p>\n<p>In the end, Hi This Is Flume speaks true to its name. This is what Flume is. It’s the raw and organic feeling of hearing a sound for the very first time. It’s the discovery of something new — something you never knew you needed, until you did. It’s that feeling my 17-year-old self was overcome by when hearing the oddities of Flume’s production for the very first time and being strangely drawn to it because of its fresh and authentic nature.</p>\n<p>Hi This Is Flume is a mesmerizing testament to the process of discovery, growth and continuation. Whether it be in his personal life or creative processes, Flume is, and continues to be, a confident stride into the unknown. His originality as a producer is quite possibly what leads others to flock to his side, and not knowing what will come next perpetually leaves fans on their toes.</p>\n<p>What has always fascinated me about the electronic music genre is how electronic artists and producers are continually able to push the musical landscape, challenging traditional conceptions of what music is and what it ought to sound like. Throughout his career and especially through his new project, Flume has exemplified this to a tee, proving that music can and should be a continually progressive phenomenon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/hi-this-is-flume-arrives-in-time-for-spring/","id":6598,"author":{"id":685,"name":"Austin Fauni"},"related":[6597,6596,6595],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
