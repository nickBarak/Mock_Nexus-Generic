","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Community Services District Vice President Natalie Jordan resigned from her position on the Board effective early January, leaving the Board with a vacant seat and no female representation.</p>\n<p>Jordan’s resignation comes short of her official two-year term, which was initially delayed after elections due to technicalities in elections code. The delay in the start of her term would have meant that Jordan would serve for longer than the two-year term, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was time for someone else to step into that position as I’m finishing up grad school in the next couple months and most likely will be taking career opportunities in a different location,” Jordan said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70006\" style=\"width: 812px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"729574540\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85529\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70006\" data-attachment-id=\"70006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/as-candidate-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=3399%2C4339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3399,4339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Natalie Jordan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=802%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-70006\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5-802x1024.jpg?resize=802%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=802%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1 196w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=768%2C980&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jordan left her job late last year. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>Jordan, who is set to obtain her masters in technology management from UC Santa Barbara this spring, looks back on the past two years in her position and the challenges, accomplishments and change she has seen along the way.</p>\n<p>“Walking into it, I didn’t really know what it was going to be because we were shaping it,” Jordan said. “I think that it was just more than I could have ever thought or expected to have. It’s a truly amazing experience and I’m blessed to have had it.”</p>\n<p>Jordan’s campaign in 2016 for a position on the Board focused on increasing safety in Isla Vista through securing more street lighting and parking for residents. Now, she says the past two years in her role were more about working with other board members to create the foundation of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and define its role for the public.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of it for me, was making sure that we were able to kind of set a precedent of what it meant to be on the Isla Vista Community Services District and setting a tone for the community as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Jordan participated in the CSD’s policy committee, which created governing documents for the functioning and mechanics of the Board as well as its interactions with the public and media.</p>\n<p>These policies helped to build the “baseline” for CSD’s growth and efficiency in the future, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>While Jordan says the CSD has made progress toward increasing safety in Isla Vista, lighting and parking projects never came into full fruition during her term.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD organized lighting walks and began discussion on lighting in I.V., but there is still work to be done before the community will enjoy additional lighting in the area, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>Increasing parking in I.V. also required a more lengthy and tedious process than anticipated, but as with lighting, Jordan hopes it will continue to be a priority for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s still a pressing need for our community but should be set as a long term goal,” Jordan said. “I think there are a lot of solutions to kind of take that on.”</p>\n<p>Among the accomplishments made toward increasing safety in the community, Jordan cited the collaboration made with UC Police Department for safety stations in I.V. and the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator as steps toward her overall term goals.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman on the board, Jordan said her perspective helped to shed light on safety concerns and issues faced by women in Isla Vista including sexual assault, catcalling and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“Of course I can’t speak for all women in any circumstance but I think the perspective I have as a woman in Isla Vista is really imperative… and being able to address those [concerns] from my perspective I think was really important and important for the board and our community to hear and understand,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Now that the board is without a female member, Jordan hopes that women in the community will pursue the opportunity to get involved with the board.</p>\n<p>“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also noted that her “frankness and honesty” during board meetings allowed her to contribute unique perspectives to discussions.</p>\n<p>“I’m never afraid to really speak my mind. I think that that’s a big part of what I brought to the board… a perspective that I had as a student, as a first-generation college student and a resident of Isla Vista,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Throughout her term, Jordan at times struggled to effectively divide roles and responsibilities among board directors, a challenge which she attributes to the initiative demonstrated by board directors.</p>\n<p>“I think all of us on the board are natural leaders and… everyone wants to take on as much as they can but I think being able to have us all kind of share in that responsibility is a really big part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, Jordan at times arrived late and left I.V. CSD Board meetings early or failed to show up at all, according to <i>Nexus </i>reporters who regularly attend the I.V. CSD meetings.</p>\n<p>Jordan said her absences were due to conflicts with her job as an event coordinator. When her work conflicted with I.V. CSD meetings, Jordan was obligated to attend her paying job over the meetings, which Board directors only began getting paid for last November.</p>\n<p>“I was responsible for paying for my own tuition, which is a big issue so as a full-time student I was also working around 55 hours a week,” Jordan said. “At the end of the day, I needed to make sure that I could pay for my school, which is the reason that I was here in Isla Vista in the first place.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During her term, Jordan oriented herself more toward university players and issues, but said that I.V. CSD could have benefitted from her developing more relationships with stakeholders in I.V. as well.</p>\n<p>“I was much more involved with university politics than I was more local and state, so I think that learning more about those key players and how I could’ve contributed to those conversations would have been meaningful to the board,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she fulfilled her role on the board to the best of her ability despite these difficulties. Overall, she said she is proud of the work she did while serving on the Board.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Jordan advises that the I.V. CSD maintains their obligation to the community as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“I think the only thing that we should be concerned about is continuing to serve the community and just always keeping that as our guiding force,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jordan believes the past two years have set up the board for success in the future.</p>\n<p>“I have very high hopes that this inaugural board was precedent setting for expectations for board members for years to come and also in creating relationships with community members and truly being a representative government.”</p>\n<p>For the next I.V. CSD Vice President, Jordan said that being open to the opinions and suggestions of others is vital to the position.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is coming into it with their own unique perspectives and everyone is coming into it with what they feel is the right thing to do,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Hearing people out is the most important thing you can do [when] trying to make an educated decision.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also said that I.V. CSD needs a vice president with a strong resolve and commitment to the community.</p>\n<p>“Somebody who [has] got a can-do attitude and has a little bit of grit. That’s what we need in Isla Vista. Somebody with grit and a willingness to get it done at all costs,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>After completing her master’s degree this June, Jordan hopes to obtain a job that provides her with the same motivation she found while serving on the I.V. CSD Board.</p>\n<p>“Being able to find a career that still gives me that meaning and driving force and willingness to go to work everyday is really important,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that eventually I’m able to come back to something like a local elected position because I really found a lot of purpose and meaning in that job as well.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1:07 p.m.]: An earlier version of this article said there were three empty seats on the board.

Santa Barbara then made more history as it set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home at 15 after defeating Hawaii on April 30. It would go on to win 17 straight at home before losing to Cal State Bakersfield 5-4, dropping them to 31-13-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 17, UCSB successfully swept UCLA for the first time since the 2006 season after defeating the Bruins 4-3 at their own place. Riding that momentum, Santa Barbara went on to win two of three at UC Irvine, its first series victory at Irvine since 1986. The Gauchos finished the regular season 37-18-1 earning them the No. 2 seed in the Nashville Regional. Due to a great regular season, eight UCSB athletes were named to All-Big West teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos opened postseason play with a bang to say the least as with their backs against the wall in the bottom of the 12th inning down 2-1, redshirt junior Devon Gradford made the biggest play of his career hitting a solo home run to tie the game at two.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71720\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71720\" data-attachment-id=\"71720\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-18/ucsb-ready-to-take-center-stage-at-first-college-world-series/clm_exnvaaajpue/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71720\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?resize=335%2C223\" alt=\"Commencing ceremonies at Omaha / Photo Courtesy of @NCAACWS on Twitter\" width=\"335\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ClM_EXnVAAAJpuE.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Commencing ceremonies at Omaha / Photo Courtesy of @NCAACWS on Twitter</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outfielder had a tremendous season having the best batting average on the team (.331), and the second best on-base percentage (.412) and slugging percentage (.454) while also earning All-Big West Honorable Mention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Austin Bush then won the game in the 14th inning with a walk-off home run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first baseman had an amazing season of his own, leading his team in home runs (11) and hitting one home run in each of his first four postseason games. Bush was named MVP of the Nashville Regional once all was said and done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After defeating Washington in the opening round of the Nashville Regional, UCSB went on to defeat Xavier twice to reach its first Super Regional in program history. There, Santa Barbara drew Louisville, a 50-win team. While it seemed destined that the Gauchos season would end there, the players had something to say about that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a stunning 4-2 upset by UCSB in the first of a three-game series, the Cardinals, led by pitcher Drew Harrington, came out firing in game two taking a 3-0 lead into the final inning. Down to its last three outs, Santa Barbara’s storybook season continued as, with the bases loaded, pinch hitter Sam Cohen, a freshman back-up catcher, hit a walk-off grand slam to send Louisville home and the Gauchos to Omaha.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is real…</p>\n<p>A walk-off GRAND SLAM to go to Omaha by UC Santa Barbara's Sam Cohen! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CWS</a><a href=\"https://t.co/avSzj06I9t\">https://t.co/avSzj06I9t</a></p>\n<p>— NCAA Baseball (@NCAACWS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS/status/742073445203087361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos reaching the College World Series was a dream come true for everyone involved. Something that most fans never thought they would see, was happening in front of their very eyes. UCSB did not go to far at Omaha as it lost its opening match against Oklahoma State 1-0. After eliminating Miami and keeping their championship hopes alive, however, Arizona eliminated Santa Barbara a few days late, ,ending its season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It truly was a spectacular season for the Gauchos, not just from a winning standpoint but for the athletes involved as well. Junior pitcher Shane Bieber, a first team All-Big West, was drafted in the fourth round by Cleveland after a spectacular season in which he had a 2.74 ERA, 109 strikeouts, second best in the conference and a career-high 12 victories.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71725\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71725\" data-attachment-id=\"71725\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-19/gauchos-shutout-in-opening-round-of-college-world-series/osu-vs-ucsb-30/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/OSU-vs-UCSB-30.jpg?fit=3881%2C2911&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3881,2911\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"OSU vs UCSB 30\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/OSU-vs-UCSB-30.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/OSU-vs-UCSB-30.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71725\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/OSU-vs-UCSB-30.jpg?resize=270%2C202\" alt=\"Junior Shane Bieber pitched a complete game allowing only six hits and one run is the Gauchos loss.

O’Colly / Devin Wilber</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable players included redshirt sophomore second baseman JJ Muno who led the team in hits with 68 and batted a solid .294. Redshirt junior Andrew Calica also had a great final season at UCSB batting .252 from the plate, leading the team in OBP (.427) and finishing with the most hit by pitches in school history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomores pitcher Kyle Nelson and shortstop Clay Fisher, were invited to the Collegiate National Team Trials. Fisher is known as one of the best defensive shortstops in the country while Nelson is known as one of the best pitchers, registering seven wins and 10 saves on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the Gauchos have a bunch to look forward to. Most of their star field players will be returning for next season with the exception of Calica, who was picked by Cleveland in the 11th round. This was the second time the Indians selected him as, straight out of high school, Cleveland picked him in the 17th round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What UCSB will have to replace is pitching as, along with the loss of Bieber, redshirt junior right-handers James Carter and Trevor Bettancourt both left to the MLB and as did redshirt senior Justin Kelly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, with all that being said, the Gauchos still have a very bright future. Thanks to their strong staff and one of the best head coaches in the country in Checketts, UCSB has created a winning culture at Santa Barbara and one that many great athletes will want to come and thrive in.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Both players were drafted by the Indians in the MLB June draft earlier this summer. Other notable losses for UCSB are pitchers James Carter, Justin Kelly, and Trevor Bettancourt.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While replacing top talent can be a difficult thing, it is made easier with the knowledge that solid and even better talent will be walking in the door ready to step into the limelight of UCSB baseball.</p>\n<p>Recruiting great athletes is something Checketts has done throughout his tenure here in Santa Barbara with his most rich class coming in 2012, which included amazing players such as Calica, and pitcher Dillion Tate who was selected fourth overall in the 2015 MLB Draft by the Texas Rangers.</p>\n<p>This top-10 recruiting class marks the fourth time in five years Checketts has delivered a nationally recruited class. Helping the Head Coach in recruiting affairs are assistant coach/recruiting coordinator Eddie Cornejo and assistant coach Neil Walton.</p>\n<p>This No. 9 class includes 16 new faces and five pitchers, something the Gauchos definitely need to recuperate in after losing four this offseason.</p>\n<p>The most promising of the newcomers is quite possibly Chris Lincoln, a 6’4 right-handed pitcher from Rancho Verde High School in Moreno, Calif. who turned down a contract from the Toronto Blue Jays despite being selected in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>“It was tough [deciding between MLB or UCSB], there were a lot of factors that went into it,” Lincoln said. “Ultimately, one of the things that persuaded me was the coaching staff and great head coach. I knew I was coming to a winning team that would help me grow as a player.”</p>\n<p>Lincoln was a tremendous high school pitcher as he had a 2.23 season ERA along with 66 strikeouts in only 59 innings pitched. During his three years on his varsity baseball team, Chris accumulated a 2.92 ERA and 181 Ks in 40 appearances in which 27 of those were starts. But even before his excellent senior campaign, Lincoln signed with UCSB during his junior year on Nov. 13 of 2015.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I knew where I was going put a lot of pressure off of me and I was glad I knew where I wanted to go after high school,” Lincoln said. “This is a wonderful, top notch school and a great environment to play.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Lincoln is not the only incoming Gaucho who had an amazing stat line. Left-hander Ben Brecht was also an amazing pitcher in high school especially during his senior year when he went 8-0 with a 0.31 ERA in 44 innings pitched and 74 strikeouts. The Chicago native was First Team All-State and was selected in the 36th round by the Baltimore Orioles.</p>\n<p>Both these players will be mentored by some of the best collegiate baseball players in the country including guys like junior J.J. Muno who was a sparkplug for UCSB, and junior power hitter Austin Bush.</p>\n<p>“Everyone on the team has been great. All the upperclassmen help us really well and make sure we become great, I love it.” Lincoln said.</p>\n<p>The final thing the Gauchos did this offseason to solidify the success this team will have in the future is the extension given to Checketts which now puts him through 2022.</p>\n<p>With fresh talent set to come in, great athletes still left on the roster from last years’ College World Series run and a well put together coaching staff kept in place, the 2016-17 UCSB baseball team will definitely be a team to watch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

focused on making Greek life more sustainable – was founded less than a year ago, according Kappa Alpha Theta member Miranda de Moraes, a third-year sociology and philosophy major.</p>\n<p>The organization is currently operated by two co-presidents: de Moraes and Dean Narlock, a third-year computer science major and Sigma Pi member.</p>\n<p>The farmer’s market, held between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m., featured a handful of campus organizations and local businesses from the greater Santa Barbara area: Blue Ridge Honey, I.V. Food Co-op, I.V. Trading Post, the Climate Reality Project, I.V. Surfrider and the Program for Assessment and Certification for the Environment and Sustainability (P.A.C.E.S).</p>\n<p>Some served various types of food, while others showed off art pieces and live music; all promoted “eating environmentally” and environmentally conscious attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to educate anyone [who came to our] event on how to choose your foods, whether you’re at the grocery store or a farmer’s market, and know the story behind everything you buy,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>De Moraes said the organization was first created to address the lack of sustainable practices in Greek life at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Greek life is a massive organization of people, and unless environmentalism is a top priority, it will inevitably generate a lot of waste due to the number of people involved,” she said.</p>\n<p>Greeks Go Green is officially recognized by UCSB due to its sponsorship by the Inter-Greek Council, allowing it to have its own budget, according to de Moraes.</p>\n<p>It is also entirely supported through donations and fundraisers, she said.</p>\n<p>“We did a restoration project with [the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration] and were able to raise $200 dollars from that by planting native plants and eradicating invasive ones,” de Moraes said.</p>\n<p>Projects generally take place within Greek life houses, focusing on sustainable practices such as “getting compost and recycling bins in the houses or reducing the use of styrofoam in the kitchens,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>According to Narlock, Greeks Go Green is divided into two subcommittees – projects and events – that plan accordingly in respect to the organization’s quarterly theme. This quarter’s theme was sustainable food consumption, promoted through Sunday’s event.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85279\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85279\" data-attachment-id=\"85279\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/greeks-go-green-hosts-farmers-market-promotes-environmentally-sustainable-practices/img_1990/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=1280%2C853&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,853\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_1990\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85279\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85279\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event also featured live music. Courtesy<em> of Nolan Fuss</em></p></div>\n<p>Narlock added that Sunday’s event was planned by the core executive council as well as the events committee.</p>\n<p>Last quarter, the organization’s focus was “on sustainable fashion,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with I.V. Trading Post to hold an inter-Greek clothing swap that was open to the community,” he said.</p>\n<p>De Mores noted that between 400 and 600 pieces of clothing were diverted from landfills simply through small donations during the event.</p>\n<p>Although relatively new, Greeks Go Green has made significant progress in making Greek life and Greek housing more sustainable with their composting project, de Mores said.</p>\n<p>For example, Greeks Go Green collaborated with Marborg Industries to create a food scrap collection program. She added that the goal of the program is to divert scraps and waste from participating chapter kitchens and turn it into mulch rather than trash.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to implement a food scrap collection program in several chapter kitchens, which is a big deal because around 40 people live in each chapter house. In most of them, there is a chef or kitchen staff of some sort that’s preparing the food for everyone in the house,” she said.</p>\n<p>“That staff is now diverting those pre-consumer food scraps from landfills by using this food scrap collection program we’ve implemented with Marborg, which is the county’s trash collection service. That compost is going to local orchards and farms in the area in the form of mulch.”</p>\n<p>The addition of a sustainability chair in all Greek houses, another key success to Greeks Go Green, provides each chapter with the opportunity and power to make changes regarding its environmental impact, Narlock said.</p>\n<p>In the future, he hopes to see a growth in support of Greeks Go Green with the addition of younger members to continue to promote environmental awareness after he and de Mores graduate.</p>\n<p>“Our big push through this year is getting some young energy involved in our group. Miranda and I are both juniors, so getting freshman and sophomores involved once we graduate is going to be a key focus for us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
