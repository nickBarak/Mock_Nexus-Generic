It’s time to embrace contraction. The talent pool has become too diluted and there are too many teams that are losing money, forcing the richer teams to prop up their poorer cousins via revenue sharing. There’s a simple, albeit practically and politically difficult, solution to both problems: contraction.</p>\n<p>There are currently 30 teams in the NBA. That’s the same as the MLB and two less than the NFL, so it’s not a large number in the American sports context. That said, it’s still too many. With 30 teams in the league competing for talent, what results is a massive inequality in talent. Simply put, there aren’t enough superstars or even just normal stars available for every team to be competitive.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a result, we get teams like the Warriors and the Rockets, with gluts of stars, competing against teams like the Hawks and the Cavaliers, with not a competent NBA starter in sight. Fewer teams would eliminate, or at least reduce, the number of unequal matchups in the NBA. The talent pool would stay the same while the number of teams competing for that talent pool would decrease, leading to talent spreading more evenly throughout the league.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple argument: Fewer teams means a more balanced league. What’s not so simple is the question of which teams get contracted. No one is going to volunteer to step up to the chopping block, after all. That’s where the revenue issue comes in.</p>\n<p>According to a 2017 ESPN report, 14 NBA teams lose money. The revenue-sharing system, however, takes some of the profits from the other 16 teams and spreads them out through the league to mitigate this issue. After these payouts, there are nine teams that spend more than they take in through revenue.</p>\n<p>Those nine teams are the Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Memphis Grizzlies, Milwaukee Bucks, Orlando Magic, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards. Those teams constitute our chopping block. If an NBA team is unprofitable even after it gets money from the rest of the league, it’s not a sustainable operation.</p>\n<p>We can trim that list down for regional reasons and arrive at a final list of six teams destined for contraction: the Nets, Hawks, Cavaliers, Bucks, Magic and Spurs. One of the first things that jumps out about that list is how Eastern Conference-heavy it is. After contraction, we’re left with 10 teams in the East and 14 in the West. There’s an easy fix: Move the New Orleans Pelicans and the Memphis Grizzlies to the East and we’re back at an even split of 12 each.</p>\n<p>This won’t be easy or uncontroversial by any means. There are, after all, plenty of Spurs, Bucks and maybe even Magic fans that won’t simply accept the disappearance of their favorite team. But for each team on that list, there’s a nearby alternative option. I’m not saying that glibly; I know that no Spurs fan is going to jump right to the Rockets or the Mavericks. After a few years, though, when passions have faded, we’ll see how things lie. Even if those fans don’t return, well, they weren’t exactly keeping their teams profitable in the first place.</p>\n<p>Some people might object to using profitability as the arbiter of life and death in the future NBA. In all honesty, I’m not entirely comfortable in using such a soulless, capitalist benchmark. The issue is that there aren’t any better options for solving these pressing issues.</p>\n<p>We can’t simply contract teams that are and have been bad. Talent fluctuates a lot more than revenue. Put in another way, players come and go but markets are much more stable. Anyway, contracting along those lines would take out my Sacramento Kings, and I can’t have that.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that there’s a better method of contraction. If there is, I’m open to hearing it. The fact is, however, that the NBA needs contraction.</p>\n<p>The superteam era has spawned an entire sub-industry of NBA takes on how to create a measure of parity in the league. What I’m arguing is that the way to combat superteams is to lean into them. There’s no such thing as a superteam when every team is a superteam. Not only would my contraction system combat superteam-ism, it would also be profitable for the league. By eliminating the teams that are losing money, the NBA would be able to reduce its revenue-sharing system, keeping more money in the pockets of the remaining teams.</p>\n<p>Reducing the number of teams to 24 will improve the quality of play and reduce the number of teams losing money, all while making sure that every fan in every part of the country has a regional team to root for. The NBA doesn’t want to contract, but it needs to do it anyway.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

which gives students an understanding behind the processes important to the climate system. <em>Nexus file photo </em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Patty Murray, the undergraduate advisor for the geography department, approximately five or six students switch into the geography major every quarter. The new emphasis fills a gap in the major, according to Murray, so geography students interested in oceanography now can focus on the physical aspects of marine science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was no major on campus that focused on [that],” said Timothy DeVries, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, who helped to create the new emphasis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ocean plays a huge role in the Earth’s climate systems, so understanding ocean science is crucial for understanding the causes and effects of climate change,” DeVries added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new emphasis focuses on the fundamental aspects of the way the ocean works, which gives students an understanding behind the processes important to the climate system, according to DeVries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murray said that many students across several departments had expressed interest in the emphasis after taking a popular physical oceanography class that UCSB offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just for that one class, physical oceanography, the interest is there from many students in many different departments who are looking for that particular course knowledge,” Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ll have students come from other majors and say, ‘I wish I had discovered this major earlier.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new emphasis requires one upper-division class in physical oceanography, three classes focusing on oceanography and marine systems and three classes focused on climate and earth system science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lower-division requirements are the same as for the regular geography bachelor of science, which includes classes such as physics, chemistry, math and lower-division geography courses, according to DeVries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for this emphasis to be recognized, it had to go through an extensive approval process, beginning with the creation of a new major sheet, Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our upper-division classes for this degree emphasis were redesigned specifically to encompass oceanography, climate and earth systems, geographical techniques and statistical analysis. And all of those areas had to be defined specifically with the applicable courses on the new major sheet. So that was done departmentally,” Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the department created the degree emphasis, faculty in both the geography department and external departments such as marine biology and earth science took a vote to approve it, Murray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After emphasis was approved by both the geography department chairs and department faculty, it was submitted to the College of Letters and Science, who looked over the major to see if it met the college’s standards for major sheets and majors, Murray said. Afterward, it went to final approval with the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So, in all, we probably spent about a year preparing with all the approval processes that we had to go through and then we were first able to offer this fall of 2019,” Murray said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murray hopes that the new emphasis will attract a wide variety of students. “We’re sort of shouting it from the rooftops,” Murray said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-17/geography-department-offers-new-emphasis-in-ocean-science/","id":3346,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[3345,3344,3343],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Food Security Advising Center Moves Into Former Kaplan Center Space","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-12-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KAPLAN_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KAPLAN_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Plans are in place to have a grand opening in January with students, staff and faculty to celebrate the new space.

Plans are in place to have a grand opening in January with students, staff and faculty to celebrate the new space, according to Katie Maynard, sustainability coordinator for the UCSB Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising center offers the assistance of Peer Advisors on Food Security and CalFresh Advocates; the advisors and advocates are peer mentors who “can advise students on resources related to food security, housing security, and other programs to help students in meeting their basic needs,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff at the center can also help students apply for the CalFresh Program, a federally funded program designed to help low-income individuals “add to their budget to put healthy and nutritious food on the table,” according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full list of stores where CalFresh benefits are accepted, including the Arbor and most grocery stores, can be found on the Food Security and CalFresh Advocates </span><a href=\"http://food.ucsb.edu/calfresh\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said the center and its staff are funded through two sources: the State General Fund and  a subcontract from </span><a href=\"https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/higher-ed-subcontractors.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSU Chico</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps support UCSB’s CalFresh program. However, the funding for the center’s physical space comes from UCSB’s Department of Geography, according to Gary Lawrence, director for University Center and Events Center administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said he was first contacted about the vacant space by Melissa Fontaine, the geography department’s food security coordinator, on July 3, Maynard and Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services and member of the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Their goal] fit with the AS Food Bank and their mission to address the food security issues of UCSB students,” Lawrence said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease agreement was signed on Sept. 23 and extends through June 20, 2020; the Department of Department agreed to pay $3 per square foot, for a total of $1230 per month for 410 square feet. When the private office in the space – </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently occupied</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE) – becomes available, the space will increase by 80 square feet, increasing the cost to $1470 per month, according to Lawrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location offers a lot of student traffic, along with “close proximity” to other student services already in the UCen such as the Associated Students Food Bank and the Community Housing Office, Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This location allows us to co-locate our services in a central place that is easy for students to access,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

I appreciate his brand of basketball and all the hardships he has faced to get to where he is. I was not fond of his move to Miami, but other than that, the King has proven himself to be a very admirable person on and off the court.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71745\" style=\"width: 353px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71745\" data-attachment-id=\"71745\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/more-than-a-loss/gty-476489226-s-spo-bko-bkn-usa-oh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=1000%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,694\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"GTY 476489226 S SPO BKO BKN USA OH\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=250%2C174&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?fit=888%2C616&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71745\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gty_476489226_73676464.jpg?resize=343%2C238\" alt=\"After averaging 30.1 ppg in the regular season, Curry only managed 22.6 ppg in the Finals.

Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>So when I took the stance that Curry was the best player in the NBA now, it was not out of spite, it was out of the true belief that I thought No. 30 for the Warriors was the best player.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure he couldn’t rebound or even pass like LeBron, but Steph’s brand of basketball is so much more special than that; it was something the league had never seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before this season, no player in NBA history made 300 three-pointers in a single season; Steph made 402. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry averaged 30.1points per game, the best in the league this season. A huge part of that is the deadly three ball he possesses. No player or team, for that matter, was able to drain the three ball as consistent as the two-time MVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he also joined the illustrious 50-40-90 club (50 percent shooting from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He isn’t LeBron, he will never be LeBron, but he was revolutionizing the game before our very eyes — something not even King James could ever do. He was so good that there were talks that a four-point line should be added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, Curry is clutch — or at least was before this NBA Finals — and has made big shots during his career, I mean, who could forget the shot that broke Oklahoma City’s heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, Curry went on to break the hearts of all Golden State fans in the game’s biggest stage: the NBA Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry was a disappointment in the Finals, to say the least. If you take out game four where he dropped 38, the NBA’s first unanimous MVP averaged 20 points per game, 10 points below his regular season average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in the biggest game of his career, a game seven at Oracle arena, No. 30 went 6-19 from the field, 4-14 from three, for a mere 17 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention he had four turnovers, including a boneheaded, unnecessary behind the back pass that went out of bounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also was a big believer that even though LeBron was a way better defender than Curry, the fact is the NBA and its rules are geared toward offense. The art of true defending in the NBA has gone down a significant amount, so I was not going to hold that against Steph.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And Steph’s offense has been so explosive, it can overshadow his, at times, lackluster defense. Plus, he did lead the league in steals (2.1) so at the very least he tries to run around and disrupt plays.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71746\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71746\" data-attachment-id=\"71746\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/more-than-a-loss/636020081040379218-usatsi-9349709/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"534,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?fit=534%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71746\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=280%2C210\" alt=\"Kyrie Irving's three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"280\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/636020081040379218-USATSI-9349709.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kyrie Irving’s three over Steph Curry with 53 seconds left proved to be the shot that won the championship for the Cavs. Kelley L Cox / USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at the end of game seven, it felt only fitting that the final bucket, scored by Kyrie Irving, came against Stephen Curry, who they had taken advantage of all series. His offensive game couldn’t make up for his defense and it cost him. Not just a game, it cost him a ring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is the MVP came up small on the biggest stage. I don’t want to imply Curry is overrated and has been lucky to this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph is still great, but he is not the best player in the NBA and he isn’t what we thought he was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the seven-second Phoenix Suns, it feels like the Cavs, and now the rest of the league figured out how to defend and get the best of him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, it’s possible Curry still could’ve been hurt, but that is no excuse. It’s game seven, you either show up, or you don’t, and he didn’t. </span>To his credit, Curry never once went to his injury as an excuse and even praised LeBron and the Cavs after their game seven victory at Oracle.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that Steph deserved his MVP trophy, 400 three’s speak for themselves. But now, there is also no doubt who the NBA’s best player is. For those who still continue to hate, and doubt the King, keep doing so, but it won’t change the fact he is the league’s most dominant player.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
