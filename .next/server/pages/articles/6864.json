A spirited crowd of old-school rap fans gathered at Velvet Jones for an intimate performance that left everyone’s party urges fully satiated. Nickatina is well past his prime, yet he successfully drew a respectable crowd of students, locals and even a few groupies. The rapper’s supporters craved a night of celebration, which he surely delivered.</p>\n<p>Nickatina’s performance opened with the very important question: “Where all my weed smokers at?” From the very beginning he displayed a sense of appreciation and understanding for his demographic. The crowd roared with approval at every opportunity to interact with the NorCal legend, especially when the topics touched on illicit behavior.</p>\n<p>Nickatina’s stage presence enhanced the show’s appeal. Standing well over 6-feet tall, he towered over his crowd and made the stage look small. He was clearly the man that people came to see and his demeanor spoke louder than his rapping. His New York Yankees hat, cocked slightly to the left, oozed “old school emcee.” The do-rag that sat under it provided a tangible memory of early 2000s hip-hop.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It didn’t take long for Nickatina to weave his legendary background into the show. His crowd was energized by knowledge of his pivotal role in pioneering Bay Area hip-hop. After just one song, he called for everyone to put one hand in the sky for his deceased friend and fellow Bay Area icon, Mac Dre. Just a few songs later the crowd happily complied when Nickatina requested, “When I say Mac, y’all say Dre.”</p>\n<p>The peak of the show was marked by Nickatina’s performance of his most popular song, “Ayo for Yayo.” Most of the concertgoers rapped the words, creating a full-blown party atmosphere. Nickatina recognized the vibe of his crowd and occasionally held out his microphone for some rapping assistance.</p>\n<p>By the time Nickatina’s set was ending, the cloud of smoke hovering above the crowd made the venue’s laser beam light fixtures readily visible. The rapper’s go-to audience interactions all revolved around marijuana, so it wasn’t surprising to see (and smell) the culmination of burnt herbs.</p>\n<p>Velvet Jones was a fantastic venue for Nickatina because his performance style fits a small stage perfectly. He created an intimate atmosphere. Fans in the front row were within arms reach and those who wanted to observe from a distance found a nice viewing spot on the balcony. Many attendees over 21-years-old stationed themselves around the bar. Attendees of all ages enjoyed some famous Velvet Jones macaroni and cheese to cap off a satisfying night of entertainment.</p>\n<p>Watching Nickatina felt like a special experience, as his role in pioneering a sound for the Bay Area makes him a walking piece of history. Nickatina’s affiliation with artists like Mac Dre, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and E-40 accentuates his importance amongst some of rap’s great minds.</p>\n<p>The best thing about seeing older performers is that you never know when the opportunity will arise again. Nickatina’s current touring schedule is very sparse. Who knows when he might give up the grind for good?</p>\n<p>If you have the chance to see Nickatina sometime in the future, make sure to buy a ticket. His Santa Barbara show charged a modest $20. This is surely a deal, but can you really put a price on a musical performance that is deeply influenced by 1990s hip-hop tradition? Concerts from artists like Nickatina are hard to come by in today’s music world, where the focus is always on “what’s next.” Take some time to appreciate those who pioneered hip-hop, and keep an eye out for a chance to see the true Bay Area legend, Andre Nickatina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/bay-area-legend-andre-nickatina-comes-to-velvet-jones/","id":6864,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6863,6862,6861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[5922,6696,6724,6772,6856,6864,6914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Vince Staples Delivers Comedy and Hip-Hop at the Hub","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vince-Staples_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vince-Staples_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last Thursday, the abundance of pastel baseball caps and imitation Balmain jeans made the Hub resemble more Tumblr meet-up than a Vince Staples show.

When the doors opened, attendees were met with the daunting, yet serious tone of Tupac’s “Hail Mary.” The playlist that replaced a DJ continued with tracks that were not as energetic as one would anticipate for a concert. Such tunes included ASAP Ferg’s hardcore “Fuck Out My Face” and Travis Scott’s “Mamacita.” By the time Future’s captivating “Commas” single came into rotation, concertgoers were content with swaying to the beat and keeping their eyes glued to the screens of their gadgets, for there was no DJ to encourage them to go crazy.</p>\n<p>Ready to spin the night in a better direction, opener, Chayetione, came with rhymes, a flow and jokes to please the crowd. The Santa Barbara native entertained as he admitted, “I don’t have a DJ right now, ‘cause I’m low budget.” He concluded, “but, I do have an iPod shuffle.” As his reliance on the iPod suggested, his set was not in any particularly preplanned order. Instead, he rapped on the fly as the beat to each track echoed throughout the venue, unbeknownst to him since the screen to his iPod was cracked. In fact, his ability to adapt to each song within seconds made his set engaging and intriguing. Concertgoers chuckled as Chayetione vocalized his approval and excitement of each of the surprise songs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lyricist bounced around the stage as he spewed out lyrics with his old-school flow. Chayetione sought to uplift and inspire with tracks like “Life,” “Hate Down Peace Up” and “Dream,” which he wrote when living out of his car in Los Angeles two years ago. His beats and flow echoed rappers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, proving that Mos Def, Common, and Talib Kweli are indeed amongst his greatest rap inspirations.</p>\n<p>The buzz Chayetione manage to invoke amongst the crowd fizzled as soon as it developed. As he ended his set with a Mr. Carmack sample, students had to endure another wave of mundane songs, occasionally alternated with tracks by Future and Schoolboy Q, from the infamous inconsistent playlist as they awaited the man of the night.</p>\n<p>Unaware and unconcerned with the rollercoaster of emotions the audience had endured, Vince Staples burst on the stage at 10:03 to “Lift Me Up,” fully equipped with the energy necessary to lift fans up out of their funk. After stomping all over the stage in his high top Converse, the rapper paused to advocate for homework over concerts and relay hi amazement at the fact that there is a Panda Express on campus. The Long Beach representative cut back into his set with “65 Hunnid,” before opting to perform the latter part of the track without its accompanying instrumental.</p>\n<p>A far cry from their behavior earlier in the evening, audience members grew rowdy throughout Staples’ set. As the 22 year old continued with tracks “Dopeman” and “Hang ‘N’ Bang” from his debut album <em>Summertime ’06</em>, the crowd grew just as wild as the performer with their nonstop pushing and shoving. Although the Norf Norf emcee produced such excitement from the onlookers, they grew irritated with his various monologues – ranging from his frustration towards his photographer/videographer to a rant on pregnancy. In fact, students begin to evacuate the Hub and save their self from the endless jokes and rants.</p>\n<p>Although the show fell somewhere in between a failed Chris Tucker standup comedy skit and a rap concert, those who stuck out the rambling won performances of fan-favorites. The instant Vince rapped the first bar to “Norf Norf,” second-year, Derrick Duren exclaimed, “Finally!” before slithering his way to the front row. The crowd chanted the lyrics “I ain’t never ran from nothing but the police,” although the bulk of the crowd has probably never had to dodge such police encounters.</p>\n<p>Staples concluded the show with first-year Vanessa Ayala’s favorite song, “Blue Suede.” In spite of the new invasive privacy policy, the Snapchat app was plastered on every cell phone in hopes of capturing the “Blue Suede” performance. Ayala shared her appreciation for A.S. Board Program noting, “it’s really dope, cause it’s at my school, I was super hyped.”</p>\n<p>In spite of the mediocre DJ-replacement playlist and excessive talking from Staples, concertgoers left the Hub in decent spirits. To hear more from the chatty rapper, <em>Summertime ’06</em> is available on iTunes and Chayetione’s nostalgic tracks can be found on his self-titled soundcloud.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mb6Jc4juSF8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/vince-staples-delivers-comedy-and-hip-hop-at-the-hub/","id":6861,"author":{"id":719,"name":"Nisa Smith"},"related":[6860,6859,6858],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cherub Comes to Earl Warren Showgrounds","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Hippie-Sabotage_McLane-Brown-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Hippie-Sabotage_McLane-Brown-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Amidst the smell of marijuana and hipster sweat, the chants for Cherub ensued.

The Nashville duo celebrated their first headlining show in Santa Barbara, selling out at Earl Warren Showgrounds on Nov. 20. After opener Hippie Sabotage delivered an epic set list with a rave-worthy light show, fans were well-prepared for Cherub’s eclectic reinterpretation of their live performance.</p>\n<p>Jason Huber and Jordan Kelley met in college at Middle Tennessee State University, and started making music together in 2010. <em>Man of the Hour </em>was the starting point of their viral career. The two built a loyal fan base with their festival-ready sound, appearing at Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. Their synth pop, neo-disco fusion was packed into another full-length album just five months after their debut, titled <em>MoM &amp; DaD</em>. The heavy use of layering of Kelley’s half spoken falsettos created the group’s most effective harmonies yet.</p>\n<p>Huber and Kelley scored their “So … You DTF?” tour in the wake of their most successful single to date “Doses and Mimosas.” Hitting 28 states, the duo is joined on stage by their producer Nick Curtis and long-time friend Jordan Bartlett for their biggest tour so far. Revealing an incredible show that was years in the making, fans heard new songs, old favorites and saw Cherub as they’ve never been seen before.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>They kicked off the night asking everybody to clap to the beat as they launched into “XOXO.” The bouncing synths combined with Kelley’s charged vocals had the whole venue screaming obscenities. Huber finished the upbeat break-up ballad with an incredible guitar riff as skimpy shirts and plastic Hawaiian leis flew on stage. The group laughed to each other as they eyed the reckless crowd. “This is our first time headlining here,” said Kelley. “So we just want to thank y’all for selling this bitch out.”</p>\n<p>They jumped into their most recent album from 2014, <em>Year of the Caprese, </em>with the track “Work the Middle.” Huber’s intricate melodies on the guitar played with the funky notes on the synths, creating an alternative-disco hybrid. The crowd moved in sync with the lyrics as they danced without a care.</p>\n<p>The festival-style atmosphere heightened as the fan favorite “Disco Shit” began playing. Girls and guys went up on shoulders, and the largest dance circle the Showgrounds has ever seen ensued. With the mesmerizing electric blue lights, the concert transformed into a full-blown party.</p>\n<p>Cherub slowed things down a bit with “Chocolate Strawberries” off of <em>Year of the Caprese. </em>They showed us their underrepresented “romantic” side, singing, “You like fast cars and I like fast broads, yeah.” The comical cocaine and sex references somehow come off soft and sweet layered over throwback 80s beats.</p>\n<p>Their sexier side showed during “Freaky Me, Freaky You.” An interesting spin on your average love song, Kelley’s lyrics meander from endearing to comically irreverent and back again. The effects of the often-overlooked talk box take the track to a mystic level.</p>\n<p>As the group quickly ran off stage, fans knew the show couldn’t be over yet. Screams of excitement and chants for an encore got Huber and Kelley running in front of the stage. Jason Huber prepared with the other musicians on stage, while Jordan Kelley sincerely connected with the crowd. He slowly made his way around the fenced-off semicircle, stopping for pictures and reaching for hands in the audience. As he approached the middle, the excitement could not be contained any longer. A sudden uproar from the middle caught his attention. “You know, I sweated all the liquor I drank last night so I’d like to drink some more tonight,” Kelley said. “Can I have some?”</p>\n<p>They finally gave fans what they had been longing for as they closed the show with “Doses and Mimosas,” Cherub’s most successful single. The track blends everything we love about Cherub: A mingled array of electronic sounds and dance-all-night party mentality. The lyrics are the epitome of everything Cherub stands for: “It’s all overrated except drugs and alcohol.” Feeling uplifted and invincible, fans funneled out with a newfound appreciation for the talent behind the saucy duo that comprises Cherub.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJsI0zTA5qc&amp;spfreload=10</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/cherub-comes-to-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/cherub-comes-to-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/cherub-comes-to-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/cherub-comes-to-earl-warren-showgrounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/cherub-comes-to-earl-warren-showgrounds/","id":6862,"author":{"id":731,"name":"Jordan Metz"},"related":[6861,6860,6859],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Azeem X Underbelly Return to Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Walking into the dimly lit room at SOhO in downtown Santa Barbara Thursday night was a bit like walking into a reunion with old friends.

Groups of people were scattered across the room or sitting at tables anticipating Azeem Ward’s first public performance with Timmy Linetsky — otherwise known as Underbelly, who is a current student at UC Santa Barbara and Ward’s co-headliner for the night — in Santa Barbara since he graduated last spring. “We met one night at an open mic right after he blew up. We jammed once or twice and then spent the whole summer planning tour dates in Europe,” said Underbelly. The duo travelled all over Europe this summer, bringing their unique fusion of beatbox flute and jazzy hip-hop electronic bass music to people who had watched Ward’s senior flute recital last year when he became an overnight internet sensation in the United Kingdom. This concert was Ward’s discreet homecoming, and many of his close friends were in attendance. “I was really worried no one would come because we could have promoted it better, but a lot of people ended up being here,” said Underbelly. The night began with a DJ set, which the crowd met with mild enthusiasm, up until the last song where a break-dancer took over the floor with dangerous-looking dance moves.</p>\n<p>As soon as Azeem Ward and Underbelly set up on stage, the pit flooded with the bodies of excited college students. Not long after, a surprise special guest — rapper DGA, who has been close friends with Underbelly since high school — took the stage. Their first song was a funky collaboration between the two of them, where Ward showed off his signature beatbox flute. The crowd’s response to hearing Ward’s unconventional music was overwhelmingly positive. “The crowd had a lot of hype considering the size. People really respond to Ward, they are genuinely into it, not in a condescending way,” said DGA. “People know this is kind of funny because its flute, but they also know it’s really good.” The trio soon started playing groovier and groovier songs, such as a flute remix of “Sexy Back” by Justin Timberlake.</p>\n<p>The night then took a more sensual turn when Underbelly announced that he and Ward were about to play some slower, sexier tunes. If the audience was not aware before, they instantly became believers in the fact that the flute could create some sexy beats as Ward continued to deliver smooth note after smooth note. Frequent beat changes and seamless runs defined Ward’s covers and original music, keeping the crowd mesmerized.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the tempo changed from slick and slow to sleep-inducing, Ward and Underbelly reintroduced DGA onstage. The arrival of DGA prompted Ward to announce to the relaxed crowd that he was about to play some of his harder songs. The audience quickly learned what his “hard songs” were high intensity party songs that rekindled the previously calmer energy in the venue. However, it wasn’t until Ward and Underbelly played the first note of their famous cover of Darude’s “Sandstorm” did the crowd completely lose any inhibitions they may have had, grooving and dancing along to the beats. Ward’s flute melodies coaxed the more whimsical personality traits of a few of the concert goers to surface — some boys mimed having a tea party on the venue floor as everyone proceeded to wildly dance and mosh around them.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, the crowd remained completely supportive of their fellow Gauchos Ward and Underbelly. The night progressed as if Ward was playing at a friend’s house show rather than a venue in downtown Santa Barbara. “I expected to see a lot of friends from back home, but I didn’t expect many other people to come since we had to promote this ourselves,” said Ward. “This show was a lot of fun, when you have a connection with people it’s easier to play.” The crowd even broke into the famous UC Santa Barbara “Olè Gaucho” chant, to which Ward adorably shuffled to onstage right before taking a group picture with anyone who could fit into the camera frame.</p>\n<p>Although this small, intimate concert didn’t garner as much attention or press as Ward’s grand senior flute recital, Ward preferred the cozier setting. “My recital was a lot of pressure, this one was a lot more fun,” Ward said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66819\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66819\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-26/azeem-x-underbelly-return-to-santa-barbara/","id":6863,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6862,6861,6860],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
