I had thought I could use my voice to incite change regarding this issue. Now, only two days later, 17 more kids exactly like me, high school students filled with optimism for the future, had lost their lives to a senseless act of gun violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The epidemic of gun violence is no secret to the community of Isla Vista, as four years prior, the Isla Vista tragedy left an enormous mark on our college town. The United States has had </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">57 times as many school shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as other industrial nations combined and in 2017, had the 28th highest rate of death from gun violence </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/11/09/666209430/deaths-from-gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-with-the-rest-of-the-world\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. American students of all ages live in rational fear of gun violence, and yet very little has changed to protect them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2020 was the </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-first-march-without-school-shooting-since-2002-united-states/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first March in nearly two decades without a school shooting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the United States, not because of groundbreaking gun control legislation, but assumedly because of campus closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Simply shutting down schools seems to be the only way to prevent further shootings, as government regulation of firearms has been historically inefficient in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the rate of mass public shootings have fallen, the pandemic has brought on its own host of gun-related problems. Recent state-wide lockdowns have required the closure of all nonessential businesses. Those businesses that are allowed to stay open provide essential items such as groceries, gasoline and medical care. Recently, businesses that sell firearms have manipulated their way onto that list. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many states originally ordered firearms businesses to close but immediately reversed their initial orders after being slapped with </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/buckling-pressure-many-states-deem-gun-stores-essential-allow-them-n1177706\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple lawsuits by gun rights advocates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The threat of widespread litigation combined with </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-stores-ruled-essential-businesses-during-coronavirus-shutdowns-11585601189\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense lobbying by gun-industry groups</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> led the federal government to officially advise states to categorize gun stores, gun manufacturers, and shooting ranges as critical businesses allowed to remain open during the stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, allowing firearm businesses to remain open has only exacerbated an environment of fear-mongering and violence during an already stressful time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of pandemic panic, firearm and ammunition sales have skyrocketed. Over the past few weeks, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjjohnsonjr/status/1238868541689880576\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long lines of customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could even be seen stretching out of the doors of some Los Angeles gun stores. Store owners are attributing this </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-gun-buyers.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 to 40% spike in sales</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entirely to the virus scare and are now typically selling as many as 300 firearms a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But guns will not make Americans any safer in the face of COVID-19. In fact, these panic-fueled purchases are just inciting more violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overall crime has declined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the pandemic, </span><a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2020/05/21/pandemic-quieted-public-shootings-but-not-gun-violence-arizona-westgate/5238089002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gun violence has not</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Gun violence has disproportionately impacted communities of color due to historic racism surrounding housing, education and employment. These are now some of the communities </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-us-surgeon-general-jerome-adams-covid-19-disproportionate-impact-black-america/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hit hardest by the coronavirus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, creating an feasible environment for responsive gun violence to occur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Chicago, the police department has reported </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a double-digit increase in gun incidents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to this time last year. Similarly, Philadelphia is seeing a </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-gun-violence-double-public-health-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% increase in homicide shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to last year. Many city leaders fear that, with increased possession of firearms and ammunition, the number of shootings may only increase further once lockdowns are lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidental shootings due to new possession of firearms are also on the rise. In Albuquerque, a man was arrested for </span><a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/1434623/man-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-13-yr-old-cousin.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accidentally shooting and killing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his 13-year-old cousin. He told detectives that he was arming himself for protection amidst the coronavirus scare and hadn’t realized that his shotgun was loaded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, this influx in gun sales may be contributing to a decline in home safety. In Houston, </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-domestic-violence-victims-stay-at-home-orders-do-not-offer-safety/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">domestic violence calls have increased by 6%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the month of March and were up by 21% percent in Phoenix. This trend is reverberating throughout the nation, as </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/5/21248369/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-violence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay-at-home orders are proving to be a danger for domestic violence victims, which is only exacerbated by the presence of a gun in the home. In Pennsylvania, a man reportedly </span><a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-latest-roderick-bliss-shoots-longtime-girlfriend-kills-self-after-being-extremely-upset-about-pandemic-losing-job-wilson-police-say/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shot his girlfriend and then himself</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after losing his job due to the pandemic. Incidents like these, in which family members are the target of gun violence, are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, firearms have become a symbol of apocalyptic panic in this pandemic. Gun-toting protesters have flocked to state legislatures, in clear defiance of stay-at-home orders. It didn’t take long for </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michigan-capitol-protests-lockdown-stay-at-home-vote-armed-bulletproof-vest-a9493306.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pictures of these angry demonstrators</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> armed with assault rifles and screaming at politicians in bulletproof vests to circulate through social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing firearm businesses to remain open during this already high-strung period has ultimately produced more panic and fueled more violence than what previously existed. The fact that Americans believe that buying guns is a logical form of protection from this pandemic clearly indicates the growth of this mass hysteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increase in violence, if anything, should highlight the importance of gun control legislation. Now, exactly six years since the Isla Vista tragedy sparked activism in our own Santa Barbara community, gun violence remains as prevalent an issue as ever. For those of you who, like me, have been fighting for safer schools and communities since school shootings became a terrifying reality, I hope the implications of this pandemic will reignite your fight. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Kocis rejects the labeling of firearms businesses as essential and pushes for greater gun control legislation.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

I don’t have a passion like that, and it’s okay not to.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92752\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92752\" data-attachment-id=\"92752\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/why-having-a-passion-is-overrated/passion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/passion-e1581573119806.jpg?fit=650%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,454\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"passion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/passion-e1581573119806.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/passion-e1581573119806.jpg?fit=888%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92752\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/passion-e1581573119806.jpg?resize=650%2C454\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"454\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92752\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Channing Mink / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve wasted so much of my life desperate for a passion to call my own. Ever since I was old enough to know what medicine was, I claimed becoming a doctor as my passion — it felt natural to me. So natural, in fact, that I selectively ignored just how boring I actually found the subject and how much trouble I had understanding it. I held onto this supposed passion of mine while entering college, where I decided I would pursue the pre-med path. Several chemistry classes and many mental breakdowns later, I realized there was nothing I dreaded more than spending the next decade of my life studying the natural sciences. I personally could not bring myself to care about studying them in the slightest. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I switched my major to psychology and communication, subjects that, don’t get me wrong, I find interesting and enjoy learning about, but I still wouldn’t call either of them my passion. I’ve struggled with the idea that something must be inherently wrong with me if I can’t find just one thing I could be passionate enough to devote my life to. Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay. It’s kind of a hard idea to come to terms with, but I’m becoming more comfortable with it. It always seemed like everyone around me had found their calling, but I’ve discovered that I’m actually far from alone in this struggle.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is allegedly the time when we should discover this one elusive passion, and I think this idea adds another unnecessary imperative to the list of things we, as students, need to be concerned about. Pressure is high during these years. The world, and us, wonder what we’re going to do with our lives. I find the idea that you need to, or should, spend your life following your “passion” unrealistic and limiting. It undermines everything that you pursue that isn’t done in the name of a passion, and the value of living without one. Your life can be complete and fulfilling without having that one particular thing that you’re living for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not often that a person is lucky enough to have always known exactly what they wanted to do with their life and that this interest is really as exciting and fulfilling as they expected. What I was passionate about when I was younger isn’t what I’m passionate about now, and what I’m passionate about now most likely won’t be what I’m passionate about many years in the future. There are things I’m passionate about, sure, but I can’t limit myself by saying that I have just one passion. I like to believe that having a passion is not a goal, or a life plan, or a major in college. It’s a feeling that can change given your circumstances and interests — a feeling that you can’t plan your life around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you can have a purposeful life without passion, by doing things that bring meaning to your life. You really don’t have to have, or eventually find, your one true passion and spend your life pursuing it. I think it’s completely okay not to have one at all. You might discover a passion eventually, or you might not, and frankly, it doesn’t matter either way. As long as you devote your time to endeavors that you believe are valuable, help others or bring happiness to your life, that’s just fine too. A life not dedicated to a strong interest is still a life worth living and one full of important contributions to society. Uncertainty is scary, and uncertainty about something as important as your direction in life is even scarier, but I think it’s okay not to know where you’re going. What matters is that you live in a way that’s important to you. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo is very passionate about not having a passion.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Veronica Vo</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Veronica Vo is an opinion staff writer and a second year psychology major.

Rather, I choose to think of 2019 as a year of accomplishing a lot academically, building my resume and gaining a newfound sense of confidence. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think back on it, I have changed a lot over the course of 2019. While I went into college with a certain sense of independence, I was still very naive. I pursued opportunities that made me happy instead of ones that I thought</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would look good on a resume, but I tended to question whether I was doing enough to prove my self-worth. The confident attitude I gained towards the beginning of 2019 was not crafted by a “New Year’s resolution” but an attitude I naturally developed in order to get what I wanted out of life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I, like the rest of the population, have personality traits I could “work” on in the new year, I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves. The new year should instead be looked at as an opportunity for self evaluation. Are the people in our lives and the academic endeavors we’re pursuing making us happy and excited for the future? If the answer is no, I think it is on us to make a change in the new year. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I ended this quarter feeling a little drained, like I was stuck in an endless routine. So for 2020, I plan to try new things that are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> geared towards success but towards general enjoyment. We should value our time in 2020 and maximize it towards its fullest potential. We should spend time making our own lives feel balanced, prioritizing our needs as well as the needs of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new year can also be looked at as an opportunity to be civically engaged by taking on work that affects the community in a positive way. Giving back strays from the typical New Year’s resolution that is geared directly towards personal growth, but it can still be an influencing factor in our futures. Getting involved in my student newspaper, helping educate elementary students about tree species and registering students to vote are all things I have been involved in this past year and have allowed me to contribute to my community as well as my sense of individuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the new year often involves meeting new people, having new experiences and forming new social circles. While this seems exciting, one thing I have learned in 2019 is to not leave your old friends behind. We can often get swept up in new romances, friends and groups that make us forget we need to make an active effort to reconnect with people who have been there when we’ve needed them in the past. I’ve reconnected with people I hadn’t talked to in a long time over winter break and am subsequently happier because of it. So reach out to your childhood best friend, old neighbor or extended family. Ultimately, it could affect both your life and theirs for the better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to popular belief, the new year does not necessarily need to be a period of change for everyone. Instead of thinking of the new year as a chance to kick a habit you’ll probably end up keeping, reexamine your daily routine and carve out more time for your own personal enjoyment and stability.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai thinks the new year is a good time for celebration, reflection and natural change rather than arbitrary resolutions. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

For many, this includes exploring their sex lives. It seems as though having many wild sexual encounters is an expectation of the normal male college experience, and men rarely get shamed for their Friday-night decisions. And yet, I see women being shamed all the time for having similar experiences. Words like “hoe,” “thot” and “bitch” are used every day around Isla Vista. The idea of a girl “giving it up easily” and thus being “easy” is seen as an absolute atrocity, yet the more girls a man can bed, the better.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, I don’t believe that the idea of having sex with random strangers multiple times a day on a regular basis should be a celebrated norm for anybody. This is for many reasons, but namely because sex is often such a personal and emotional experience and because of legitimate health risks associated with this activity (namely STIs). However, I also believe that neither my, nor anyone else’s, personal feelings about sex should affect anyone else’s choices. I think that a lot of girls make decisions about sex that they wouldn’t make otherwise because they feel judged or shamed by society. For instance, I know a lot of girls who are concerned about keeping their “number” down in order to avoid having a high “body count,” meaning that they deny themselves the full range of sexual experiences they desire to have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sick of the idea that a girl isn’t the “bring-home-to-mom type” because she makes even a third of the choices that a man might make regarding sex.

Of course, I hope that all women respect themselves and make choices that they are comfortable and content with. Everyone should hold themselves accountable for taking care of themselves and making healthy choices. And yet, we shouldn’t make it our business to tear down those who we see doing things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is entitled to and has a right to their personal preferences and beliefs, but must we always make other people’s business our business? We are all on our own paths, learning from our own decisions. Your body is your choice. All that should matter to other people about your decisions is that they are safe ones.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hazel Siff wishes people would keep their noses out of other people’s sex lives.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-14/college-coitus-the-double-standard-has-got-to-go/","id":6467,"author":{"id":784,"name":"Hazel Siff"},"related":[6466,6465,6464],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
