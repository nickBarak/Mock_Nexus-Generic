Although overlooked, the journey of a four-year starter is still alive. It’s usually the case at mid-major Division I schools. It’s a reality we oftentimes witness at UCSB on a yearly basis. While it is common at UCSB, the opportunity to watch a player’s development over the span of four years is a priceless experience. In the case of guard Gabe Vincent, who is preparing for the next chapter in his playing career, the four-year process was nothing short of fulfilling as his name is forever etched in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Your collegiate career has officially come to an end. Have you had the chance to reflect on your time as a Gaucho?</strong><br>\nGV: “I did a little bit [of reflecting] after the loss in the Big West Tournament. I took a week off, but that was more so for my body, so it could recuperate and get prepared for my next step. It’s been a fun ride. I completed some things I didn’t think I would or really had in my sights. Obviously, I had some unfinished business. But all in all, it’s been amazing. Everything I could have ever wanted it to be in many ways.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of “unfinished business,” the main focus was to make the NCAA tournament. It was a feat that didn’t happen for you during your career. After going through that, how much of an impact did it have on you? At the same time, how did it influence your mentality to grind for it year in and year out?</strong><br>\nGV: “It’s a motivation. It’s a goal for every collegiate basketball player. At least it should be if it isn’t. That’s the ultimate goal every season, day in and day out. Falling short of that year after year makes you work harder in the offseason. It’s the ultimate motivation; not achieving something you wanted and planned to achieve. That journey was rough. Battling back from injury, looking back, it has all helped mold me into who I am today. Not achieving this goal is still going to motivate me everyday moving forward in my professional career as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SW: Just a few weeks ago, you, Leland King II and two other seniors of the Big West (CP’s Victor Joseph and UCR’s Chance Murray) played in college basketball’s first ever three-on-three tournament/national championship (Dos Equis 3×3). Y’all didn’t win the championship, but can you talk about that experience? Was it difficult adjusting to playing with two guys you usually were matched up against? How was it to be able to do something that college athletes aren’t allowed to do as far as making some money?</strong><br>\nGV: “That experience was very different. Very different. Even though we were representing the Big West and Santa Barbara in a way, it didn’t feel like it because we were getting paid. It more so felt like ‘this is the first step toward a professional career.’ It was fun being able to play for money with those other guys that you are used to being enemies with. You study their game and film, and know everything they can do left and right. It was definitely nice to play with them and not against them, and get to know them in a different way. Even the game of three-on-three with the rules they had was something that five-on-five doesn’t even expose you to at all. Being able to battle and get to the championship was a great opportunity that went really well for us. Unfortunately, we fell short but we were able to make some money and played well.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Although your collegiate playing career has concluded, you are already back training and preparing for the next level. How has that process been? What kind of regimen are you on at the moment? Is there anything new or are you sticking to your usual preparation leading up to that moment?</strong><br>\nGV: “The preparation is a little bit different in terms of not having games to prepare for right now. It’s more so preparing for workouts and being ready at any time to showcase my talents and to stay in shape. Before, I couldn’t work out as much, especially with my knee. I was worried about my knee and overworking it. But now, with it being close to 100 percent, I’m able to do more. Not having to worry about a game and what not, they can push my limits and see how in-shape I can get and try to get better each day, I’m able to work out more. As of right now, I’m lifting really early, like a 6:30 a.m. lift followed by a hoop workout. I get some food, get another workout in during the day, whether it be an hour or two hours later, just trying to work it in around class [too]. I’m just trying to do as much as possible honestly. Anytime I can hoop, I’m definitely taking advantage of it. Anything I can do to get better.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of the next level, is there anything you have lined up in regard to making the transition to the pro ball?</strong><br>\nGV: I’m kind of in this limbo of being ready whenever my number may be called and waiting to see what happens in the next few months here. I’ve hired an agent. I’m in the finalizing stages of that. Getting that moving forward and having someone to speak on my behalf soon will be great. I’m just trying to get ready for hopefully any league workouts I can get, and just to be prepared for what comes next in the summer. Right now, I’m just preparing for that next step and trying to set things up. It’s really interesting for me, as someone who is not anticipating to be drafted. Everything is kind of slow for a while, then things start happening really quickly and you get those answers you’re searching for.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: It’s a known fact that UCSB isn’t a sports powerhouse. Given that fact, your journey to playing professionally may possibly be more challenging than expected. Is that potential challenge something you anticipate and will embrace? Does it kind of put a chip on your shoulder?</strong><br>\nGV: “A little bit. Coming to this school, I knew that would be something I would have to deal with down the road. I didn’t exactly have the career in many ways that I wanted to. I think coming back this year with my injury kind of held me back numbers wise from the numbers kind of year that I could’ve had. That definitely hurts me moving forward to this spring and summer. But with that being said, at the end of the day, it’s all about who can play and who can perform. I knew that coming into Santa Barbara, and it’s part of the reason I came here because I wanted to go somewhere where I could get better. I think I’ve done that. I’m just trying to get better, and continue to work on my craft and perfect it.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Have you reached out to any past Gauchos that are currently playing professional ball? Have you sought any type of advice?</strong><br>\nGV: “Absolutely. I’ve been close to some guys since I committed to UCSB. I’ve been close with Michael Bryson, who is in the NBA G League right now, James Nunnally, he’s overseas now, Orlando Johnson as well. Those are the three people I’ve been in contact with, and they’ve always been good during my whole four years here. They’ve reached out and checked in on me, and have given advice here and there. They’ve been good resources for me, and a good a part of this Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: If you could talk to the younger Gabe, is there one particular thing you’d like to mention? Any advice or lesson learned that you have now that would be significant enough?</strong><br>\nGV: “That’s a tough question for me. I’ve always been a little more mature than my peers around me and a little more professional with how I carry myself. I think I would give advice to trust the process. That everything you do affects the way things are going to be. Everything I do now, every decision I make now, in my mind, I’m making as a pro. If it’s not going to make me better as a pro, then it’s like, ‘why would I go do that?’ Whether it helps my mentality, my body [is important]. I would try to push that mindset on myself at a younger age, which I think I had a little bit of, but obviously as you get older it becomes more serious and you’re closer to being at that level. These are all of the sorts of things I would tell myself in hopes that I would listen as a young kid and take that advice.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: In one word, who is Gabe Vincent?</strong><br>\nGV: “Wow. That’s a tough question. I’m going to need a second here.”<br>\n“I would say leader.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 12th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When fans think of professional athletes, most tend to lean towards believing that these are people with great mental health. The reason is because these are people that reach the highest level of their individual field and something like that cannot be done without a strong sense of confidence, both internally and externally.</p>\n<p>However, as athletes are now reminding us today, that is not at all the case. As Kevin Love said, everyone is going through something.<br>\nAnd that is especially true at the collegiate level. College players are expected to juggle so much, whether it be their play on the court or their academics off of it. Like many, these transitions are tough, but they can be combated with experience and a continual growth mentally.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Max Heidegger has had an interesting start to his college career. This past season, Heidegger became the face of the UCSB men’s basketball team becoming a breakout star who averaged a team-high 19.1 points per game on a very efficient 43 percent shooting and 40 percent from beyond the arc.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Malibu, California native was one of the key reasons for the Gauchos’ historic turnaround, winning 23 games this year compared to winning six the previous season. The 23 wins also tied the program’s best mark for wins in a single season.</p>\n<p>However, even he could attest that in a time of winning that the balance of everything never comes easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard in general, everyday. It’s really tough balancing your time because obviously you want to relax a lot and hang out, but it’s tough with school, obviously, and having your basketball obligations you have to do and then also you have to work on your game on your own,” Heidegger said. “Balancing everything and getting your time organized is really tough. For me personally, having other things to do that aren’t basketball or school, other obligations, it gets really tough because I’m not free to do anything until six or seven, especially in season.”</p>\n<p>And yet, it hasn’t been an easy ride for the sophomore. In his freshman campaign, Heidegger averaged just 7.6 points per game and shot 26.8 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Along with that, the former high school All-CIF player was battling injuries, something that has bothered him throughout his career.<br>\n“It was really tough on me personally. Right before the year I got hurt again, in high school I had a ton of injury problems so that was a little disheartening for me, but it was kind of after the season it came to a point where I could feel sorry for myself but I knew I had things I had to do to improve myself and so I went out there and did it. But it was for sure difficult during the season and after,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>A lot of times, we as fans take these things for granted. Heidegger has clearly transformed his game and it’s easy to chalk it up to new coaching or schemes but, in reality, it was a lot of hard work both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>New Head Coach Joe Pasternack and his staff certainly played a huge role in the turnaround of the UCSB men’s basketball program, but at the end of the day players are the ones who make the real difference come game time.</p>\n<p>In his first game this season, Heidegger was amazing. The sophomore led the Gauchos to a roaring 85-66 win over a talented North Dakota State squad in which he scored 33 points. Heidegger was definitely ready come game one, but not without a lot of hard work before that.</p>\n<p>“Going into this past season I was a little anxious especially early on. Right before our first scrimmage I was anxious, because I hadn’t played in a long time and I didn’t play particularly how I wanted to so I was putting a lot of pressure on myself,” Heidegger said. “I was definitely anxious before this year but obviously it all worked out. I mean, it certainly wasn’t easy, after last year. It was tough, it was tough on all of us. We all as a team, over summer, pulled ourselves up and pulled ourselves together.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger carried the momentum of that first game and parlayed it into a great season, one that was filled with many awards, smiles and most importantly, wins. This season was not perfect for the guard as he still struggled at times but, overall it was a much different experience.</p>\n<p>“Obviously things are easy when things are good, shots are going in and you’re winning games it’s easy to be positive and it’s easy to have confidence,” Heidegger said. “I had some games this year when I struggled but even still, playing well and having a great year, it’s tough as a competitor to swallow that, to play bad and go back to the drawing board. I felt that from last year my freshman year helped me out a lot in terms of maturing and dealing with not everything going my way in college. It helped a lot with dealing with adversity.”<br>\nAnd even in a season where the Gauchos were winning games and having players like Max contribute at a high level there are always bumps that could get in the way.</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB dealt with two major incidents off the court and completely out of their control. The first being the Thomas Fire, a natural disaster that affected an entire community.</p>\n<p>“It was super tough on all of us, mentally. One day we come back to Santa Barbara and then we evacuate. We don’t know if we’re going to play, when we’re going to play. It’s hard to focus on games when you have those outside factors. Especially because we’re having to practice at high schools in Santa Barbara because our gym is smoked out. We walk in there and you can smell the fire and ash in the gym. Stuff like that was hard on us, staying in hotels in LA waiting for games,” Heidegger said.</p>\n<p>I knew it was tough on all of us, but that’s when the team part came into play. We tried not to focus on it too much and just take it in strides, but looking back it was hard going place to place and not knowing what was happening. We thought we were in the clear and then with the mudslides we couldn’t drive anywhere, it was a whole one thing after another. I knew for us it was obviously difficult but I knew it was difficult in the community as well but I know for our guys it was tough. We had a good enough support system between us and obviously our coaches to push through that,” Heidegger added.</p>\n<p>The second thing the Gauchos had to deal with was the Hawai’i bomb scare on the morning of January 13th. Thinking they were just going to play a game that night and nothing else, many of the UCSB athletes were still sleeping when people of Hawai’i were sent an emergency alert that a missile was headed for the country.</p>\n<p>“That was a very weird and interesting experience. We tried not to think about it too much. Once it was over, for me personally, I brushed it off. I know a couple other players and all of us were a little bit shook still but we tried our best to shake it off, but it was super weird,” Heidegger said. “The whole day seemed weird but we really wanted to get out of there. It was a very odd experience. We’re sitting there in the morning thinking if this thing hits then that’s a wrap for us.”</p>\n<p>Athletes do amazing things on their respective field of play, but they are not superhuman. And when sudden tragedies strike they too are affected.</p>\n<p>Heidegger is just one example of an athlete who has overcome plenty of adversity in just two years and you could chalk that up to a lot of things. The great thing about sports is the feeling of camaraderie and that’s something that can’t be replicated.</p>\n<p>“It feels awesome to have guys that you can trust and talk to. At the end of the day a lot of those guys I’m still going to be talking to. It’s a great feeling to have that camaraderie and friendship,” Heidegger said. “Once I’m done playing that’s probably going to be one of the parts I miss the most, being with my teammates and even just sitting in the locker room talking, hanging out. It’s great to be part of the team.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, athletes are people too. They also need time away from what they love doing, they also need time to be with their friends and they also need to be weary of taking care of themselves mentally.</p>\n<p>It is easy for us to constantly come down on athletes after hard games. There were people who came down hard on Max after he only scored three points in a Gaucho loss to Long Beach State this season. But it’s important to remember that, like us, athletes are people, and their struggles are something we should sympathize with, not belittle.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Now that they’re here, though, the Gauchos might as well keep things going.<br>\nThe first step in that process comes on Thursday night when the team takes on Cal Poly in its first-round matchup at the Honda Center. Should the Gauchos take that game, they’ll be just two wins away from the Big West title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Those other two games, however, aren’t on UCSB’s radar at all.</p>\n<p>They’re focused instead on Cal Poly, as if this was any other week.</p>\n<p>“We’re just focused on one game at a time,” Pasternack said. “We’re treating this like a normal Thursday-Saturday week, and we’re locked into this one game. We’ll worry about the next one if we win [on Thursday].”</p>\n<p>Of course, it isn’t just a normal week, no matter what Pasternack says.</p>\n<p>In a single-elimination tournament, even a game against No. 7-seeded Cal Poly has more on the line than any other game the Gauchos have played this season, but that doesn’t mean the team is completely new to the bright lights.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played on big stages this season,” Pasternack explained. “We’ve played against Pitt, Texas A&amp;M and USC, and we didn’t win but we were competitive. We went to UC Davis and got a big win. Our guys are battle-tested.”</p>\n<p>UCSB really couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than Cal Poly to kick off the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>The two teams met just this past Saturday, when the Gauchos dismantled the Mustangs 86-61 in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had one of their best offensive games in weeks, as those 86 points were the most the team had scored since Feb. 8, along with its 27 assists going down as a season-high.</p>\n<p>“That game [against Cal Poly] gave our guys a great deal of confidence. They’re hungry to get back on the court,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>Max Heidegger, UCSB’s leading scorer this season at 19.4 points per game, had a little bit of a bounce back game offensively against the Mustangs, something the team is hoping carries through into the tournament.</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard had 23 points, knocked down five three-pointers and shot 50 percent from the field for the first time since Jan. 17.</p>\n<p>“For Max, you have to look at his complete body of work,” Pasternack said. “You can’t get caught up in his last game or his last few games. He’s shooting 40 percent from three this season, and he’s got the defense focused on him. He’s a complete player, and he dominated on defense last game.”</p>\n<p>The timely return of Jalen Canty two games ago gave the Gauchos just enough time to work the talented senior big man back into the lineup.</p>\n<p>That’s important for a UCSB offense that flows a lot smoother with both Canty and graduate transfer forward Leland King II attracting attention inside, and for a defense that relies on Canty’s menacing rim presence.</p>\n<p>Canty’s positive influence on the offensive end was obvious last Saturday against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Having two major inside threats forced the Cal Poly defense to pull some of their attention away from the three-point line, something that didn’t happen much while the forward was out.</p>\n<p>That was key in the Gauchos’ 86-point performance, which was more than enough offense given UCSB’s defensive performance.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs shot just 39 percent from the field and had only two players score in the double digits.</p>\n<p>One of those players was senior guard Victor Joseph, who led the Mustangs with 14.4 points per game, and had 16 points on Saturday, good for second on the team.<br>\nJunior point guard Donovan Fields, who averaged 13.3 points per game, typically seconds Joseph but on Saturday it was Josh Martin and his 20 points that shouldered the rest of the offensive load.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s 9-21 overall record and 4-12 record in the Big West don’t do much to hype them up as a potential spoiler of UCSB’s title hopes, but both recent and not-quite-as-recent history suggests they still shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos suffered a last-second loss in their first Big West game of the year at the hands of the Mustangs on Jan. 4, just over two months ago, which gave Saturday’s drubbing some revenge flavoring.</p>\n<p>In 2015, UCSB took on Cal Poly in the exact same 2-7 matchup in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament, and just escaped with a 54-50 victory.</p>\n<p>That tournament matchup was, of course, three years ago, and Saturday’s win turned the Jan. 4 matchup into history, but both games should give any UCSB fan or player looking past the coming contest reason to reconsider.</p>\n<p>The turnaround from a year ago began with the final whistle of Big West play and the early April hiring of Pasternack.</p>\n<p>Much of the success in fact, stems from the team forgetting what exactly they were bouncing back from.</p>\n<p>“Our guys have just locked into the process,” Pasternack said. “They’ve had a chip on their shoulder for the last ten months, but they didn’t worry about last season. They’ve been focused on this one.”</p>\n<p>While Pasternack and his players may claim to be focused on just the upcoming Cal Poly game, there’s no question that the whole tournament looms large.</p>\n<p>Three tournament victories, and the Gauchos can put the ultimate cap on their remarkable turnaround.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/","id":973,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[972,971,970],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Eliminated From Big West Tournament Following Loss to CSUN in Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Matadors made a surge late in the game to topple UCSB 72-63 and eliminate the Gauchos from championship contention ending their 2017-18 season with a 12-17 overall mark.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81827\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1910303683\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81875\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81827\" data-attachment-id=\"81827\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/sarah-bates-looks-to-pass-over-a-defender-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sarah Bates looks to pass over a defender.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The game was played in Fullerton, California at the Titan Gym, and was not lacking excitement. After a slow start for Cal State Northridge, the teams slowly began trading buckets, in what was shaping up to be a thrilling game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a strict game plan, which they implemented early on. Knowing that Defensive Player of the Year, junior center Channon Fluker, is dangerous in the paint, the Gauchos were determined to contain her.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out with forceful defense to start the game, causing the Matadors to fall behind early after missing their first six shots.</p>\n<p>On fire in the first quarter and clicking on all cylinders, Santa Barbara’s offense exploded. Senior forward Drew Edelman had two early baskets in the post, making her presence in the game known early.</p>\n<p>Edelman punching in her two shots, combined with senior guard Makala Roper splashing in two three-pointers in the beginning minutes, made it look as if the team was poised to run away with the victory.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament is not for the faint of heart, though, as the Matadors were down but not out.</p>\n<p>Despite being behind early, the stellar three-point shooting from CSUN brought them back in the game. UCSB’s opponents shot 9-for-22 from beyond the arc (44.1 percent), causing a world of trouble for the unsuspecting Gauchos – especially since UCSB only shot at 31.6 percent from three themselves.</p>\n<p>The ‘Chos held a solid 20-13 advantage mid second quarter, but a great 17-8 rally by the Matadors before the end of the first half gave them a 30-28 lead into the break.</p>\n<p>Making second half adjustments, CSUN knew they had to allow Fluker the opportunity to make an impact if they wanted to end up victorious in the game.</p>\n<p>Feeding her as soon as halftime was over, and the third quarter began, Fluker scored four-straight points for the Matadors, and UCSB knew they had to put in work to offset her influence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly answered her challenge, when redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler responded with four points of her own – and the back and forth action was alive and well.</p>\n<p>This constant trading of baskets continued up until nearly midway through the fourth quarter of regulation.</p>\n<p>All knotted up at 53-53 halfway through quarter four, CSUN edged ahead and managed to get up by four, after a pair of free throws from senior forward Tessa Boagni and a stop causing another scoring opportunity.</p>\n<p>This was a pivotal point in the game, as Santa Barbara seemingly did not have an answer and simply could not stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the four points scored by Boagni, Fluker and Boagni made back-to-back baskets, as Cal State Northridge proceeded to go on a run that lasted over three minutes in the last quarter.</p>\n<p>This 11-0 run was unanswered, and the Gauchos were backed in a corner late, as the score sat at 64-53 with 2:44 remaining on the game clock.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos clawed their way back and cut the deficit to 6, on baskets from redshirt junior Sarah Porter, freshman guard Sarah Bates, and another shot by Toler; but it was not enough as CSUN hit a pair of clutch free throws to solidify the outcome of the game, regulation ending with the score at 72-63.</p>\n<p>In her last game as a Gaucho, Edelman enforced her way to yet another double-double, with an amazing 18-point, 12-rebound show. Porter also had a great game, scoring 15, and Toler ended with double digits as well, notching 13 points of her own.</p>\n<p>Boagni led CSUN with a dominating 16 points, scoring 10 of them in the fourth quarter. Freshman guard Destiny Brooks had an impressive 15 points which all came from beyond the arc, and Fluker had a double-double for her squad, as she notched 10-points and grabbed 13 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shot at 39.1 percent in the game, on 25-for-64 shooting; while their opponents had a field goal percentage of 44.1 percent on 26-for-59 shooting.</p>\n<p>This was the final game for four seniors on the Santa Barbara roster: Edelman, Toler, Roper and small forward Chaya Durr.</p>\n<p>With the loss, one has to wonder where the ‘Chos will go from here. They still have great young talent such as freshman Sarah Bates, but losing Toler, Edelman, Roper and Durr will be tough. Luckily they have all summer to figure it out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/","id":974,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[973,972,971],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
