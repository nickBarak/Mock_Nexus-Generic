","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite having nowhere near the offensive output of last weekend’s series, the UCSB baseball team proved it could win in close games, defeating Waseda University of Japan 2-1 on a pinch hit walk-off by junior Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>After a weekend series in which Santa Barbara outscored its opponent 38-11, the Gaucho offense returned to a level of normalcy against the Japanese powerhouse. Santa Barbara had 10 strikeouts and left seven runners on base, but put a runner in scoring position in the ninth inning for Kuresa to drive in.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s victory will not count on its record as the matchup against Waseda was an exhibition game, but the Gauchos have now won six games straight including yesterday’s win and have taken eight of nine games to start the season, one of the program’s best starts to a campaign.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts used the contest to maximize his pitching staff, sending six different players to the mound. Junior pitcher Andrew Vasquez gave up a run in the first inning allowing a triple to the first hitter, followed by a sacrifice fly to advance the runner. However, that was the only damage done to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Vasquez, sophomore Robby Nesovic and junior Campbell Wear pitched the most innings for the Gauchos, going two innings each. The staff as a whole shutdown Waseda to allow only two hits on the day while striking out five.</p>\n<p>UCSB manufactured a run in the fourth inning on a two-out single by freshman catcher Dempsey Grover to tie the game at one apiece. That was the only blemish done to starting pitcher Yuhei Takanashi on the day as he exited after four innings of work that included five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Despite being held in check, UCSB had its opportunities on offense. After consecutive singles in the sixth inning, sophomore outfielder Dalton Kelly hit into a double play to end the scoring threat for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put together another scoring chance in the following inning when a runner reached third base on a sac bunt with one out. However, Waseda punched out the runner on third on a fielder’s choice and UCSB went down quietly.</p>\n<p>Although managing 11 hits in the game, UCSB hitters did not bring another run home until the ninth inning. With one out in the inning, freshman designated hitter Josh Adams singled to right field, followed by a pinch hit single by senior infielder Joey Epperson to put runners on second and first base.</p>\n<p>After a strikeout, Kuresa delivered the game-winning hit to right center field to win the game for UCSB. It was Kuresa’s team-leading 12th RBI of the season.</p>\n<p>Grover had the best game by a Gaucho from the plate, going 3-4 with an RBI in his third game of the season. Junior outfielder Scott Quinlan was also productive, getting two hits in four at-bats.</p>\n<p>Waseda previously defeated the university of Southern California 3-1 on Monday in the midst of a Southern California international road trip. The team will next face UCLA today.</p>\n<p>This matchup against one of the best university baseball teams in Japan was a unique opportunity for the Gauchos to face some international competition. It is certainly always a special event when teams from different nations can come together to play and celebrate a national pastime.</p>\n<p>UCSB now goes on the road to Arizona University to play powerhouses Mississippi State and Arizona in a three-team tournament this weekend. UCSB will play both teams twice with its first game against the Bulldogs at 2 p.m on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 5, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/","id":4450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4449,4448,4447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Presence Declines as Deltopia Dwindles","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=980%2C451&ssl=1","description":"Police presence during Deltopia will continue to decline this year following dropping attendance levels over the past three years.

Rob Romero said. He said they will be predominantly from southern California UC campuses such as UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Diego and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Romero said UCPD had approximately 100 police officers at Deltopia last year.</p>\n<p>This year will also be the first year that UCPD is not installing fencing along El Colegio Road and around residence halls, as the Nexus previously reported.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, said she could not disclose how many officers the Sheriff’s Office will be sending into I.V. this weekend for “safety and security reasons.” She said, however, that there will be less law enforcement personnel than in years past.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the Sheriff’s Office will keep its crowd-control horses “on standby” this weekend, as it did last year.</p>\n<p>“There will still be a strong law enforcement presence. There hasn’t been a dramatic reduction in staff, but we are responding to what we’re seeing, which is a lower number each year, dramatically lower,” she said. “It would be a bit unreasonable to have an unnecessary number of law enforcement in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Police said Deltopia 2016 had a maximum attendance of 3,500 people, a significant decrease from 10,000 attendees in 2015 and 25,000 attendees in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office recorded 48 citations and 45 arrests during Deltopia last year, down from 140 citations and 102 arrests in 2015. There were 190 citations and 130 arrests during Deltopia 2014, police said.</p>\n<p>The county festival ordinance will be in place this weekend, prohibiting residents from playing amplified music between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. from Friday to Monday.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from UCIV, a group formed by the Associated Students Public Safety Commission, will ring doorbells and warn Isla Vistans against violating the festival ordinance to prevent police encounters.</p>\n<p>UCSB spent approximately $36,000 on advertisements urging partygoers to stay away from I.V. during Deltopia weekend, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Estrada said $1,410 of that amount purchased two print ads in the Nexus and $347 purchased an online ad with Mustang News, the student newspaper at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. UCSB’s Office of Public Affairs projects said it has spent approximately $34,000 for digital ads on Facebook, Pandora and Instagram running in areas from San Diego to Paso Robles.</p>\n<p>The university will be enforcing parking restrictions during the weekend. Campus parking officials will be closing all parking lots except Lots 22, 18 and 16.</p>\n<p>Visitors will not be allowed to park in UCSB lots from 11 a.m. Friday to 7:30 a.m. Monday. Only drivers with valid permits are authorized to park on campus.</p>\n<p>The university will also be enforcing a no-guest policy in residence halls from 12 p.m. Friday to 12 p.m. Monday.</p>\n<p>Students will host several alternative programs in and around I.V. during the weekend, including roller skating at the Recreation Center and a concert featuring popular EDM artist RL Grime at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs, said there are talks of making Deltopia a sanctioned event.

The Titans then exploded for five runs in the ninth to close out the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Matt Vedo was charged with the loss to even his record at 5-5, while freshman pitcher Grahamm Wiest picked up his fifth win of the season to improve Fullerton’s record to 32-15 (14-4 Big West).</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game meanwhile proved to be the bright point in the week for the Gauchos as they easily defeated Fullerton 7-1 behind a strong bullpen and balanced offensive attack. Vedo struck out five in three scoreless innings for UCSB as he picked up his fifth win of the season.</p>\n<p>“It was a really great win,” senior first baseman Joe Wallace said. “The pitching was great, the offense was great, defense was great, and when all three aspects of the game play well like that together, it usually ends up in a win.”</p>\n<p>Wallace finished the game 2-3 with an RBI double and two stolen bases, while senior left fielder Lance Roenicke hit a two-run home run to power a Gaucho offense that scored 17 runs in the series.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t do too good of a job [hitting] down at Irvine, so we made a commitment to come back up here and pick up our pitching staff,” Wallace said. “We worked hard to do that all week, and we were able to put some runs on the board.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s game proved to be entertaining in the later innings, after UCSB bounced back from a nine-run deficit to eventually lose 9-7. Junior third baseman Marc Venning and sophomore shortstop Brandon Trinkwon each were 1-4 in the game with two RBI each to lead the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Kevin Gelinas, Friday’s starting pitcher, was roughed up in the early innings, allowing seven runs and two homers in his 3.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a big morale boost for us because Fullerton is a pretty good program,” Wilson said. “We’re on our way to being on that level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face rival Cal Poly in a three-game series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/","id":4448,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[4447,4446,4445],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Injured After Cliff Fall on Del Playa","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Untitled.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Untitled.png?resize=916%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A UCSB student fell off of a balcony on the 66 block of Del Playa at approximately 4:45 p.m. Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 22-year-old UC Santa Barbara student fell off of a balcony on the 66 block of Del Playa at approximately 4:45 p.m. Saturday, according to Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, the female student fell from a balcony Saturday afternoon.
