One year removed from an improbable College World Series run had many people believing this was a team destined to do the same again in this campaign. And with the return of many key players, it’s easy to see why many truly believed that.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward 41 games into the regular season and reality are grim for Santa Barbara: a 19-22 overall record, a sixth-place standing in the Big West with a 5-7 record, and a very low chance of making it back to the NCAA Regionals for the third consecutive season, and fourth in five years.</p>\n<p>To be frank, unless the Gauchos win the rest of their 15 games, they are not going back, and even then, their chances are really low as the only silver lining would be that they swept a No. 8 Cal State Fullerton squad.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Focusing on the now, even if UCSB wants to attempt that, it needs to start with a sweep of a struggling UC Davis squad at home. UCD boasts a deflating 13-23 overall record and currently sits at seventh place in the conference with 5-10 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Santa Barbara is in a position where it cannot afford to overlook any opponent, especially after dropping two of three against UC Riverside — albeit on the road — a team that was 14-22 overall and 2-10 in conference play ranking them at the bottom of the Big West when they faced the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the season, UCSB was really struggling at the plate, however, it has since righted the ship scoring at least six runs in 11 of its last 14 games and has also recorded double-digit hits in 11 of those 14.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Bush has been on a tear lately. The first baseman is currently on a six-game hitting streak batting 9-22 (.409) during that span including one extra-base hit and accounting for nine RBI’s. Bush is also the teams slugging leader at .538 which is also the fourth-best mark in the conference. He is also the first Gaucho since the 2001 campaign to have back-to-back seasons of 10 or more home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also currently have three athletes who rank in the top 15 best batting averages in the conference in junior utility Colton Burns who ranks 11<sup>th</sup> with a .323 line, redshirt freshman outfielder Tommy Jew who ranks 14<sup>th</sup> with a .314 average, and redshirt junior utility Kenny Corey who rounds out the top 15 with a .313 mark.</p>\n<p>Jew, in particular, has also been great as he is currently on a 17-game hitting streak and ranks third on the team in total hits with 43. His slash line has also been nothing short of great with .314/.368/.474.</p>\n<p>On the mound, the Gauchos will again be without usual Friday starter Noah Davis (6-3, 4.57 ERA) who is out an illness. This means junior Kyle Nelson will most likely take the mound on Friday. The left-hander struggled last Friday giving up five hits and six earned runs in just 2.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Due to the Friday change, other changes were made including giving freshman Chris Lincoln his first start of the year. The right-hander got the call for the Sunday game and delivered with a solid 3.2 innings allowing four hits and two earned runs earning him a no decision.</p>\n<p>Davis comes into the match-up fresh off an impressive win 11-10 victory on Tuesday against a very impressive St. Mary’s team who has even beaten Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Ryan Hooper was a star in that series not only extending his hitting streak to 10 games but driving in a season-high three runs. During his last ten games, Hooper has been spectacular batting .429 (15-for-35) with nine runs scored, three doubles, a home run, and 10 RBI.</p>\n<p>All in all, this is a must-win series for UCSB. Despite most likely missing the postseason, the Gauchos still have the opportunity to develop their young talent for the future. Whatever it takes, Santa Barbara must come out in this series like its hair is on fire.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis in a Big West three-game set beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 5 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

After a scoreless fourth by both teams, a pair of runs was netted again by the home squad, this time off of an AJ Sawyer RBI single, and a RBI ground out from Contreras making the score 6-0 after five full innings.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen kicked off the Gaucho sixth with a single to right field. He would come to score on the next hit making the score 6-1 coming off a double from the bat redshirt freshman Tommy Jew who has quickly become one of the brightest spots of UCSB’s young line-up. Despite the 1 for 5 outing, the center fielder is only one of three Gauchos batting above .300 and the only freshman doing so.</p>\n<p>Despite the RBI double with no outs, the Gauchos failed to score any more runs in the inning leaving Jew on base after Highlander pitcher Trenton Toplikar got the next three outs in succession once he replaced Alex Fagalde who is now 6-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>The top half of the next frame, junior first baseman Austin Bush would come to the plate and smack a double to left center scoring two runs making the score 6-3 after seven innings. Bush would finish the day 2 for 4 with 4 RBI’s and has now has improved his hitting streak to five games.</p>\n<p>Again after failing to score more runs despite only having one out in the top of the seventh, the Gauchos had still cut into the lead leaving them with hope of a comeback. UCR took away that hope in the eighth inning as three runs were scored off of junior relief right-handed pitcher Alex Garcia who saw his first action since pitching 0.1 of an inning on April 11th against Nevada.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior catcher Tony Gudino netted two of the three runs with a single to right field before Contreras would attain his third RBI of the day off of another single. Contreras would finish the day 3 for 4 with three runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Not being able to muster even one out, Garcia came out having allowed the three runs. With the UCSB bullpen being the mess that it is, the Gauchos were forced to throw backup catcher Thomas Rowan on the mound to try to get out of the inning.</p>\n<p>Rowan did actually have experience pitching beforehand as in high school in his junior year he was 7-1 with a 1.81 ERA, but facing high schoolers and Division-I college athletes are completely different.</p>\n<p>To the redshirt sophomore’s credit, he did get out of the inning unscathed allowing only two hits but giving up no runs and actually striking out one batter. It was a great sight to see an athlete step up and make plays from a position he is not used too, but being in a position to have to throw Rowan out on the mound is proof of how bad things are in the pen for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final inning down 9-3, UCSB scored two more runs off of another Bush double, but it would obviously not be enough as it would fall 9-5.</p>\n<p>Once again, this loss is indicative of how the Gauchos have lost most of their games: their pitching staff. Being short-staffed is always tough, and having inconsistency from starters and relievers makes any coaches job tougher but UCSB needs to somehow make ends meet.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to miss the postseason which would be very disappointing, and at this point is basically an inevitability, but it’s another entirely if this team never even breaks the .500 bubble.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts has had a tough go at it this year, but having just been given a contract extension, we know he is here to stay, and at this point, him possibly being able to develop the young talent seems to be the only positive in UCSB baseball.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finish the series tomorrow at 2 p.m. at UCR stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It had been located at 971 Embarcadero Del Mar for 14 years and at 6578 Trigo Road for eight years before that, according to Alfonso Espino, Hempwise owner.</p>\n<p>“We were really all about kind of being a hub for the community and… being there for people who are interested in these types of things, especially alternative resources,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise closed its location in I.V. because their lease was not renewed by the owners of the lot. Espino hopes to move the shop to a new location in I.V. or Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[We have] been kind of scrambling for a new location and haven’t been able to find anything in I.V., but hopefully we’ll find something soon,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise had their last business day this past Monday and will be completely out of the building by the end of this month. Espino is still unsure when or where he will be able to open a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>SORRISO ITALIANO</strong></p>\n<p>The authentic Italian stop at 901 Embarcadero Del Mar closed in early June of this year, ending five years of business in I.V. with a wine tasting party.</p>\n<p>The owners, Antonio and Elisabetta Gerli, worked together in the restaurant, dividing the work between themselves. The long shifts and time taken away from family was a significant reason for closing, according to Antonio.</p>\n<p>“There are different reasons, but I think the most important was that my wife was the chef and I was in the front so we worked like 14 hours a day and we have a family,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>Sorriso also catered frequently for events for the UCSB Athletic Department.</p>\n<p>The couple recently accepted positions at Due Lune Cucina, an Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara. Antonio now works there as a manager and Elisabetta as executive chef. While they are enjoying the benefits of a lighter schedule, Antonio still reminisces on their time in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I miss Isla Vista because that was a great environment and good vibe, but you know, sometimes… you need to change your chapter of your life and we did it,” Gerli said.</p>\n<p><strong>KAPTAIN’S FIREHOUSE BBQ</strong></p>\n<p>Once wedged between Study Hall and Varsity Bike Shop at 6543 Pardall Road, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ shut down its location during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break in 2017.</p>\n<p>When it opened back in 2013, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ was a division of a larger company which also caters to festivals and large venues among other events.</p>\n<p>Despite its popularity in the early years as well as in other divisions of the company, the loss of popularity at the location in I.V. was a factor in its closure, according to Michael “The Kaptain” Gould, owner of the company.</p>\n<p>“For the first three years, we rocked it. We did really really really well. It was the last two years where it just became kind of stagnant,” The Kaptain said. “We made a couple changes to the menu, but it was kind of that I.V. rotation of restaurants that come through and it seemed like we had our run.”</p>\n<p>After expansions and growing success in the other divisions of his company, The Kaptain decided to close down the location in I.V. to concentrate on his other projects.</p>\n<p>“The easier thing to do would be to close I.V. and focus on, you know, where all our money was at.”</p>\n<p>The Kaptain recently opened a new division of his company which serves cold brew coffee and micro-brews at events, along with ribs, grilled wings and corn that was emblematic of the shack.</p>\n<p><em>Hiwi Tropical Fusion and Juice It Up, The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop and Rincon Brewery could not be reached for comment.</em></p>\n<p>While these businesses are closing their doors, new ones such as Hanamura on Embarcadero Del Mar, One Piece on Pardall Street and California Tacos and Taproom on Embarcadero del Norte have eagerly moved into their places.</p>\n<p><strong>CALIFORNIA TACOS AND TAPROOM</strong></p>\n<p>The fourth location of the Mexican fusion taco joint California Tacos and Taproom moved in the lot formerly occupied by The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop in August. Alex Uribe, the owner of the company, said he will be adding elements specifically designed for the demographic in Isla Vista, including televisions, 12 to 16 brews on tap and enhanced outdoor seating areas.</p>\n<p>“I think what was lacking before was a little bit of personality,” Uribe said. “I think that the students are looking for a good place to hang out, to have good food, a good atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Uribe is confident that the atmosphere of the restaurant and items of the menu will draw popularity to a notoriously unsuccessful property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Uribe, a UCSB alum, will also have his son, a current UCSB student, managing the restaurant and providing a student perspective on the business.</p>\n<p>“I used to go to UCSB a long time ago so I’m a little familiar with the area and although everything you know changes and evolves, I think I have a little bit better understanding than a regular person would come in and didn’t come to the school.”</p>\n<p>Uribe estimates California Tacos and Taproom will officially open around October 15 of this year.</p>\n<p><em>Hanamura and One Piece could not be reached for comment.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
