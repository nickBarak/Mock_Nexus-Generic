Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Days after putting forth one of its most impressive offensive performances this season in a loss at Long Beach State, the UCSB men’s basketball team hoped to display the same prowess at UC Riverside in order to achieve its first road win of the season.</p>\n<p>Although junior guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Eric Childress kept the Gauchos in the game for most of it, especially in the first half, fatigue caught up with them and the rest of the team, sending them back home with a 65-55 loss to the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>The 10-point loss drops Santa Barbara to 3-14 overall, matching its loss total from last season during which it finished 19-14. It also falls to 1-4 in the Big West and is now eighth place in the conference standings. UCR improves to 5-11 overall and, more importantly, is now over .500 in the Big West at 3-2, placing them in third place in the standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday’s loss at Riverside was yet another example of what the Gauchos are struggling with the most this season: making open shots from both beyond and inside the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot only 30.5 percent (18-59) from the field. Compare that to UCR’s 45.5 percent (25-55) from the field and it’s no shock as to why the home team won the matchup. Even with winning the rebounding battle at 41-36 and shooting much better from the free-throw line, Santa Barbara as a team was not as efficient from the field as UC Riverside, resulting in its eighth road loss of the year.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders were leading for most of the first half behind the great play of senior guard Malik Thames, who had nine points on 4-5 shooting. Luckily for the Gauchos, Vincent was also clutch in the first half with 11 points, including two three-pointers and scoring his 1,000th career point in his career as a Gaucho, becoming only the 28th player in school history to accomplish this feat.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at 25 with only 1:20 left in the first frame, Childress knocked down two FT’s to give his team a 27-25 lead. However, Santa Barbara then conceded seven straight points before the end of the half, including three by Thames, to go down 32-27 at the break.</p>\n<p>After retaking the lead late in the first half, the Highlanders never looked back, keeping the score in their favor until the end of the match. In stretches during which it played good defense, UCSB was unable to knock down a shot to really cut into the lead and threaten UCR. In the second half, Santa Barbara shot only 28.1 percent from the field while UC Riverside shot 48.1 percent. UCSB was able to stay in the game due to its ability to get to the line, where it shot 9-12 in the half.</p>\n<p>The last great chance the Gauchos had to make this a game was with 6:44 left in the contest. After two made free-throws by junior forward Alex Hart making the score 53-47, UCSB forced a turnover and had three solid looks at cutting the lead to four, its lowest margin since early in the second half, but were unable to capitalize. UCR scored on the next possession and finished the Gauchos off 65-55.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 55-point night was the second lowest point total of the season, with its worst being a loss at UC Davis 73-47. UCSB seems to be its own worst enemy in nights like these, forcing shots that are not there while also missing open shots that should result in points.</p>\n<p>Despite solid first-half performances, Childress only managed two second-half points, while Vincent did put up a solid seven but on a very inefficient 3-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>This season has been very tough for the Gauchos, but with over 10 games left in Big West play, they cannot afford to give up just yet. This UCSB team has shown flashes of greatness in its win over Cal Poly and even in some tough losses like at LBSU.</p>\n<p>With a team that has such potential and still has the third leading scorer in the conference in Vincent, this team is capable of making a run; it just needs a bit of a push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against CSUN at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The uncanny decline prompted the hiring of Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, who had spent the last 11 years coaching at the University of Kansas. In her first year, Henrickson and the Gauchos currently sit at 4-12 overall and 1-1 in conference play, exceeding their total of two wins last season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara won three consecutive games entering conference play for the first time since the 2012-13 season, on the heels of an eight-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“The record looks like we fell apart,” Henrickson said. “But in those stretches we had opportunities where we played pretty well and put ourselves in the position to win. We didn’t get it done, but we learned and grew from it. From the staff’s perspective, we respect the fact that every day they come back, no matter what the scoreboard says, and try to get it right.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kicked off conference play with a 78-67 win over Cal Poly before being outmatched by a superior UCR team 83-53 this past Saturday.</p>\n<p>Since scoring a career-high 27 points against Pepperdine earlier this season, sophomore guard Makala Roper was placed in the starting lineup and continues to emerge as a primary scorer for the Gauchos. She leads UCSB in scoring with an average of 12.1 points per game. Roper also holds the team-high in 20-point games with three.</p>\n<p>Despite Roper’s rise in production, the loss of freshman forward Kali Jones certainly affects UCSB’s presence in the paint. She has missed the team’s last five games and has been ruled indefinitely ineligible for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have somebody that produces at the five,” Henrickson said. “At the end of the day it’s about production. We have Kendra, Mi’Chael, Chaya and Je Zhé Newton at the five, but we just have not got the production that I know we’re going to need to be successful in a league that’s this talented.”</p>\n<p>UCSB received the least amount of votes in the Big West women’s basketball preseason poll and is expected to finish last in the standings. Yet, the Gauchos are playing their best basketball entering the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continues conference play tonight on the road against Cal State Fullerton at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii by Michael Jorgenson </strong></p>\n<p>The Hawaii women’s basketball team came into this year as the clear favorite to finish atop the conference, collecting 13 of 17 first place votes in the preseason coaches’ poll. The Rainbow Wahine were coming off a season in which they dominated conference play, going 23-9 overall and 14-2 Big West as they won their first regular season conference title since the 1993-94 season.</p>\n<p>However, reigning Big West Coach of the Year Laura Beeman and her team have found how difficult it is to repeat success from one season to the next. Hawaii has managed only a middling 8-7 overall, 1-1 conference record to this point, sitting at fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine lost two starters from last year, including their leading scorer guard Shawna-Lei Kuehu — the team’s only double-digit scorer. This year, they are led by senior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, a second team All-Big West selection in 2015.</p>\n<p>Karaitiana, the team’s top threat from deep, struggled mightily with her shot through her team’s nonconference schedule, hitting just 17.5 percent on three-point attempts. As a result, she comes in as just the team’s third-leading scorer at 8.1 points per game, behind sophomore center Megan Huff and senior guard/forward Destiny King, who average 8.2 and 9.8 ppg, respectively.</p>\n<p>Karaitiana seems to have gotten hot at the right time with conference play starting, as she has made 6-14 (42.9 percent) through the opening two games.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has not been able to find the rhythm on offense that saw it drop just two conference games in 2015, as it currently ranks fifth in scoring at 60.5 points a night. A big reason for this has been the team’s three-point shooting, which is second-worst in the league at 25.4 percent.</p>\n<p>However, its defense has been able to keep it in games, as it ranks first in opponent three-point shooting (25.4 percent) and opponent scoring (61.2 ppg).</p>\n<p>While it is still early, the Rainbow Wahine will need to improve if they are going to find a way to repeat as regular season champs and win the Big West Tournament. Getting the offense going may be the key, as they have allowed just 1.1 ppg more to opponents compared to last year while scoring 7.3 ppg less.</p>\n<p>Hawaii plays its third conference game tonight against Cal State Northridge in the Stan Sheriff Center at 9:00 p.m. PST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside by Daniel Moebus-Bowles </strong></p>\n<p>After taking home a big win on the road against Grand Canyon University, the UC Riverside women’s basketball team pushed back up to an even record of 7-7 to conclude the nonconference portion of their season. The Highlanders’ record placed them in the middle of the Big West standings at fifth place to enter the conference schedule, but their rank and record proved to not have any influence on their play to start the second half of the season.</p>\n<p>UCR is now 9-7, 2-0 in Big West play after victories over UC Irvine in its conference opener and UCSB last Saturday, extending its winning streak to three games. Riverside is now just one of two teams in the conference that boast an undefeated record through two conference games, its first 2-0 start since the 2007-08 season.</p>\n<p>“Conference play is a whole other animal,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We had a very good schedule and if we learn from the teams we played and the games that we had, it will pay off for us in the Big West. We just need to focus on playing four quarters of basketball.”</p>\n<p>One of the Highlanders’ strong points this year has been their offense, as they have found most of their wins coming with high scores and large leads. So far this season, the team has averaged 75.4 points per game, and in their nine victories, that figure increases to 85.5 points. Those wins were not only high-scoring, but also dominated by Riverside, who has beaten every opponent by an average 21.0 points.</p>\n<p>“We have been very offensive-minded so far, which has led us to some of our big wins,” Margaritis explained. “Now we are looking to strengthen the defensive end of our game.”</p>\n<p>The team’s roster is decorated with three former Big West Freshman of the Year recipients, multiple members of Big West All-Conference teams and last year’s Big West Player of the Year. The all-around talent that this team possesses makes them a very deep and tough unit to break.</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Player of the Year, senior guard Brittany Crain, is joined by junior transfer forward Réjane Verin at the top of the scorers list, as they lead the team with averages of 19.2 and 17.3 point per game, respectively. Senior guard Annelise Ito also complements Riverside’s offense as she leads the team in assists at 4.9 per game, is second in boards at 7.1 and third in points at 13.5. These three players account for a majority of the team’s statistics, but Margaritis explains that their success is a complete team effort.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just talk about a couple players when you think of this team — you really can’t leave any of them out of the discussion,” Margaritis said. “We have a whole team, and all of our players together are very difficult to play against.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders hope to continue their great start to conference play in their next game at Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 16 at 9:00 p.m. in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly by Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>Ending last season on a bitter note with a first-round loss to Cal State Fullerton, Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh and the Cal Poly Mustangs look to make a deeper push in the Big West Tournament this year with a more experienced squad.</p>\n<p>Predicted to finish third in the Big West according to the conference media polls, the Mustangs are currently 8-7 overall and 1-1 in Big West play after a loss to Blue-Green rival UCSB and a win at UC Irvine. Since the departures of former seniors Kristen Ale, Taryn Garza and Ariana Elegado, expectations have been placed upon senior guard Beth Balbierz and junior forward Hannah Gilbert to fill their absence on the team.</p>\n<p>“Our pieces have changed [this year] and certainly they are significant pieces, but the main phases of our program are still intact,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>Certainly, there’s no avoiding the loss of players each season, and Cal Poly has maintained its prominence in the Big West by finishing in the top three or better of the conference for seven straight seasons.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ combination of Gilbert in the post and Balbierz at guard has been a consistent scoring force, as the two rank eighth and 11th in the conference with averages of 12.8 and 11.9 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>Gilbert, a two-year starter, led the conference in field-goal percentage last season at .526 percent. The 6’3” junior has proven to be a mismatch down low, scoring 15 points or more in four games this year, including a team-high 23-point outing in the Mustangs’ win over Sac State. Gilbert also leads the Big West in rebounds with 9.9 per game.</p>\n<p>After starting six games during her first two seasons, Balbierz has finally embraced a leadership role in Cal Poly’s backcourt. Leading the team with 23 makes from downtown this year, Mimnaugh will utilize Balbierz’s shooting ability to spread the floor and give more opportunities for Gilbert down low.</p>\n<p>“[Beth] has been waiting her turn playing the sixth man role during previous years,” Mimnaugh said. “Her intelligence on the court has been a savior for [us]. Beth has always had the ability to shoot the three, but she also added driving and passing skills to her repertoire this year, so we are very pleased with that.”</p>\n<p>Gilbert and Balbierz will be central components to the Mustangs’ success this year. The Mustangs will go as far as the two upperclassmen carry their team.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will face Cal State Fullerton in its conference home opener on Saturday, Jan. 16 at 4:00 p.m. at Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge by Jorge Mercado  </strong></p>\n<p>Coming off a great 23-win season a year ago and an NCAA Tournament bid, the two-time defending Big West Tournament Champion Cal State Northridge Matadors were hoping for another great season. However, they have struggled mightily, mustering only a 2-13 overall, 0-1 conference record and are currently in the midst of a five-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>“We want to just continue to get better each day,” Head Coach Jason Flowers said. “Daily improvement is constantly our focus.”</p>\n<p>The Matadors are currently tied for the worst record in the Big West with CSUF after falling to UC Davis 75-52 in their conference opener. With no seniors on the team, this inexperienced young roster has not been able to produce wins.</p>\n<p>They also faced a very difficult nonconference schedule with games against tough opponents such as No. 21 California, Utah, Georgia and Idaho. They were outscored by those four opponents by an average of 46 points per game, with Cal and Idaho each scoring 106 points in those matchups.</p>\n<p>“We challenged ourselves with our nonconference schedule,” Flowers said, “and found out how much we need to improve to get to the level we strive to attain.”</p>\n<p>Another reason for CSUN’s tough start is the graduation of their two top guards from a year ago, Ashlee Guay and Janae Sharpe. Both were named to the Big West Conference All-Tournament Team, while Guay was awarded with MVP honors.</p>\n<p>Even though the team has been underwhelming to this point, they are still contenders in the Big West. The Matadors still have a great head coach in Flowers, who has twice been named the Big West Conference Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>CSUN also retained Big West All-Freshman forward Tessa Boagni, who currently leads the team in scoring with 12.4 points per game, which is ninth best in the conference, and shooting, knocking down 48.4 percent of her shots.</p>\n<p>However, in order to truly turn this season around, the Matadors will need to take better care of the ball. They currently average 18.5 turnovers per game, fourth worst in the Big West. They will also need to play better on defense, as they rank last in the conference, allowing marks of 79.9 ppg and 46 percent shooting to opponents.</p>\n<p>“We have grown in various areas throughout this season,” Flowers said. “We will continue to do so through March.”</p>\n<p>CSUN plays its second conference game today at Hawaii at 9 p.m. PST in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State by Antonia Bird</strong></p>\n<p>After putting together one of the most outstanding seasons in recent history in 2014-15, the Long Beach State women’s basketball team is eager to make history again.</p>\n<p>Their 22-10 overall record last season was the team’s best since 1990-91. Moreover, their 13-1 nonconference record last season was the best in school history.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is in the midst of another solid start as it heads into Big West play, currently standing at 12-4 overall and 1-1 in conference. The conference’s opening weekend saw the 49ers fall against Hawaii 67-55 before blowing out Cal State Fullerton 82-61 on the road. With such an impressive early record, Long Beach appears set to repeat last year’s success and will once again be the team to beat.</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ biggest threats are junior guards Raven Benton and Jewelyn Sawyer. Each are well-rounded players who play crucial roles in the team’s success.</p>\n<p>After sitting out the last eight games of her sophomore year due to an injury, Benton has proven herself ready in these first 14 games of her junior season. She leads her team with 13.1 points per game and is second with an average of 5.3 rebounds per game. She is off to a hot start in conference play, averaging 20 points a night while shooting 50 percent from the field and 63.6 percent from three-point range.</p>\n<p>Teammate Jewelyn Sawyer is yet another option for Long Beach, as she holds the second best average for points per game with 10.5. She saw an impressive game high of 16 points in the 49ers’ nonconference finale against Seattle two weeks ago. Sawyer’s biggest advantage is her ability to rebound, as she currently leads the team with 6.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s next game will be at UC Irvine this Saturday at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis by Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>After its loss in the semi-finals of last year’s Big West Tournament, the UC Davis women’s basketball team has entered conference play with the intent of landing near or at the top of the standings at the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p>“We are all competitive and would love to win a championship, but the ultimate goal is to make sure our players are growing,” UC Davis Head Coach Jennifer Gross said.</p>\n<p>The Aggies finished in fifth place in the Big West last season with an 8-8 record (15-16 overall), but most of the team’s stars returned this year. Senior forward Alyson Doherty was named to the preseason All-Conference team prior to this season, and two games into Big West play, she is leading the Aggies with averages of 6.5 rebounds and 1.67 blocks per game. She is also second on the team in scoring, averaging 13.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>The team’s leading scorer is forward Morgan Bertsch with an average of 13.4 ppg. The redshirt freshman has come alive in recent weeks, as she notched three 20-point performances in December and forced her way into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>“Alyson Doherty and Celia Marfone have played a lot of minutes for us since their freshmen year,” Gross said. “This year we have asked them to be more vocal on the court and help set the tone with consistent effort and energy.”</p>\n<p>Gross has been at the helm of the Aggies’ coaching staff for five years after playing her collegiate career in Davis. After four years with the Doherty-led senior class, the coach believes the team’s upperclassmen are setting a good example for the younger stars.</p>\n<p>“They are well respected amongst their teammates and have a strong voice, especially when assisting some of our younger players,” Gross said.</p>\n<p>Three underclassmen, including Bertsch and sophomores Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh, are among the top five in minutes per game for UCD. If freshman breakout Bertsch is regularly able to put up big numbers, she will be an early contender for the Big West Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>“This preseason provided us with so many opportunities to grow, and we have improved in a lot of areas, but understand that we still have a lot of work to do,” Gross said. “There is still so much time to improve and I am excited to see where this team can be in March.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton by Sinead Leon </strong></p>\n<p>With Big West play upon us, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team is looking to break their 13-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>After being voted to finish sixth in this year’s preseason coach’s poll, the Titans finished their nonconference schedule in eighth place with an overall record of 2-12 and have since lost their conference opener to Long Beach State 82-61.</p>\n<p>“We are an extremely young team learning the differences between high school and college basketball,” Head Coach Daron Park said. “I think we have the potential to be a very competitive team in the Big West Conference — I just don’t know when that light will click on for them.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Fullerton averaged 59.7 points per game, but its weakness was mainly that it lacked defense and in return would allow 62.6 on average.</p>\n<p>To top it off, the Titans have been faced with having to replace more than half of their offensive production from last year with the loss of two of the Big West’s top scorers in graduated seniors Chante Miles and Kathleen Iwuoha.</p>\n<p>Someone who is doing a fine job at that is guard/forward Michelle Berry, who began conference play with four double-doubles. In the last conference game against North Dakota State, the freshman scored 16 points while also leading the team with four assists.</p>\n<p>Another new face to watch out for is freshman guard Lauren Nubla. She led her high school team to the CIF Division I Championship Title, was named Athlete of the Year and received the CIF Sportsmanship Award in her senior year with 246 points and 14 three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Nubla scored a season-high11 points in the Titans’ last nonconference game of the season.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited about Lauren and her contributions so far this season,” Park said. “She is another freshman playing significant minutes and being asked to shoulder upperclassman responsibility. I expect her to continue to grow and develop as a player as conference play begins.”</p>\n<p>The Titans look to climb out of the bottom spot where they have ended up the last couple of years, continuing their conference schedule with their second Big West game against UCSB tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Titan Gym in Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine by Xavier Cardenas </strong></p>\n<p>The Anteaters were predicted to finish eighth in the conference by the Big West Media Preseason Poll and are experiencing a downward trend since the start of the Big West schedule. Irvine’s six-game slump prior to entering conference play has now extended to eight consecutive games after losses to UC Riverside and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters concluded the nonconference portion of their season with an overall record of 3-11, but are now 3-13, 0-2 after the pair of Big West losses. Although they have suffered losses against tough opponents such as USC, UCLA and Princeton, UCI has shown resilience.</p>\n<p>“They are a resilient group — we have not played good basketball [during this stretch]. It’s unfortunate, but we have not been playing well offensively and we cannot score,” Head Coach Doug Oliver said. “Until that turns around, we will not be competitive.”</p>\n<p>However, Oliver remains optimistic about UCI’s remaining schedule, maintaining the mindset of taking it one game at a time. Despite Irvine’s struggles during nonconference play and its winless start to its Big West schedule, the hope is that the Anteaters will hit their stride throughout the remainder of conference play.</p>\n<p>“Usually at this point teams have developed an identity, and we are struggling to come up with who we are,” Oliver said. “Seasons are in parts — nonconference, season and postseason. We got through the nonconference part of play, and it didn’t go our way, but let’s move on.”</p>\n<p>Currently the Anteaters are the second worst scoring team in the conference at 57.9 ppg and are last in field goal percentage at 34.7 percent. As its offense struggles to produce, Irvine will depend on its defense to create plays on the other end of the court.</p>\n<p>“Our concentration is on our defensive effort — really, for us it’s rebounding,” said Oliver. “We play a lot more zone defense than other teams, which causes issues on rebounds. If we break even on rebounds we will make open shots.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding is most important for UC Irvine and it will need the efforts of All-Conference forward junior Mokun Fajemisin. Fajemisin has recorded 25 blocks and is averaging 7.9 rebounds per game, placing her second and third respectively in Big West in both statistical categories.</p>\n<p>With hopes to turn things around, the Anteaters’ next game will be against UC Davis on Thursday, Jan. 14 at 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*All stats accurate as of 1/13/16</p>\n<p>A version of this article was published in January 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/womens-basketball-big-west-preview/","id":380,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[379,378,377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn Second Consecutive Win in Final Non-Conf.

It earned a 76.7 free throw percentage versus Morehead State, scoring half of 8-2 run to open the game at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Her best performance since being placed within the Gauchos’ starting lineup, sophomore forward Chaya Durr scored a career-high 18 points while tallying six rebounds and a team-high two blocks. Both her and junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe shot 3-3 from the field in the first quarter. Jemerigbe ended the contest with 14 points.</p>\n<p>However, matching UCSB’s quick start was the Eagles’ sophomore forward Eriel McKee and freshman guard Miranda Crockett. Crocket scored a game-high 27 points and seven assists while McKee registered a double-double with 21 points and 11 rebounds. The two combined for 18 points in the first quarter on 50 percent shooting but could not prevent UCSB’s 26-21 lead at the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB achieve its 46.5 shooting percentage was its production off the bench as well. Senior guard Jasmine Ware and sophomore forward Taylor Farris provided 27 of the team’s 29 bench points.</p>\n<p>Farris notched a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, her second consecutive game with double-figure rebounds, while Ware scored 17 points on a 6-9 shooting effort. Helping the Gauchos maintain their narrow lead was senior forward Kendra Morrison who grabbed six rebounds in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>As both teams traded points throughout the quarter, it was UCSB’s success at the free throw line (8-10) that allowed it to have a 46-42 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ improved defense in the second half enabled their splurge of points in the second half as they took their first double-figure lead in 7:37 mark of the third quarter. As UCSB held Morehead St. to an overall field goal percentage of 38.5 percent, Ware’s 10 points in the third quarter extended UCSB’s lead to 72-59.</p>\n<p>Adding to the spectacular efforts of Crockett and McKee, redshirt junior guard Brianna McQueen scored 16 points, but was the only player besides the two that made an effective contribution to the Eagles’ attempt at a comeback.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos’ lead continued to expand as they recorded their best shooting percentage in the fourth quarter at 52.9 percent. UCSB earned its largest lead with 3:37 remaining in regulation at 85-64, leading it to its 93-78 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin its Big West Conference schedule in the New Year, hosting Cal Poly on Thursday, Jan. 7<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-29/gauchos-earn-second-consecutive-win-in-final-non-conf-game-93-78-over-morehead-st/","id":381,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[380,379,378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry to Start Big West Play for UCSB on Thursday, Continues with UCR on Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_9-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The non-conference schedule is wrapped up and conference play has arrived!

The Highlanders are 7-7, but have a losing record on the road of 3-6. While Riverside last played on Saturday, both UCSB and Cal Poly should be well rested having not played in over a week.</p>\n<p>“It’s been nice to have this much practice time to clean up things,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Sometimes when you play so frequently and don’t get enough practice, you get game slippage. We’ve just got to work on us, honestly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the indefinite ineligibility of freshman forward Kali Jones, UCSB has been forced to play with a smaller lineup. However, in three games without Jones, the Gauchos have surpassed their season average of 35.9 rebounds per game with an average of 47.6. They are 2-1 and have outrebounded each of its opponents, recording consecutive season-highs of 49 versus La Verne and a season-best 58 versus Morehead St.</p>\n<p>While UCSB seems to have established its presence on the boards, it will be tested in the paint by Cal Poly’s junior forward Hannah Gilbert. Despite the graduation of former two-time All-Big West First Team selection, guard Ariana Elegado, Gilbert has embraced a bigger role as the Mustangs have become more active in getting the ball in the paint.</p>\n<p>Her 52.6 field goal percentage led the Big West last season and she currently leads the conference in rebounding with an average of 9.6 boards per game, ranking 35<sup>th</sup> in the nation in addition to being second on the team in scoring, averaging 12.2 ppg. Gilbert also is atop the conference in double-doubles with five on the season and recently earned Big West Player of the Week honors for achieving career-highs in points and rebounds with 23 and 17. Her career night helped Cal Poly break its single-game school record for rebounds with a total of 74, surpassing the former record of 67.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s physicality and ability to consistently box out in the paint will be key in denying the Mustangs of having an advantage on the boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s matchup versus UC Riverside on Saturday will be the end of a four-game home stretch before heading back onto the road. Santa Barbara looks to end another losing streak this weekend as it has loss the last three meetings to Riverside.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent a fourth-straight loss, the Gauchos must contain UCR’s lethal scoring offense. The Highlanders lead the Big West in points per game (73.6), field goal percentage (43.6), assists per game (18.6- 11<sup>th</sup> nationally), free throw percentage (72.7), three-point percentage (35.1- 49<sup>th</sup> nationally) and commit the fewest turnovers with an average of 15.4 per game.</p>\n<p>In addition to its No. 11 national ranking in assists per game, Riverside ranks seventh in the country in total assists with 260 this season while ranking 23<sup>rd</sup> with a 1.21 assists turnover ratio.</p>\n<p>The share of wealth on offense lands three Highlanders — senior guards Brittany Crain and Annelise Ito as well as redshirt junior forward Réjane Verin— within the top five scorers of the Big West.</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that the reigning Big West Player of the Year in Crain is atop the conference in scoring (17.6 ppg)  after ranking 11<sup>th</sup> in the nation and first in the Big West in points per game last season with an average of 21.7. She also ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point percentage at 36.6 percent.</p>\n<p>Ahead of Crain by a margin of .03 is UNLV transfer and former Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year, Verin, who’s 17.9 ppg leads the conference while she also ranks second in field goal percentage (49.5) and fourth in rebounds per game (7.9).</p>\n<p>In the team’s last game against Grand Canyon University, Crain and Verin both recorded double-double performances of 20 points and 10 rebounds, a milestone that hadn’t been achieved by a pair of UCR players since 2013.</p>\n<p>Completing the Highlanders trio of scoring alongside Crain in the backcourt is Ito. Her averages of 12.8 ppg and 7.1 rebounds per game ranks fifth in the Big West while she leads the team’s foundation of assists with an average of 4.9 per game which stands second in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCR is loaded on the offensive end, which will call for a big game from UCSB’s top scorers in sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Roper leads the Gauchos in scoring at an average of 12.1 ppg while Miller is second on the team at 9.2 ppg. Both are tied for the team lead in most games with double figures scored at seven while Roper has the edge of one game over Miller for most 20-point games at three.</p>\n<p>If Roper and Miller can manage to stay engaged and provide UCSB with scoring on offense throughout an entirety of four quarters, the Gauchos may be able to close out their conference opening weekend with a victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s conference opener will be Henrickson’s introduction to the Big West after spending just over a decade at the University of Kansas. Although the Big West isn’t one of the powerhouse conferences like the Big 12, Henrickson maintains the same mentality despite the change in conference.</p>\n<p>“I have great respect for the Big West,” she said. “You have quality coaches. I appreciate and respect teams that play the game it’s supposed to be played. This time of the year, you either get better or you get worse, nobody stays the same. It’d be a disservice and disrespectful if I coached them [UCSB] any differently.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest versus Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. while Saturday’s game on Jan. 9 versus UC Riverside will take place at 4:00 p.m. Both games will be played in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67198\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67198\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/blue-green-rivalry-to-start-big-west-play-for-ucsb-on-thursday-continues-with-ucr-on-saturday/","id":382,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[381,380,379],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
