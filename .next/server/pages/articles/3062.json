President Janet Napolitano.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke about safety preparations for Isla Vista’s notoriously massive Halloween festivities. Moore reported the idea of temporary fencing he hoped to install along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive to prevent cliff fall injuries or deaths was shut down due to funding issues as well as liability concerns, from the University’s Office of Risk Management.</p>\n<p>Moore said he was frustrated with the decision but is determined to continue working on the issue, as he remains confident in achieving future success.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be moving forward to negotiate with the county on some sort of framework or method, so that this doesn’t happen again [and] so that we can always have temporary fencing during high-risk events,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned the Festival ordinance that will be in effect from this Saturday until Nov. 4, saying he and other groups are working to make students aware of the ordinance and other changes. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure folks don’t get an unnecessary ticket,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said hydration stations and portable bathrooms will be set up for each night of Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, executive officers and public forum speakers delivered reports on their recent accomplishments and upcoming activities.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud discussed his recent meeting with new U.C. President Napolitano in Oakland on Monday during his report, in which he expressed positive results that included promises from her to meet with the elected members of campus governments in person once a quarter and to speak to them on the phone once per month.</p>\n<p>In addition, Abboud said he was pleased with their success in getting Napolitano to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>“She did well, in terms of answering what we wanted but we did corner her on a couple of things we wanted … like Prop 13,” Abboud said. “So we got her to admit that Prop 13 is one of the reasons tuition has gotten so high.”</p>\n<p>Along with the passing of a few minor bills, the meeting tabled a bill sending directives to Napolitano. Towards the end of the meeting, Senators debated the bill, concluding they would clarify the language and demands of the drafted proposal and vote on it next week.</p>\n<p>One section of the bill prohibits the use of U.C. funds to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Senator Nikki Calderon, currently no U.C. funds go toward assisting ICE, but the bill ensures that these funds will not be used in the future. This section Calderon said, serves to secure that the funding “may not be happening, but it will not happen also.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting included a tree-planting event Saturday at Goleta Valley Beautiful, planned homeless assistance in I.V. provided by Pescadero Lofts and efforts to make the dining commons Kosher-friendly. For next week’s meeting, Senate members will come dressed in their Halloween costumes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This story is a </em>Daily Nexus<em> online exclusive.</em></p><div

and develop tangible action in a community. It will be offered only through the UCSB extension program.</p>\n<p>Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager and Santa Barbara City College trustee, designed the course. He will be teaching it this spring with the help of occasional guest speakers.</p>\n<p>Abboud recently submitted a tentative syllabus for the class in the form of a proposal, which, if approved, will allow him to the class to run next quarter.</p>\n<p>“I’m really looking forward to it because I know it is going to be hard this first time doing it, but it is a way for me to pass on what I’ve learned,” Abboud said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>This is not his first experience teaching a course at UCSB, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>In Winter Quarter 2014, he taught a course called “Politics of the University of California” where students learned about the inner workings of the university and its role on a statewide platform.</p>\n<p>On top of teaching at UCSB, Abboud also has experience in the area of grassroots campaigning, which he developed both in and out of school.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Abboud launched multiple successful grassroots campaigns, which ultimately led to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/csd-takes-first-steps-in-i-v-governance/\">formation of I.V. CSD</a>.</p>\n<p>The director of UCSB’s Leadership and Advocacy Program, Patricia Fancher, initially approached Abboud to create a syllabus and teach a class on campaign design.</p>\n<p>Although the course name implies campaigning, that is not necessarily what the class is about, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>“When people use the word campaigning, they probably mean going out and getting votes, but that’s not what this class is for… The class is about how to build support for your idea and advance it.”</p>\n<p>The class will take place over 10 weeks, during which students will work toward creating a campaign portfolio. The portfolio will include a plan to campaign either on campus or in I.V. “to enact some positive change” in their respective communities, according to the syllabus proposal.</p>\n<p>Each week of the class will highlight a different component of the campaigning process – ranging from volunteer recruitment to branding and communications – in order add more tools to students’ campaigning belts, according to the syllabus.</p>\n<p>The course is structured similarly to that of most courses at UCSB, but places a heavier emphasis on technical skills and less on theories, said Abboud.</p>\n<p>“The class does have some theory in it, but a lot of it is going to be more practical skills based, like how to facilitate a meeting or how to do a power map. Hopefully people can take the things they learn in their theory classes and see how they relate to this.”</p>\n<p>Although the class doesn’t begin until April, Abboud has high hopes along with some nerves.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had some experience to make this less scary than it can be, but it definitely is an exciting opportunity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Human Rights Board, emphasizing the confusing process by which Napolitano was elected and the threat they believe she poses to members of the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“We, the UC Santa Barbara Human Rights Board, stand in solidarity with communities that have been attacked and further marginalized under the leadership of Napolitano during her term as Secretary of Homeland Security,” Ahuja and Abu Ata stated. “We aim to create a safe space and advocate for all students, regardless of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientation and classes. We work to pressure the University to uphold these standards and qualities of fair and equal treatment.”</p>\n<p>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS said passing the resolution would show solidarity with other UC campuses that have already passed similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“Passing a vote of ‘no confidence’ — it has so much weight in terms of being in solidarity with other Campuses and being able to say UC Santa Barbara will have no confidence with you because of your history,” Campos said. “These concerns are valid. I don’t know how else to convince you all.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Norma Orozco said the resolution presented a critical opportunity for the senate to take a definitive stand on a pressing issue.<br>\n“At UCSB I’ve seen a lot of student politicians, and A.S. is supposed to be a place for everyone. It’s supposed to be a place that creates student leaders. I really want you all to take this idea really to mind, to heart…as a leader,” Orozco said.</p>\n<p>Following public forum and administrative tasks, senators debated the resolution themselves. Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield said that public forum showed how little opposition there was to the resolution, and that he could not see clear negative consequences to it.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have students saying that they oppose this resolution coming to the senate,” Wakefield said. “Voting yes on this would not be negative. No students are going to be suffering if we say yes.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Off-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal said he did not feel the demands outlined in the resolution directly applied to Napolitano’s role as UC President.</p>\n<p>“The most important part should be the demands that were made,” Villarreal said. “I don’t feel that the demands actually fall under Napolitano’s job description.”</p>\n<p>Senator Amir Khazaieli said he doubted the bill would yield tangible results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like this bill for one main reason, not because of the ‘no confidence’ clause but mainly because it fails to introduce tangible results that will change our campus for the better,” Khazaieli said. “Let’s make some directives and let’s add it to the resolution.”</p>\n<p>Other senators took issue with the “aggressive” language of the bill, such as Off-Campus Senator Jake Orens, who felt that Napolitano should be given a chance to act as president before being attacked.</p>\n<p>“I think she has a chance and I think the bill can be revised…but I just don’t feel comfortable with how aggressive it is,” Orens said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said the aggressive tone is actually a point in favor of the bill.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think being aggressive is necessarily a bad thing,” Theus said. “I have seen so many things come out of the senate office…because of decisions that were aggressive but that needed to happen…A lot of things aren’t ever going to change in the world if you’re not being aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice Contreras, who authored the resolution, urged the senators to move to a vote and let their vote speak for them. After the vote, Contreras said the decision could set a dangerous precedent for the Senate.</p>\n<p>“I feel like from now on, [members of the communities affected by the resolution] are going to be very hesitant about approaching us, they’re going to be very hesitant about asking us anything, hesitant about us representing them,” Contreras said. “We have to earn their trust and their respect back.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/a-s-senate-fails-to-pass-no-confidence-resolution/","id":3060,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3059,3058,3057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Now her track record is making many students question her ability to prioritize the needs of undocumented UC students, and various students groups — such as Human Rights Board, the Black Student Union and UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (a coalition of undocumented students) — all formally denounced her appointment at yesterday’s Senate meeting.</div>\n<div>Napolitano was appointed by the UC Regents to replace Mark Yudof as UC President in July, with all but Student Regent Cinthia Flores voting in favor of her appointment.</div>\n<div>At Public Forum, students and other community members voiced support for a unified resolution called “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students and Immigrant Communities,” which presents several demands to recently appointed Napolitano. The Resolution concludes by stating that, if passed, the Senate expresses “no confidence” in Napolitano’s ability to perform as UC President. However, as of press time, Senate decided to not vote on the issue and wait until next week to reach a final decision.</div>\n<div>Katlen Abuata of Human Rights Board was the first to approach the A.S. Senate with her support of the resolution, and Abuata said Napolitano’s appointment jeopardizes the safety of certain minority communities on campus.</div>\n<div>“You all are here and you have the extreme privilege of representing a diverse group of students; some of these students are undocumented,” Abuata said. “Some of these students have a fear of having a leader of their UC system being someone that deported hundreds of thousands of people.”</div>\n<div>Second-year Mohsin Mirza, who also came on behalf of HRB, said the process by which Napolitano was selected does not reflect the interests of the general UC student population.</div>\n<div>“I think we need to highlight the fact that her appointment in the first place was completely undemocratic,” Mirza said. “None of [the potential candidates] have any experience with education … As student leaders here, you’re asked to represent the students … I don’t see a group here saying ‘We love Napolitano. We want her to be here.’”</div>\n<div>Gloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS provided a personal testimony of her experience as an undocumented student, explaining why she felt Napolitano was a detrimental influence to the UC system.</div>\n<div>“I am an undocumented student. I was at that meeting yesterday with Napolitano,” Campos said.  “I can’t say how I felt … to have someone that has caused so much damage to our community — not only students who are undocumented, but students who aren’t undocumented who have parents [who] are undocumented … I don’t know if you can understand what that feels like to have her as our new UC president.”</div>\n<div>Liam Stanton, another student at Public Forum, provided another perspective on the resolution. While Stanton said he disagreed with Napolitano’s appointment, he urged Senators to move forward through open negotiations, rather than a vote of no confidence.</div>\n<div>“The reality of it is that now she is the president of the UC system,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe that an utter show of no confidence gets us anywhere.”</div>\n<div>Fourth-year Norma Orozco also came to Public Forum to stress the negative impact of Napolitano’s appointment on undocumented students at UCSB, saying that UCSB should value their undocumented community.</div>\n<div>“This year, in fact, we have the largest amount of undocumented population at UCSB, and it’s something to be proud of,” Orozco said. “It is our duty, our responsibility, and it is our right to tell her that we have no confidence in her.”</div>\n<div>Chancellor Henry T. Yang also spoke at the meeting, assuring the student body that he would be available for any necessary support. Additionally, Off-Campus Senator Jake Speyer announced he would be transferring schools after Fall Quarter, and therefore resigning from his senatorial position, which means the candidate who received the next most votes during last spring’s elections will be offered the position.</div>\n<div>The executive officers presented their first reports for the coming school year, announcing what projects would be released from their respective offices. These include renovations to the UCen, a student-led classes initiative, a waitlist system to be implemented on UCSB GOLD and a visit by President Napolitano to the campus in November, at which students will be able to directly address her with concerns.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>This article appeared on page 4 of Thursday October 3, 2013′s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[CORRECTION: The print version of this article was incorrectly titled, “A.S.
