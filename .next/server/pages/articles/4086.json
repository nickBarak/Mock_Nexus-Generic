But the women of UCSB Taara — a dance team performing South Asian dance styles — had already decided they wouldn’t place at the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were so many amazing teams and we had accepted it. We were like, ‘You know what, we’re going to get last. And that’s okay,’” Natasha Nema, one of the group’s four founding members, said. “We were genuinely fine with getting last because we just couldn’t even believe that we were there in the first place against that many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group had been together for less than a year, and after scoping out the competition, they thought they didn’t stand a chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really weren’t even listening, cause we were like, ‘Oh, we don’t really care. Like, yeah, we’ll listen for second and first, sure. But third place, we don’t really care,” Nema recalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the judges announced the winners –– they placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t even comprehend that our name was being spoken, that we just paused for a little bit. And then we screamed, it was like two seconds later,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In less than a year since the group’s inception in June 2018, the four hopeful members became a winning team of 12 in their dream competition. That was in March 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, in February 2020, UCSB Taara took first place at Bollywood Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This June, the four original members of UCSB Taara –– Nema, Shivani Shah, Sejal Chandra and Jashanna Walia –– graduated from UCSB and said goodbye to the group they envisioned, nurtured and led to victory over two years. For those four women, leaving Taara “Gen One,” or what they call the first generation of UCSB Taara dancers, meant leaving a lasting legacy at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have our literal legacy on this campus and a part of us still at UCSB forever, I think, to me at least, is really, really special. It’s like a home you’ll always have when you visit campus and a bond you’ll always be a part of, no matter how old you get,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia recently passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, but they expect to watch the group progress for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t even imagine being old enough to see Taara Gen 10 … It’s changed so much in just two years that I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like in another two years,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning in the summer of 2018, the girls buckled down in brand building and recruiting efforts. They decided on their official name –– Taara, which means star in Hindi –– designed a logo, ordered team jerseys and hired a DJ to create a dance mix for their group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema handled the marketing side, which meant legitimizing the team, recruiting new members and defining their style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really wanted for people to take us seriously within the circuit because there were already so many amazing teams.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating Taara, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia were all in other Bollywood or Bhangra dance groups at UCSB but had frustrations with the groups’ leadership. So the four decided to create their own group: a competitive, all-female team that fused the styles of Bollywood, Bhangra, hip-hop and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But starting a new group meant that Taara didn’t have a proven reputation to help recruit dancers. New members would have to take a leap of faith, and the original four had to convince recruits  that Taara could go the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How do we get all these new people to trust us? How do we get these people to commit 20 hours a week, at least, of dancing, to get them to the next place where we can compete and where we can prove ourselves?” Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nema took to social media, scouring Facebook pages for incoming freshmen and potential recruits, and even went as far as downloading dating apps. Some of the others made friends with dancers already in the competition circuit, Desi Dance Network, to learn insider tips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At tryouts later that year, Taara accepted 12 new members, bringing the team to 18. But that number was quick to dwindle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally just two days later, girls would start dropping out” due to the time commitments,  Nema said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time their first competition came around, their group was down to a solid 13 members, just one member more than the minimum required to compete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That year, UCSB Taara competed in back-to-back competitions for three straight weekends. After the first competition, one teammate dropped out on the drive back to UCSB. Now, they were down to 12, and the team had to rearrange dance formations for the next two weekends of competition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders said that competition season was grueling for the team. Between balancing school schedules with dance practice, the four struggled to keep the team motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone’s grades are falling, no one is sleeping, everyone’s sick, you’re just practicing in parking lots,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taara didn’t have its own designated space to practice on campus, so the captains had to get creative in finding a space to dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would squeeze ourselves into tiny rooms,” Shah said. “We snuck into the theater building. We snuck into [the Humanities and Social Sciences Building]. We snuck into Rob Gym. We snuck into so many [buildings], just so that we could have some floor to dance on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the next weekend’s competition, Taara placed eighth –– last place. The girls used the week between that competition and their next to rearrange parts of their performance with feedback from the judges. At the last competition that season –– Jhoomti Shaam –– Taara placed third. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Winning that, not only was it just amazing because it was our dream competition, but I think it finally showed the team that everything we did was for a reason,” Shah said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team knew at that moment, claiming their trophy, that the tireless hours of practice, sleepless nights and long drives to competitions had paid off. For a team that wasn’t expecting to place at all, taking home third place was more than a victory — it was proof that Taara lived up to its name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a new generation of Taara prepares to take the reign, Nema, Shah, Chandra and Walia agree that Gen One created a precedent –– and a bond –– that will live on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gen One, especially, everyone just grew so close and over everything, it was just a family. I think even leaving it, I know that everyone’s still going to be a team forever, as cheesy as it sounds,” Walia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was no accident that Taara Gen One became a family since it was one of the group’s first goals when they set out to create Taara. They wanted to compete and impress, but mostly, they wanted to dance with people they loved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were 12 small girls, but we were the loudest girls in every room and we were just having the best time. And I think that like, like positive energy really just attracted others to us,” Shah said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taara isn’t just a dance team. We’re also people, we’re good people. We want people to know that we’re friendly people and that is part of why we dance. It makes us happy. We want to share that happiness.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The switch to remote learning forced students to quickly decide whether to stay in Santa Barbara or go to their home countries, a hardship that domestic students did not have to navigate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-19/majority-of-fall-quarter-classes-to-be-held-remotely-tuition-and-student-fees-will-not-change/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB recently unveiled its plan for hybrid instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Fall Quarter 2020, some uncertainty still looms for international students, whose options for the upcoming quarter make the decision between home and UCSB more complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email outlining fall quarter protocols, Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced that all first-year international students will have the option to continue with remote curriculum “sufficient for full-time status,” and that “any student who wishes to continue with a full remote offering may do so without being present on or near campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many international students are unsure whether they can get visas renewed to re-enter the U.S., or if coming to the U.S. is the safest option, according to Hak Zheng, a second-year physics major in the College of Creative Studies, currently back home in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought a one-way ticket because I’m so uncertain about when I can come back,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m actually not sure if I wanted to come back right now if I’m able to. They might not be allowing any non-citizen people to come in [to the U.S.].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng said it was “obvious” for him to go back to Japan instead of “being by myself in I.V.” He tentatively plans to come back to the U.S. for fall quarter, even if his classes are all online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If fall quarter is still online but the U.S. lets me come back inside, I might consider coming back, just because I do feel like my productivity is low here, so I might decide that I’ve had enough time with my family, now I’m gonna go back to my school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students across the country, while disconnected from campus and tuning in to lectures over Zoom, have shifted to a “new normal” over the past few months. This adjustment is even greater for international students, who are trying to keep up with classes in a different time zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students who have chosen to move back home have had to, in some cases, attend lectures and take exams in the middle of the night or early morning. While some professors chose to hold asynchronous classes over the past quarter — which international students could attend to on their own time — there was limited flexibility when it came to exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng had Zoom lectures at 5 a.m. twice a week for one class and had to take the midterm and final exams at 3 a.m. for another class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students who stayed in the U.S. have their normal time and normal schedule, but we have to do this weird scheduling thing, so the score is not a good reflection of where we are. I don’t know if any professors are going to take that into consideration at all, but that’s just something I’m a little concerned about,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we as human beings need that strict sleep schedule to operate well. I feel like I’m less energetic than usual. But I’m seeing it as something that I just have to deal with for this quarter, hopefully only this quarter, but who knows.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time zone difference between California and home proved to be a major factor in some international students’ decision to remain in the U.S. To avoid the time difference, Aimee Wang — a third-year sociology major from China — decided to stay at a friend’s house in Rancho Cucamonga this quarter after moving out of her sorority house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang ran a successful Associated Students Senate campaign for a College of Letters and Science seat, becoming the first international student elected as senator.  But the demands of the job, from running for her seat to beginning her duties at the end of the quarter, meant moving back to China would have been a “huge hassle,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My friends that I’ve spoken with said they’re not going back to China over the summer because, right now, when we go back, we have to quarantine ourselves,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So it’s kind of a very long process to go back, then spend almost a month [quarantining] by yourself. That may be half of a normal summer break, just to come back to the U.S. and you’d probably have to quarantine yourself again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another obstacle for students moving back to China in particular is that they have to use a virtual private network (VPN) for internet access, which Wang said can be very slow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international students in China, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students cannot access Google </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or any affiliated websites like Google Docs due to restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have two other CCS physics students who I’m pretty close with, they’re both from China and they did both decided to stay [in the U.S.], and the main reason for them was that they had to deal with the firewall and probably more restrictions in China,” Zheng said, adding that it was a “50-50” split between friends of his who decided to stay in California and who decided to leave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng also said there’s been a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school and his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel disconnected from my friends, most of my friends are in the United States, so I mean, they call and they would do homework together, so sometimes they’ll be calling while I’m sleeping, so I do notice that I connect with them a lot less than when I’m back in school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a huge difference between trying to connect with a person through a video call than hanging out in person.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main uncertainty that lies ahead for Wang is fall quarter’s hybrid scenario. She said she’ll be staying in I.V. regardless of whether courses are conducted remotely or not because she wants to experience her senior year there. But she added that a concern for many international students is paying international tuition while missing out on in-person educational benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For out-of-state and international students, we pay a lot more for tuition. With the whole online situation, all these changes are already unfair for all the students, but I think it’s even more unfair for international students and out-of-states.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he doesn’t know exactly when he’ll be back in the U.S. But of all the challenges he’s faced this quarter, he said the most difficult and ongoing challenge is the uncertainty that lies ahead for his education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not saying I’m worried about living or anything like that, but mostly learning. Really what most of us are worried about is being able to come back to the U.S. in the fall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-62994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Legal Resource Center is located at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Legal Resource Center (LRC) currently has two lawyers contracted as student legal services advisors; the positions provide confidential, privileged legal counseling for students. The student legal services advisor job description, meant to convert the contracted lawyers into employees, was changed from “inform and advise” to “educate and inform,” according to the amended job description, which the Nexus obtained from Sabina Menzhausen, the incoming student unit director for the LRC and a fifth-year biopsychology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that the LRC — located at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista — will no longer offer its protected counseling service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen and last year’s student unit director, Riley Traut, launched a campaign to reverse the university’s changes to the job description and published a Change.org </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nancy-g-hamill-protect-ucsb-student-access-to-privileged-legal-counseling-services-from-the-lrc?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23075573_en-US%3A1&amp;recruiter=724949681&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on June 25 calling for the university to walk back the changes to the job description. As of June 28, the petition has collected 1,762 signatures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offered Robin Unander, the current Associated Students (A.S.) LRC student legal services advisor, the position under the new job description. The other attorney working for the LRC, Ron Perry, said he did not know enough about the negotiations between Unander and UCSB to appropriately comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander’s contract was supposed to expire on June 30, but UCSB extended it to July 10 in order to allow for more time to negotiate the job description</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB does not reverse the contract’s description of the job, UCSB students will be without privileged, confidential counseling at the LRC, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new changes to the job description, students may ask general legal questions, such as how much time a landlord has to return a security deposit, but students cannot obtain legal counsel or case-specific legal advice from the LRC employee. The student legal services advisor must refer them to someone else, possibly a lawyer retained as a vendor by the university, according to Unander.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that the “legal guidance resources” will continue at the LRC, and that the current concerns over LRC services are based on a “false rumor,” but she declined to elaborate further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada’s comments are “confusing” according to Unander, who said that Estrada’s response does not make sense given the job description in the student legal services advisor contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The changes to the job description] give the university, as well as university police, etc., access to these kinds of cases students come in with and that abolishes the integrity of what the LRC stands for,” Menzhausen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This could castrate that service by eliminating [students’] ability to walk in there and consult on their legal issues without fear of being exposed,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nancy Hamill, UCSB chief campus counsel, did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change in the student legal services advisor job description also means that the advisor will become a mandated reporter, an employee who is legally required to report sexual misconduct allegations, and could be compelled to disclose information a student told them to the authorities, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d also have to report if somebody came to me as a sexual assault survivor and they wanted to know their options and their rights, but they weren’t sure if they wanted to proceed legally or make claims. I would now have to report them,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new job description violates the ballot measure which students voted on in 2001 to provide “free legal education and consultation” as a part of the LRC’s mission, according to Menzhausen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menzhausen said that the A.S. executive office told her that confidential counseling would remain in place but has not responded to her requests for clarification. However, Menzhausen noted that higher offices, such as the campus counsel, are more responsible for the change in job description than the A.S. executive office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email between Melinda Crawford, a UCSB human resources official, and Unander, Crawford said that the amended job description means that Unander “will not be practicing law in this role,” and that Unander is “not permitted to form an attorney-client relationship with anyone.” This email was provided to the Nexus by Unander’s lawyer, Erin Parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job description was amended in mid-June, when Unander asked for employment benefits such as retirement credits, and that the university pay for her mandatory continuing legal education and annual state bar fees during the contract’s negotiations, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks alleges that UCSB made changes to the job description offered to Unander as a retaliatory act after Unander requested employee benefits. Parks said that UCSB misclassified Unander as an independent contractor and that Unander’s responsibilities under her current job description fall under the legal definition of an employee, thus making her eligible for employee benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a person makes a claim that there’s potential violations of law, and immediately something happens like this, that smacks of retaliation,” Parks said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When an individual says, ‘You’ve been breaking the law, you’ve been violating the law and it’s damaged me,’ and the employer then does something to adversely affect their continuing relationship like, ‘We’re no longer going to let you practice law,’ that’s huge, that’s retaliation,” Parks continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada did not respond to a request for comment regarding these allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks requested that UCSB allow Unander to continue working beyond the June 30 expiration date of her current contract, which allows her to offer privileged counseling at the LRC.  The LRC hopes the extension will allow for more time to negotiate the job description while maintaining the current level of legal service to students, according to Unander, who added that UCSB has not yet responded to that request.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If they do not agree to maintain status quo then on July 1 LRC will not be able to function,” she said in a text message to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander has worked with the LRC as an independent contractor since 2003, and since she first joined, Unander said the LRC has provided counsel to at least 16,000 students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander noted that, due to working on behalf of the LRC for over 16 years, she has no private practice to fall back on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the amended job description, Unander would be classified as an official employee of UCSB, rather than an independent contractor, but because she will not practice law in the position, she would not receive the benefits associated with being a practicing attorney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers of lawyers normally reimburse their bar fees, and Unander’s legal counterparts at UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley — who are all employees of the university — have their bar fees reimbursed, according to Parks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that the updated position does not require that the employee holding it have a law license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that the new rules would present a dilemma for whoever fills the position, since in order to know whether or not they can simply give general legal information or recommend consultation with a lawyer, they need to know what legal problem a student has, which would not be privileged if disclosed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a normal school year, the LRC serves 1,000 to 1,300 students, primarily dealing with issues relating to crime, according to Unander. Students also come to the LRC for housing issues and conflicts between students and their landlords, according to Menzhausen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LRC also helps students with more serious legal issues. Erick Velazquez Andrade, a fourth-year microbiology major, said he uses the confidential legal counseling services at the LRC to navigate the complex legal web of immigration law.
