A spokesperson for the UC Office of the President said in an email that Napolitano will consider the recommendations “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as we continue to work with our campuses and community members to find ways to ensure public safety and best serve the entire University community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the letter to Napolitano, Kum-Kum Bhavnani, chair of the council, said the recommendations “represent our solidarity with the current protests against racialized police violence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University must respond to this watershed historical moment by reassessing the role and presence of police on campuses,” Bhavnani said in the letter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Academic Council centered the recommendations on statements they received from students and faculty across the UC System about anti-Black police violence. While the recommendations expand on work done by the Academic Senate’s Public Safety Task Force and the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing, they also criticize the groups’ recent reports as “narrow-bore and technocratic reforms that have failed to address the underlying roots of racialized policing.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendations echo </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/polling-defund-the-police.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calls around the country for communities to defund their police</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> departments and redirect the funding to community services, especially those that benefit Black communities and communities of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Academic Council recommended that the UC: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“substantially” defund campus police departments and move the funding toward efforts to develop “alternative modes of campus safety that minimize and/or abolish the reliance on policing and other criminalizing responses” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in mental and physical health services, especially for Black students and other marginalized students “who have been historically targeted by police violence” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove firearms from campus police’s standard equipment </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminate partnerships with police agencies outside of the UC and restrict access of non-UC police to campus property </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement the recommendations over three years through campus and UC-wide groups which “prioritize the participation of those who have traditionally experienced violence and mistreatment at the hands of police” </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bhavnani said the recommendations “offer a guide for rethinking the role of police on UC campuses” and could spark needed conversations between university officials. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano will step down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from her position as president on Aug. 1.

Recreation &amp; Park District building, and was a guest speaker at various UC Santa Barbara classes — was remembered as “the type of person to respect all people, regardless of who they were,” said Marcelino Sepulveda, a friend of Bean’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He touched many generations of people, and that is represented here today. Today is an opportunity for the greater community to honor Michael for who he was and what he gave us,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees spoke of Bean’s talent for bringing together generations; UCSB students and permanent Isla Vista residents alike touted his dedication to the community around him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had an uncanny ability to see past age and see the person instead, which made people of all ages enjoy his company and want to spend more time with him,” one tearful community member explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean’s commitment to the environment was “unparalleled,” they added. Bean often biked through the streets of I.V. collecting trash and was a strong proponent for a community forest to feed food-insecure community members, the community member said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean was also an active member of the spiritual group Diamond Heart, as several mentioned at the memorial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our group sessions, we would share personal information that was often very difficult to say. Michael would always be there with a kind word, to listen and in turn share his personal stories,” according to one speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to members of Bean’s various community groups, UCSB students also found inspiration in Bean’s dedication to an environmental community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would often read together,” Ash Vincent, a UCSB environmental studies and feminist studies major, said. “He was always interested in what me or any other people were reading, and I thought sharing that shows how he was always interested and always learning new ways he could be useful to the community. I think he was underappreciated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many, including Vincent, left memorial attendees with concrete ways to honor Bean’s legacy. In addition to a petition to dedicate the Free Box to Bean, Vincent encouraged attendees to email him for a copy of an Ecovista source book that Bean wrote before his death.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student — Bean’s neighbor and an environmental studies major, who remained unnamed — acknowledged his uncommon relationship with Bean, who he met in UCSB Professor John Foran’s sociology class Earth in Crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had a very special connection to this place, and I got to see him try and better himself and our community… seeing him biking around and coming home to him feeding the scrub jays in our yard was a really special moment for me, and I’ve been doing my best to feed them for him,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sepulveda, who helped organize the celebration of life, asked attendees to take wildflower seeds and spread them around I.V. following the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We invite you to take these and disperse them, so that his spirit may grow and blossom amongst the flowers here,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Before that, the Matadors had lost five of their last six conference games being swept by UC Irvine and dropping two of three to last-place Long Beach State.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the other side, UCSB picked up a big series win against UCR at home last weekend but failed to pull off a sweep which would have put them in a much better place heading down the stretch. The Gauchos can correct that with a sweep, or at the very least, a series win over CSUN.</p>\n<p>Currently in fourth place, Santa Barbara has 12 games remaining against conference opponents, nine of which will be against teams currently ranked lower than them in the standings, including Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Needing wins, UCSB must rely on some of its key components in order to get the job done this weekend against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Having an unusually down year, sophomore infielder Armani Smith has struggled at the plate. The sophomore is barely batting above .200 on the season. However, in the last five games, Smith has gone 6-16 (.375) at the plate along with eight RBIs. He also hit a three-run big fly in Tuesday’s win against CSUB, his fifth homer of the season.</p>\n<p>If Smith’s big bat is back in action in the lineup, then UCSB truly has a solid starting nine. Sophomore centerfielder Tommy Jew has also been a great bat in the Santa Barbara lineup, currently slashing .294/.382/.451 on the season.</p>\n<p>Last week, Jew received Big West Conference Field Player of the Week after leading the Gauchos to a series win over UC Riverside last weekend. The sophomore went 9-15 (.600) with seven RBIs, scoring six runs while also totaling four extra-base hits including his third home run of the season.</p>\n<p>One thing UCSB will need to be cognizant of, however, is their pitching, as it allowed 24 runs against UCR and another five against CSUB. Sophomore Chris Lincoln (2.19 ERA, 2-2) and senior Stevie Ledesma (2.55 ERA, 5-2) have the second and fourth-best ERA marks in the conference respectively.</p>\n<p>As a team, the pitching staff has a combined 4.10 ERA, and they will have their work cut out for them facing CSUN with their team batting average of .281, the third-best mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Matadors also have the third best on-base percentage (.364) and even the best slugging percentage (.459) in the conference. A big part of that is because the Matadors have arguably the best long-ball hitter in the Big West in senior Albee Weiss.</p>\n<p>The outfielder and catcher currently has 15 home runs on the season, a mark that is not only far and away the best mark in the conference but also sits at eighth nationally. Weiss also has 48 RBIs, the top mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>CSUN also has the conference’s most efficient hitter as redshirt junior utility Trevor Casanova currently boasts a .380 batting average. Casanova also has 27 RBIs on the year. As a team, Cal State Northridge has three athletes batting above .300 on the year.</p>\n<p>While the whole series will be intriguing, seeing how UCSB pitchers adjust to facing a strong offensive team will be a real treat. To be fair, however, CSUN has batted .257 in conference play, a mark that has them sitting seventh in the conference, so something will have to give.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, this series is important because they have another chance to really step on the throat of a team that is a bit weaker than the rest in this conference. With CSUF sitting with a 9-3 Big West mark, Santa Barbara cannot afford to take many more losses in this conference season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge for a three-game set beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 4, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 3rd, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
