The talk was sponsored by the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at UCSB, and was free to the public. Barnes has written various books on the economy, including <em>Who Owns the Sky, Capitalism 3.0</em> and <em>With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough.</em></p>\n<p>Barnes said he believes in fixing capitalism rather than destroying it and that solutions to reforming capitalism boil involve addressing capitalism’s two “tragic” flaws.  </p>\n<p>“The relentless destruction of nature and the equally relentless widening of inequality,” Barnes said. “These flaws are coded into the system. If we want to change them we have to change the system itself, and it’s not enough to fiddle at the edges.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnes, reforming capitalism is an urgent affair that must be addressed on a systematic level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have any time left to fiddle at the edges,” Barnes said. “We have to get to the fundamental systematic roots of these flaws and fix them.”</p>\n<p>Barnes also said capitalism’s flaws can be addressed by arguing against the idea that “the commons,” or community owned resources, are inherently self-destructive. This idea was originally proposed by late UCSB human ecology professor Garrett Hardin, according to Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The commons is not the perpetrator of tragedy but rather the victim and capitalism’s tragic flaws are the actual perpetrators, and that the commons, or what I now prefer to call common wealth, is actually a key part of the solution to the flaws of capitalism,” Barnes said.  </p>\n<p>According to Barnes, in order to fix the “deepest flaws of capitalism,” individuals need to “reclaim the commons,” or common wealth, by organizing and managing the commons on the basis of common ownership, common trustee ship and common benefit. Barnes also said he encouraged audience members to prepare for “the next crisis” by sharing his ideas regarding the commonwealth in writing and online. </p>\n<p>“Start saying things like, ‘The air belongs to all of us,’ or ‘Our money belongs to all of us. Our monetary system belongs to all of us. And they are taking it from us and we have a right to take it back.’” Barnes said. “Start naming common wealth and claiming it. If we do that I do believe that after the next crisis, we can fix the tragic flaws of capitalism.”<br>\n <br>\nEvent organizer and philosophy professor Gregory Jarrett said Barnes’ talk relates to one of his classes on environmental ethics. </p>\n<p>“This is relevant to my class on environmental ethics, but also as you will hear it is part of our mission to bring in other classes,” Jarrett said.  “They are also very excited, they are also talking about the same kind of things in different compartments, and this is our opportunity to get things together.”</p>\n<p>Students in Jarrett’s Environmental Ethics class, professor Robert Wilkinson’s Sustainable Communities, professor Philip McCarty’s Global Economic Development and his Global Studies 1 class were attendance at the lecture.    </p>\n<p>Jarrett said the event aims to bring together students with different majors to listen and talk with Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The goal is to get the students from different disciplines together in the same room not only hear him talk,” Jarrett said.  “But there will be a 30 minute Q and A so they get an opportunity to interact with a speaker like this.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year religious studies and physical geography double major Harlowe Wang said she enjoyed listening to Barnes’ ideas, but also does not see how they could be applied to the real world.</p>\n<p> “I think he was extending human stakeholders that are alive now too far to future generations and to non-human stakeholders,” Wang said.  “I thought his idea was amazing and I think it was very interesting and thought provoking [but] I wished he had spoken more to the actual feasibility and politics of it, because what I’ve taken away from is that its a really great idea … but I still don’t see how it would been implemented.”</p>\n<p>Following the lecture and question and answer segment, there was a book signing of Barnes’ With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough, which was available for purchase at the talk. </p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Day of Education and Activism event aimed to bring attention to the UC’s failure to submit proper expenditure reports under the Assembly Bill No. 94 (AB 94) signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in July 2013. </p>\n<p>According to Shari Sanders, Ph.D. candidate in comparative literature and the main organizer of Day of Education and Activism, students are unaware of the logistics behind the UC budget and must be educated on budget issues in order to prevent passive acceptance of tuition increases such as the increase to be approved by the UC Regents today. </p>\n<p>“The state of California has systematically been taking away education for decades,” Sanders said. “The last time students successfully opposed tuition increases was in 2009 and it is time to stand up in unity once more. If it were not for those student demonstrations, tuition would have been $15,000 more expensive.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said the UC has failed to fulfill its obligations via AB 94, which states that the UC must give reports breaking down expenditures for undergraduate and graduate student instruction and research. </p>\n<p>“Law AB 94 claims that the UC has to issue an accounting of where the money from the tuition goes and how it was spent,” Sanders said. “However, they recently failed to release this information to court and it has already been six weeks and nothing has been done.”</p>\n<p>Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology Aviva Milner-Brage said that her biggest concern with tuition increase is that low-income families and undocumented students are the ones most affected by the currently steep costs of attending a UC. </p>\n<p>“The undocumented students of low-income families are in tough situations,” Milner-Brage said,<br>\n“Their desire to earn degrees is so meaningful to them, and they have to fight even harder for their rights as students. It is not fair.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said she knew two students in a summer course who could not afford rent or a comfortable room to live in because of tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“In my summer class, out of 18 students, one student lived off a friend’s couch for $500 per month and one student was homeless,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>Milner-Brage said it is essential for Brown to fund the UC because the currently high rates of tuition are negatively affecting undergraduate and graduate students who will continue to face an increasing cost for public education.</p>\n<p>“The proposed five percent increase in tuition will only go higher as the years go by,” Sanders said. “Besides this, tuition has tripled the last fifteen years. Undergraduate and graduate students are affected alike, along with middle class families that do not qualify for financial aid.” </p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Gabriel Castro said although he is a recipient of financial aid, the tuition increases have continued to take a toll on his college career.</p>\n<p>“Grants and financial aid do not suffice,” Castro said. “I come from a low-income family. I’m going into debt with loans and it all places a large burden and pressure on me as a student.”</p>\n<p>According to Castro, many students face the challenge of graduating in debt and acquiring a job after graduation that does not fully pay back mounting student loans.</p>\n<p>“I, along with many of my college peers, am more discouraged to go to school each day knowing that my first job as a graduate will probably not cover everything that I owe,” Castro.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Edward Cruz said tuition increases have required him to have a very tight budget, negatively affecting his social life as well as his diet.</p>\n<p>“Because of my debt in loans … I cannot enjoy my evenings with friends at restaurants, movie theaters or concerts,” Cruz said. “This, more or less, ruins my college experience of going out with friends to nice things. On top of this, I cannot afford to buy groceries that are healthy.”</p>\n<p>According to feminist studies professor Eileen Boris, who spoke about topics at the event such as widespread difficulty to find a stable career, students can benefit from working together with professors in order to lower tuition as professors have prior experience with tuition increase issues and “depend on students to keep their careers afloat.”</p>\n<p>“Our jobs, as professors, would not exist without students,” Boris said. “It’s not only a moral and ethical reason to help students, it’s more about going against overpaid administrators that cause students to suffer financially. I’m also a parent which makes me more sensitive to the issue.”</p>\n<p>The event concluded with a march to Storke Tower, led by the Black Student Union (BSU). According to Sanders, the march served as an example that student protests cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>“I saw it as a wakeup call from apathy,” Sanders said. “It showed the strength of BSU student activists to make a sight that was impossible to ignore.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/locals-protest-uc-wide-tuition-hike/","id":2956,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2955,2954,2953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Build Housing on Storke","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Preparations have begun for construction of San Joaquin Village, the first large-scale student housing project associated with the recently approved Long Ranged Development Plan after the California C...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58571\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58571\" data-attachment-id=\"58571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/sja-courtesy-of-housing-ucsb-edu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=480%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"480,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SJA courtesy of housing.ucsb.edu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?fit=480%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58571 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SJA-courtesy-of-housing.ucsb_.edu_.jpg?resize=480%2C306\" alt=\"An artist’s conception of the planned San Joaquin apartments, next to the existing Santa Catalina Residence Hall, which includes new dining commons.

Designed for upper-division undergraduate students, the apartments will include three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a living room. The complexes will also have study and recreation rooms, a small convenience store and a new dining commons. Additionally, on-site amenities will be provided to residents, including a playing field, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts and access to the existing swimming pool at Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>According to Julie Levangie, Multimedia Communications and Marketing Coordinator, the project will provide new housing for approximately 1,000 students, as well as four new residences for faculty members in the Faculty-in-Residence Program and renovations to the Portola Dining Commons inside Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited that the San Joaquin Apartments and Portola Dining Commons project has been approved by the Coastal Commission,” Levangie said. “This supports the terms of the recently approved Long Range Development Plan and its call for an increase in student housing.”</p>\n<p>Levangie said the project will meet the high standards of sustainability and environmental regulation associated with the university.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services strives to be good stewards of the environment and supporting UCSB on its way to becoming a sustainable community,” Levangie said. “The project has several sustainable design measures including storm water retention basin, energy efficient windows, and energy-star appliances for all kitchens.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher, the efforts to make San Joaquin Village sustainable will also include water and energy efficiency and reduced vehicle use on campus through an additional 24 Express bus line established in cooperation with the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>\n<p>“We will be using reclaimed water extensively, using the most up-to-date lighting technology, and naturally ventilating all of the living spaces,” Fisher said. “The project works to improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation in and around the site including street improvements on Storke and El Colegio Roads.”</p>\n<p>Fisher also said the San Joaquin Village’s building style will center around a theme of modern architecture and landscaping.</p>\n<p>“This will be a project with excellent architecture and a beautiful landscape of courtyards and paseos,” Fisher said. “The buildings are quite modern. This is a very exciting project in terms of its architecture and landscape.”</p>\n<p>According to Levangie, while the new university housing is roughly a mile from campus, she does not believe commuting will be a problem for residents.</p>\n<p>“As far as distance, residents will be a short 10 minute off-street bike ride from the middle of campus or a five minute bus ride to campus,” Levangie said.<br>\nFisher said he hopes the new apartments will encourage students to remain within university housing systems.</p>\n<p>“We believe this housing will provide students with a desirable alternative to apartments in Isla Vista,” Fisher said. “We hope that more students will choose to stay in on-campus housing during all of their years on our campus.”</p>\n<p>Allie Davidson, second-year biology major and residential assistant at Santa Rosa Hall, said the San Joaquin Village will help improve the housing situation for students on campus in light of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“With capacity for 1,000 residents, the San Joaquin apartments will certainly aid with current overcrowding of residence halls,” Davidson said. “I think the installment of these new resident apartments will have a positive impact on the students at UCSB, provided Housing and Residential Services continue their efforts in energy-saving and environmentally efficient machinery, lights and facilities.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58552\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58552\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/ucsb-set-to-build-housing-on-storke/","id":2957,"author":{"id":172,"name":"Teddy Krolczyk"},"related":[2956,2955,2954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Protest Mexican Government’s Connection to Missing Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students gathered in the Arbor yesterday to participate in a protest against the government of Mexico for their alleged participation in the kidnapping of 43 Mexican college students, all of whom are ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students gathered in the Arbor yesterday to participate in a protest against the government of Mexico for their alleged participation in the kidnapping of 43 Mexican college students, all of whom are presumed dead.</p>\n<p>In September, 43 students from a school in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, were allegedly taken by police and handed off to members of a criminal group, Guerreros Unidos. Last week, after authorities disclosed the discovery of potential remains, protests sparked across Mexico and many parts of the United States, with students joining in the movement through organized protest in front of a row of 43 photos that represent each of the missing students.</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said the protest consisted of all day activities aimed at engaging and educating students about the incident in Mexico. </p>\n<p>“Today was a collective; we’re standing in solidarity with other UC campuses, and the entire world,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year anthropology major Stephany Rubio, who was one of many organizers of the demonstration, the issue concerning the student deaths has been worsened by the Mexican government’s control of traditional media in the country. </p>\n<p>“In Mexico, the president owns Televisa, which is the main source of getting any news and they’re quieting the situation down as much as they can,” Rubio said. “For us, <em>ya nos cansamos</em> — we’re tired, we want the state to take action.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said social media in Mexico is not regulated and that on the social media site Twitter the tag #YaMeCanse, which is trending worldwide and means, “Enough, I’m tired,” in Spanish, is directed at the Mexican government.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Spanish and sociology double major Jaime Serrano said he felt the need to participate in the protest because he feels there is not enough attention to the issue on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m out here because I think more needed to be done, here especially,” Serrano said. “With such large Spanish-speaking community, I feel more needed to be done about the injustices that are happening in Mexico.”</p>\n<p>According to fifth-year Latin American and Iberian studies and Spanish double major Gabriela Mora, the demonstration was meant to get more students to ask questions, take interest and possibly speak out against injustices in Mexico.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people haven’t even heard about the event,” Mora said. “We had a really good reaction here. We kind of scared people, but we’re not trying to instill fear.”</p>\n<p>Rubio also said she wants to see attention toward the deaths reach beyond campus and occur in other areas in the country. </p>\n<p>“We’re trying to reach farther than just the UCSB community,” Rubio said. “We want to reach the United States. What goes on over there, directly affects us here. The U.S. even funds the Mexican government. We want to reach internationally.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/","id":2958,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2957,2956,2955],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
