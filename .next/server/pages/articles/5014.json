It was junior defender Sophie Trabucco who opened up the scoreboard at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243779\">7:00</span> mark. However, the Hawks quickly responded with three consecutive goals from Katie McKenty, LJ Edwards, and Lauren Brennan.</p>\n<p>Hartwick once again came out strong in the second quarter and went on another 3-1 run putting them in the lead 6-3 with three minutes left in the half. UCSB executed on consecutive possessions shortening the Hawks lead, but the Hawks found the back of the cage in the last second to take them into half time with a two score lead.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was a constant battle for the Gauchos who tied the score in two occasions, only to have Hartwick reclaim their lead shortly after. With little time left on the clock, Santa Barbara turned to senior center Lauren Martin who scored 21 seconds after the Hawks had gained a two-goal lead, and was followed by junior attacker Brenna Thomas on a power play to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s senior attacker Bryn Hudson scored first in overtime, Brittany Tait would give the Hawks another chance by forcing the game into sudden death. This was the first time Santa Barbara had gone into sudden death so far in the season.</p>\n<p>It was Martin who won the sprint to give UCSB the first possession, in which she capitalized with the winning goal after 21 seconds to finish 15-14.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day proved to be just as challenging for the Gauchos who came out on top after another overtime game against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Carrying on the momentum from the first match, Martin scored back-to-back goals to start the game. The Tigers found the back of the net on three occasions to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore reclaimed the lead at the start of the second period, scoring on her own rebound after her shot had gone off the post the first time.</p>\n<p>The Tigers had a comeback in the second quarter. For the first time in the game they took the lead after a penalty shot taken by Rachel Krieger. Pacific was now on top with a two-goal lead by the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly came back and tied the game within the first minute of the third period with the help of Thomas who set up senior utility Samantha Murphy and Martin on back-to-back possessions.</p>\n<p>The seesaw battle carried on to the last period, in what looked like the Tigers would pull off the win after scoring with only 38 seconds left. But the Gauchos drew an ejection foul and took advantage on their last possession, with Shore scoring the equalizer with 13 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored first in overtime with Shore assisting Martin, followed by freshman defender Kristen Denney to end the first OT period. The tigers tried to fight back, but their goal from Ellen Tiedmann was retaliated by junior utility Miranda Schrader securing the win for the Gauchos, 13-11.</p>\n<p>Martin finished the day with a total of seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against Pacific making it the second game in the season in which she collects that many. Contributing to the day’s success were Hudson, Schrader, and Thomas with four goals of their own.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split the final day of the invitational falling to No. 7 Michigan, the top ranked team in the tournament, in a 14-8 loss and another nail biter win over No. 15 San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines scored the first goal of the game, but were answered by Thomas to put UCSB on the board. Although the Gauchos scored once again, they also allowed two goals sending them into the second quarter behind Michigan 4-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored on three occasions in the second quarter, two of them coming from Murphy, but Michigan put away four unanswered goals to stay on top.</p>\n<p>The 11-5 lead by the Wolverines proved to be too much for the Gauchos despite two goals by sophomore utility Camila Schafer and Kreiser. Michigan sealed the deal with three more goals to end the game with a six-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The final game of the weekend resulted in a 9-8 victory over SDSU.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs got on the board first, but their lead only lasted 12 seconds thanks to a hat trick delivered by Murphy. The Gauchos would then go on a 3-0 run, including two from Murphy. San Diego put away three of its own, but were unable to take the lead ending the first period trailing UCSB 4-3.</p>\n<p>Although the second half of the game fluctuated between a one or two point difference, the Gauchos never let SDSU tie it up.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara went into the final quarter up 8-6, but the Aztecs found the back of the net at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243780\">6:11</span> mark putting them within one point.</p>\n<p>Thomas scored the last goal for the Gauchos, and although Tayla Walsh responded to it, it was not enough to come out on top.</p>\n<p>Defense took care of the remainder of the game not allowing any more goals from the Aztecs and senior goalkeeper MacKenzie Broakaw recording a late-game save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume play on February 13<sup>th</sup> at the Triton Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-02/no-11-ucsb-goes-3-1-at-michigan-invitational/","id":5014,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5013,5012,5011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon","biography":"Not available","articles":[1970,4969,4970,4971,4987,4989,4994,4997,5007,5010,5011,5012,5014,5453,5454,5455,5457,5458,5459,5471,5477],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 13 Gauchos Close Out Winter Invitational at 3-2, Losses to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal, the UCSB women's water polo team finished its Winter Invitational with a 3-2 record.

With only 27 seconds left in the period, sophomore driver Carla Carraga tied the score for the Golden Bears with a short-range shot.</p>\n<p>Cal then went on a 2-0 run to take the lead for the first time in the game. After a timeout called by the Gauchos, junior utility Miranda Schrader put it in the back of the net to tie the game up 2-2 before going into half time.</p>\n<p>In the third period, the Gauchos claimed the lead once again off of a foul transition. The game went back and forth as Cal evened the score at the 4:10 mark only to be answered by Martin’s backhand scoring play, putting the Gauchos in the lead 5-4.</p>\n<p>As the battle continued, UCSB was able to contain the Bears’ offense until the last seven seconds of regulation when Carrega tied the match sending it into overtime.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went on scoreless, and it wasn’t until the 1:31 mark of the second period when the Bears found the winning goal by junior driver Genevieive Weed.</p>\n<p>On the second day of the tournament, the Gauchos played Cal Baptist in the afternoon with junior utility Taylor Shore, senior attacker Bryn Hudson and Martin each scoring two goals each.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense remained strong as it held off the Lancers, keeping them scoreless until midway of the second quarter, which by that point the Gauchos were already up 5-0. At the 4:42 mark Cal Baptist scored its first goal of the match, but was quickly answered by freshman utility Sarah Kreiser to maintain the five-point lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Lancers scored two more in the fourth quarter to shorten the lead 9-4, the Gauchos put one more away to end the game in a 10-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Later that night, UCSB faced its toughest competitor of the tournament, the UCLA Bruins. Despite having scored first, the Gauchos were not able to maintain its lead as the Bruins went on a 5-0 unanswered scoring streak.</p>\n<p>“I think we are countering well and we got good patience, something to improve on is reacting quicker on defense,” Kay said postgame.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with UCLA on top 3-1, which carried its momentum into the second quarter scoring within the period’s first minute. Although the Gauchos had the opportunity to strike back, they did not capitalize on the two back-to-back offensive fouls committed by the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Following the second period, the Gauchos managed to score two more goals, reducing their deficit to 6-3 to which the Bruins reacted quickly.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s efforts to catch up, UCLA did not give up the three-point lead ending the game 8-5 with a victory for the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“It is always fun to play against UCLA for me, those were my glory days and it is always a blast,” Kay said after facing her alma mater.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos wrapped up its Winter Invitational with a sweep over No.21 UCSD and No.20 Wagner.</p>\n<p>The Tritons were looking to finish the weekend with a perfect record in the first game of the day. However, after an intense seesaw game the Gauchos spoiled it for UCSD finishing on top 10-9.</p>\n<p>Both teams came out slow in the first quarter, and couldn’t seem to find the net. The Tritons opened up the board with a goal at the 5:26 mark to which the Gauchos counter attacked and scored a point to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Things got going in the second quarter as both teams scored a couple of goals, finishing the first half of the game with UCSB leading 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting fourth quarter in which the Tritons would fight back and tie the game on three separate occasions. Two of these were penalty shots from Alexia Wieseler.</p>\n<p>Unable to surpass a one-point lead, UCSB was aware of the importance to keep possession of the ball for as long as it could. After Schrader tallied a goal, the Gauchos held on to the ball and let the clock run to end the game with a close win over the Tritons.</p>\n<p>Despite a long weekend, the Gauchos remained focused and strong in their last game against Wagner. Great work on both ends of the pool helped defeat the Seahawks, 10-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not lose any time and put away two scores within the first minute and a half. The biggest lead came in the third quarter as the Gauchos held Wagner down 7-2.<br>\nAfter that, the Gauchos did not allow the Seahawks to get closer than three points.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a season-high of 15 saves during the game while Shore ended the day as UCSB’s leading scorer with five goals. Martin had six ejections total and three steals to contribute to the Gauchos’ total of 15.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with the team’s performance,” Kay said. “I really think we are playing with the best, but we still have a lot of areas to polish up, like technical skills and simple awareness.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their season on the road, as they head to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invitational this upcoming weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Alberta native kicked off her collegiate career with an outstanding performance at the LouStrong Invitational, scoring 19 goals in her first four games.</p>\n<p>Christmas helped the Canadian U-19 team to third place at the 2014 Pan Am games and was the top scorer at the Worlds Hungary Tournament.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will play against No. 7 Michigan in the afternoon and No.15 SDSU at night.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines finished with an overall 3-2 record in their appearance at the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Michigan swept the weekly awards with senior attacker Ali Thomason who received CWPA Player of the Week after tallying 19 goals, two assists, four steals and 17-of-19 sprints won. The Defensive Player of the Week went to senior goalkeeper Julia Campbell, who had 35 saves, and the Rookie of the Week was awarded to freshman defender Kim Johnson who managed to put 12 away.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will wrap up the weekend with No.15 SDSU, who will play its first games of the year in this tournament.</p>\n<p>The reigning back-to-back Golden Coast Conference regular season champions have four returning All-American players, including Caroline Israels.</p>\n<p>The junior utility was named GCC Co-Player of the Year and earned ACWPC Honorable Mention All-American last season. With 61 goals, 53 steals and 18 assists, she finished second in the GCC for goals scored.</p>\n<p>Having played against top-notch competition last weekend gives the Gauchos a bit of an advantage for the upcoming games, especially since two of them have yet to see action this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hartwick at 3:40 p.m. followed by Pacific at 5:50 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/","id":5012,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5011,5010,5009],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Seniors Lead No. 9 UCSB to Three-Set Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos pull off an easy victory over the Tritons","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62309\" style=\"width: 5484px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1922223981\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62321\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62309\" data-attachment-id=\"62309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/hayden-boehle-passes-a-swing-from-the-outside-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M-VBall_4.8_Eric_Swenson_003-web.jpg?fit=5474%2C3653&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5474,3653\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Hayden Boehle passes a swing from the outside.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It was the seniors who led the way on their special night on Friday as the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team defeated UCSD 3-0 in redshirt seniors Kevin Donohue, Weston Nielson, Jake Staahl and Vaun Lennon’s last matches in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p>It was an easy victory for the Gauchos as they downed the Tritons 25-23, 25-17, 25-20. The win brings UCSB’s record to 15-9, 11-9 in MPSF play with two matches remaining in the schedule. UCSD continued its losing streak and its record is now at 2-24, 0-20 in MPSF matches.</p>\n<p>“We could have played a lot better. They played one of their best matches of the year,” junior setter Jonah Seif said. “They easily could have taken the first game and it showed that you really can’t take any match for granted. We were happy to just get the win and move on.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the match, the four seniors on the roster were honored, with Donohue, Nielson and Staahl playing their last match at Rob Gym, and Lennon sitting on the bench after an unfortunate injury that led to ACL surgery earlier in the year. It ended up that the three seniors on the court that led the team to victory with their play Friday night.</p>\n<p>“All of the seniors are vital to the team,” Delson said. “They bring a sense of calm to our team and they lead us younger guys both on and off the court. There isn’t a situation they have been in and those guys have been huge to our team this year.”</p>\n<p>The first game was one that San Diego competed in throughout, and up 17-14, it looked as if they might take the game. Santa Barbara benefitted from a collection of errors by UCSD’s hitters and the Gauchos were able to tie the match at 19-19 on an attacking error from redshirt freshman opposite Tanner Syftestad. From this point on, the Gauchos never went down in the game, and they took the first set 25-23 on a service error by sophomore outside hitter Ian Colbert.</p>\n<p>“We played down to their level in the first set,” redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “We had a huddle at the end of the set and talked about forgetting that it was senior night and that we were playing a team that hadn’t won in MPSF all season. We just had to wake up and we did a bit after that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB took the lead at 2-1 in the second game and they didn’t let it up, going on a four-point run to lead 4-1 and running away with the game after that. Nielson was the star of the set with four kills and four digs, and Seif added seven digs on his way to 16 total in the match to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The third game followed the same storyline as UCSB took the lead early and the team never relinquished it. Donohue had six kills in the set, ending the match with 12 kills to lead the team, and Seif added three service aces to bring his total to four in the match. Donohue ended the match with two kills as he and his teammates hope to go on the road and bring home a trophy.</p>\n<p>“Donny played a great match. He was the go-to guy in game one” Seif said. “He, like all of the seniors, definitely really wanted the win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have two matches left this week before MPSF playoffs, taking on No. 3 Pepperdine on Wednesday and No. 15 Stanford on Saturday. They will be hoping that the momentum from the win against San Diego will propel them on a run deep into the playoffs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62321\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62321\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/seniors-lead-no-9-ucsb-to-three-set-sweep/","id":5013,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5012,5011,5010],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
