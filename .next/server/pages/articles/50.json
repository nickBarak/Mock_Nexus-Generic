The two teams were tied at 1-1 until the fifth inning, in which 49ers’ sophomore infielder LT Torres was called safe at third base on a close play, allowing teammate Alley Perkins to cross the plate and put the score at 2-1.</p>\n<p>Refusing to feel defeated, the Gauchos answered back in the sixth when senior infielder Arianna Palomares slugged a game-winning two-run homer into right field just beyond the fence, putting the score at 3-2. This was Palomares’ third home run of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I was really upset that I didn’t get the bunt down twice,” Palomares said. “I just knew that I needed to move my runner, and the home run just came out of it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to hold the lead into the seventh, collecting three easy outs for the win. Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well and threw a complete game in collecting her eighth win of the season. Facing 31 batters, Ludlow allowed only two earned runs and nine hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as the wind at Campus Diamond picked up, so did the 49ers in their 14-6 win in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader.</p>\n<p>The start of the second game looked promising for the Gauchos when in the first inning senior catcher Samantha Stark hit a double to left field, bringing home junior infielder Kristen Clark and sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston, giving UCSB a 2-0 cushion.</p>\n<p>Stark was one of the biggest playmakers on the day for the Gauchos, finishing 3-4 with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of fire, we were just really excited and we had a lot of fight within us,” Stark said.</p>\n<p>The second inning would expose a weak Gauchos’ defense, as UCSB suffered from major fielding errors. With just one more out needed to get the Gauchos out of the second inning, a UCSB error on a deep ball into left field resulted in the 49ers’ first run of the game.</p>\n<p>However, this was not the only unearned run Long Beach would score, as the 49ers tallied four more unearned runs in the second, putting the score at 5-2 until UCSB finally recorded the third out. Long Beach State’s first ten runs were all unearned.</p>\n<p>There was a hopeful moment in the third for the Gauchos when they cut the 49er lead from three runs to one thanks to a clutch double to center field from junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos, scoring Menor and junior infielder Emily Brucelas on the play.</p>\n<p>This was the closest the Gauchos would get, as the 49ers collected another five runs in the fourth, and another four in the seventh. Cavazos also had a big day for the Gauchos, going 2-3 at the plate and finishing with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s final game was a blow to the Gauchos confidence, as they were shutout by the 49ers, unable to put a single run on the board. Long Beach however had a different day as they piled nine runs on UCSB in just five innings.</p>\n<p>The young freshman pitcher Ashley Wright saw some action in the last 1.2 innings of the game, providing much needed relief. She allowed only one hit and struck out one.</p>\n<p>Ludlow, however, took the loss after tossing 2.2 innings and giving up five earned runs off of 6 hits. She was unable to strike out any 49ers. Gulvin also pitched .2 innings in the game, but was quickly relieved by Wright when she gave up four runs.</p>\n<p>UCSB had only two hits in the game, one each by Junior infielder Emily Brucelas and Arianna Palomares with Brucelas’ hit coming on a double in the third inning. Long Beach starting pitcher Christina Clermont threw a complete game, striking out 9 Gauchos and walking none in picking up her 16th win of the season.</p>\n<p>“We have to just keep fighting. With our conference, anything can happen so we have to keep fighting and doing what we have to do,” said Stark.</p>\n<p>Following the weekend, the Gauchos now sit at 22-25 overall and 5-7 in Big West play. The 49ers improved to 26-17 overall, 6-6 in conference play. Long Beach is currently ranked third in the Big West standings while UCSB is close behind ranked fourth. UCSB will prepare to face Hawaii at home next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2019 free-agent class, largely considered to be one of the most prolific crops of players ever, has more or less come to an end about a week and a half after starting on June 30.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first day of free agency alone, almost three billion dollars of money were inked in contracts across the league as a whole. Some of these were expected contracts, like the 76ers giving its budding superstar Ben Simmons a max extension and the Warriors giving Klay Thompson a max contract as well. Other deals were a lot less expected, like Jimmy Butler signing with the Heat and Al Horford signing a four-year 110 million dollar deal from the 76ers as he approaches age 34.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we get to the absolute shocker, the deal so unexpected some consider it to be downright blasphemous: Kawhi Leonard signing the max with the Clippers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fairness, Kawhi Leonard signing with the Clippers is not the issue here. He is an eligible free agent and can exercise his right to sign with a new team. The issue comes because he recruited a second star, Paul George from the OKC Thunder, to join him in LA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After trying to get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to join him on the Clippers to no avail (both of whom signed with Brooklyn promptly at the start of free agency), Leonard convinced a player who finished third in MVP voting and who just had his career-best year to leave his team while under a three-year contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as the deal ended, everyone called foul.Paul George forced his way out of Indiana, Leonard had his drama with San Antonio two years later, Anthony Davis created a commotion in NOLA to be traded to the Lakers earlier this year, and now Paul George yet again forced his way out of another team in OKC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The increased player movement seen in the last decade has been a controversial topic amongst NBA fans. When I say player movement, I’m not referring to teaming up in free agency; I’m specifically referring to under-contract players who force their team’s hand in an attempt to leave their respective organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fans are pro-player and feel it is well within a player’s right to leave their current team if he does not want to be there any more. Their reasoning is that when teams trade players away it’s considered a business move and when players leave, it should be seen in a similar light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other fans, however, are less in favor of the players, citing that large-market teams are usually the continued benefactors of this movement, relegating the smaller markets to be in the background of the league. New Orleans was an irrelevant team until they landed generational talent, Anthony Davis. But Davis forced his way out of NOLA to the Lakers, who have been a major market since the beginning of basketball itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) has provisions to try to incentivize players to stay loyal to a franchise with large monetary benefits the incumbent teams can present </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> however, in this free agency alone, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard gave up a combined 200 million dollars in financial benefits by moving to their new respective teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s very apparent that for the elite-level players, the financial incentives presented by the CBA are not enough to mitigate their movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So where do we go from here? NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal in trying to explore new incentives and methods to mitigate the current level of player movement. Prominent media members are split on the issue and some have called for radical changes, like having players not be trade eligible for X number of years after signing to prevent them from forcing their way out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halting player movement entirely isn’t ideal either. Player movement adds a necessary intrigue to the league but the current level has shifted the landscape of the NBA too drastically and too often to allow it to continue at this level. Although it is unlikely that any rules to stop the phenomenon will come soon, be on the lookout for some big changes to come in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/","id":47,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[46,45,44],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Manages to Take One Game, Outlasted by CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to avoid being swept with a 6-1 victory in game two on Saturday, the UCSB softball team dropped its other two games in its series at Cal State Northridge.

Ludlow did however register another five strikeouts, putting her at 124 this season and ranking her third in strikeouts in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>While UCSB couldn’t get any runs on the board, it came close on two occasions. Junior outfielders Kristen Clark and Jacqueline Hinojosa each collected singles while facing a two-out count and eventually made it into scoring position. However, both were left stranded on-base unable to score.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s follow up game nearly resulted in a shutout victory for the Gauchos as they stepped up to record a well-earned win of their own, defeating the Matadors 6-1. Fired up to get their first run of the day, the Gauchos scored all six of their runs in the first two innings.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s scoring stretch was ignited by Arianna Palomares once she hit a double to left field, bringing home Clark and senior catcher Samantha Stark. Palomares’ two clutch RBIs on the day has her tied for second on the team in total RBIs with 26, along with sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston.</p>\n<p>The second big hit of the day was delivered by Clark when she stepped up to the plate with the bases loaded. She laced a double to left outfield, scoring freshman infielder Melanie Menor, junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos, and Johnston. Clark had a stellar performance overall, tallying a total of two runs scored and three RBIs in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last game was a 6-2 loss, yet it started off hopeful as the Gauchos were the first to put runs on the board.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer did what she does best, and hit a double to left center, bringing in Menor for the first run of the game. Altmeyer leads the team with 30 RBIs. Altmeyer also brought in a run of her own, scoring on a Cavazos error.</p>\n<p>That was all the offensive action that the Gauchos would see as the Matadors came back to score three runs in the third and another three in the fifth inning.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos registered just three hits in the game, as Matador pitcher Daphne Pofek was outstanding on the mound pitching a complete game and striking out seven in getting her 11th win of the season.</p>\n<p>Gaucho starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow took the loss and is now 7-10 on the year. She gave up six earned runs in 5.1 innings pitched, striking out five and walking two.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a non-conference game on Wednesday, April 20 at home against Cal Berkeley. The Golden Bears are 21-17-1 on the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70061\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-manages-to-take-one-game-outlasted-by-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70061\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-manages-to-take-one-game-outlasted-by-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-manages-to-take-one-game-outlasted-by-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-manages-to-take-one-game-outlasted-by-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-manages-to-take-one-game-outlasted-by-csun/","id":48,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[47,46,45],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Welcome Cal and LBSU to Campus Diamond","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One game behind the .500 mark, the UCSB softball team will attempt to remain within the top of the Big West Conference standings as the Gauchos are schedules to face Cal this Wednesday and Long Beach ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In hopes of staying within the race of the Big West standings, an important week awaits the UCSB softball team.

It’s really just about getting back to playing clean softball,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “We’ve had a lot of different people step up who continue to get clutch performances.”</p>\n<p>The Golden Bears play with a powerful offense which consists of three standout players who together account for most of the team’s success. These players hold the top positions in the batting lineup, and are powerful hitters all around.</p>\n<p>Cal’s sophomore utility player Jazmyn Jackson will be a focus for the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as she holds the team’s highest batting average of .390. Jackson has scored a total of 26 runs this season on 57 total hits. She has also contributed seven doubles and 16 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Another key contributor for the Golden Bears is sophomore infielder Kobie Pettis. Pettis currently possesses a team-leading 26 RBIs this season. She has also slugged two home runs along with recording 10 doubles. Pettis also bats owns a .356 hitting clip and has a total of 15 runs scored this season off 42 hits.</p>\n<p>Despite her freshman status, Cal infielder Lindsay Rood has been a consistent force in the Golden Bears’ batting rotation, leading the team with 34 runs scored this season. She’s also registered a total of 20 RBIS, five doubles, two triples, and three home runs.</p>\n<p>Following two resting days between its contest versus Cal, UCSB will return to the field to face Long Beach State this Saturday.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have strengths in both hitting and pitching, making them an extremely versatile team and a tough opponent. Junior starting pitcher Christina Clermont is sure to see the mound this weekend as she has established her presence with a 14-7 record while tossing a total of 142.2 innings this season while accumulating a 2.11 ERA. Clermont has given up 43 earned runs, and has recorded a solid 144 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Complementing LBSU’s pitching will be its performance at the plate as well. Senior third baseman Darian Tautalafua has dominated Big West play, earning Player of the Week after hitting 4 home runs in Long Beach’s series’ victory last weekend against UC Davis. Tautalafua leads her team in almost every offensive category. She has slugged 12 home runs this season, along with six doubles and one triple. Nonetheless, her abilities at-bat are phenomenal as she bolsters 44 RBIs and has notched an on-base percentage of .421.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Nichole Fry has also made moves this season, and serves as a secret weapon for the 49ers. Although she holds a lower spot in the batting lineup, she has tallied a total of 26 runs scored this season and seven doubles, all while holding just a .250 average.</p>\n<p>In hopes of returning to its playing form in which it began the season with, UCSB will be led by the veteran talent of senior infielder Arianna Palomares. She is currently second on the team in runs scored with 25 and has 26 RBIs this season.</p>\n<p>“We just need to play together. We’ve seen glimpses of the best that we can do, but it’s going to take all of us being on at the same time and really clicking,” said Palomares.</p>\n<p>Freshman second baseman Seirra Altmeyer continues to prove her talents among the lineup as well. Altmeyer leads with 30 RBIs and 12 doubles this season. She also holds an on-base percentage of .383, while contributing 15 runs scored off of 37 hits.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow and freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin will be sure to split the Gauchos upcoming games. Ludlow has provided 130 innings of pitching this season, while giving up 53 earned runs and striking out 127 batters. Gulvin has also provided 95 solid innings while giving up 47 earned runs and striking out 58 batters.<br>\nThe Gauchos will take on the Cal Golden Bears at 2 p.m. this Wednesday, April 20. On Saturday, April 23, UCSB will play Long Beach State at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. The final game of the series will take place on Sunday, April 24 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/ucsb-set-to-welcome-cal-and-lbsu-to-campus-diamond/","id":49,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[48,47,46],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
