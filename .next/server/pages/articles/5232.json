The teams were even at 8.0 blocks overall, and the Gauchos dominated with 33 digs to CSUN’s 24, but in the end they were not able to break the Matadors from their rhythm. The Gauchos fell to the CSUN in a quick four-set match (18-25, 25-21, 23-25, 23-25).</p>\n<p>“I felt they passed really well and it was really tough to get them out of system,” sophomore libero Parker Boehle said. “Their setter also did a really good job and it was tough on our block.”</p>\n<p>CSUN’s sophomore outside hitter Sam Holt led the Matadors offensively, earning a team-high 18 kills. Defensively, junior middle blocker Greg Faulkner and freshman opposite Damani Lenore stopped the Gauchos at the net with five blocks apiece.</p>\n<p>Despite coming out flat as a team, individual players came out strong for UCSB. Junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen led the offense with a team-high 16 kills and junior middle blocker Jake Staahl led the defense with five blocks on the night. After Saturday night’s match the Matadors advance to a record of 10-15 overall (9-13 MPSF).</p>\n<p>Earlier in the week UCSB pulled off a crucial win over Long Beach State in a dramatic five-set finish (16-25, 25-21, 23-25, 25-23, 15-12). This win was especially important for UCSB because while they are still fighting for a playoff position, they now hold the tiebreaker over Long Beach in the contention standings.</p>\n<p>Starting Thursday night’s match off slow, the Gauchos found their rhythm offensively and defensively in the second set. The Gauchos stepped up with 14 kills and six team blocks to tie the set at 19. Multiple players recorded kills in double digits against Long Beach, but it was senior outside hitter Matt Hanley that led the way with a team-high 21 kills.</p>\n<p>In addition to Hanley’s impressive performance, sophomore setter Jonah Seif and senior libero Chad Kingi both had career-high nights. Seif controlled the net and recorded a personal best of 61 assists, and Kingi commanded the middle with an impressive 24 digs.</p>\n<p>“I think we did a really good job preparing for the game against Long Beach, a lot of credit to our coach Rick McLaughlin,” Boehle said. “Kingi and Hanley were really able to execute the game plan, and overall we had a great week in practice.”</p>\n<p>After exchanging sets back and forth, the real determinant happened in the fifth set. With the game tied at nine, a crucial block from Hanley and Staahl and a Long Beach attacking error gave the Gauchos the upper hand. A solo block from Thompson sealed the deal for the Gauchos, and they won the final set by three. Long Beach State moves forward with a record of 16-9 (13-9).</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home this week for their final two matches of the season against Cal Baptist University and BYU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 7, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-5-gauchos-overpower-no-6-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-5-gauchos-overpower-no-6-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-5-gauchos-overpower-no-6-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-5-gauchos-overpower-no-6-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-5-gauchos-overpower-no-6-long-beach-state/","id":5232,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5231,5230,5229],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson","biography":"Not available","articles":[595,5066,5085,5112,5113,5114,5115,5116,5117,5118,5119,5217,5219,5230,5231,5232,5233,5234,5237,5238,5239,5240,5241,5242,5254,5258,5259,5260,5263,5264,5265,5266,5267,5269,5287,5289,5290,5291,5292,5295],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Women’s Water Polo: Team Heads to OC for Pair of Conference Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team heads into their final weekend of the regular season set to face off against two conference rivals on the road: No. 19 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 10...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team heads into their final weekend of the regular season set to face off against two conference rivals on the road: No. 19 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 10 UC Irvine on Sunday.

On offense, senior utility Claire Buchanan has scored in eight straight games (all player stats from the game against Cal Baptist were discarded when UCSB was forced to forfeit) — her longest streak of the season, and has scored 17 goals over that period. Senior guard Kathryn Nelson is on a seven-game streak — her second longest of the season — during which she has found the net 14 times.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing two really tough defensive teams this weekend,” Buchanan said. “It’s going to be really important for the other girls to step up and start scoring. We’ve been working on taking outside shots and focusing on [Irvine’s and Long Beach’s] weak goalies. These are our last games on the road, so they’re really important, especially for the seniors.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Christie Clark is also a force on offense. Her 29 goals this season have brought her career total to 145, just seven away from third place on Santa Barbara’s all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>“My focus is entirely on the season at this point,” Clark said. “If the record comes that’s awesome, but I’d be happier with a Big West win or an NCAA win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense is anchored by sophomore goalie Ruth Milne, whose 11.47 saves per game ranks first in the conference and whose 265 saves this season are just 10 away from tying her own single season school record.</p>\n<p>“[Ruth] gives the offense a lot of confidence,” Wigo said. “Knowing we have a wall in the gates gives us some leeway and allows us to take some risks that we normally wouldn’t take.”</p>\n<p>This will not be the first time this season that UCSB has faced either UC Irvine or Long Beach State. On Jan. 30, the Gauchos suffered a 9-5 defeat at the hands of the Anteaters and dropped a game against the 49ers 5-2 on Feb. 12.. Winning this weekend will not only get the Gauchos some long-sought revenge, but could also secure them the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>Although Long Beach is 0-2 in conference so far and does not pose much of a threat to the Gauchos in terms of seeding, a win against them and then against Irvine — who is 2-0 in conference — would at least guarantee them the No. 2 seed behind Northridge, who is 3-0 in conference after beating the Gauchos last weekend.</p>\n<p>“The higher seed we have the better schedule,” Wigo said. “If we’re top two we get a bye in the first round, and if we’re No. 3 we have to play the No. 6 seed. So ideally we want to be in the top two, but if we can’t get that we’ll take the third seed.”</p>\n<p>Both games are set to start at noon on their respective days. Once Sunday’s game against Irvine is over, the Gauchos will be idle until April 29<sup> </sup>— the first day of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/","id":5229,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5228,5227,5226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.18.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.Stanford-14-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.18.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.Stanford-14-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB fell to the top team in the MPSF in BYU this weekend in five sets.

The Gauchos started out the match trailing the Cougars 1-0. Multiple attack errors kept the Gauchos from holding on to the lead for more than a few points.</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start, the Gauchos were able to adjust to BYU’s vocal fans and pull ahead in the second and third set. Senior opposite Evan Licht and junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen led the dominant offensive push with 15 kills each. After multiple serving errors in the first set, the Gauchos found their rhythm and cleaned up their performance at the service line.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Jake Staahl also had an impressive performance, leading the Gaucho defense with a team high of eight blocks. Despite holding the Cougars to a .107 hitting percentage in the second set and dominating in the third, the Gauchos lost their momentum and gave up the fourth set to the Cougars.</p>\n<p>“They turned it up with their serves,” Seif said. “Once they are in their complete rhythm they are a really tough team to stop.”</p>\n<p>After falling in the fourth set the Gauchos were unable to bounce back. The Cougars took the victory in the fifth set with a final score of 15-13. Senior outside hitter Taylor Sander led BYU with a team-high 27 kills and had eight blocks on the night. Sophomore opposite Matt Underwood also had an impressive performance against the Gauchos, ending the night with 11 kills hitting .625.</p>\n<p>Taking down UCSB and UCLA in this past weekend, BYU moves forward with an overall record of 18-4 and a conference record of 18-2.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating that we lost, but overall it put us in a good position to show where have come as a team,” said senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson. “Going to five with the number one team in the league showed us that we could compete with the best, and potentially beat the best.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in the week, UCSB took down Cal Baptist on the road in a quick three-game sweep. The Gauchos were able to get their momentum going early in this game, holding Cal Baptist to .034 hitting percentage in the first set.</p>\n<p>A large determinant of the Gauchos’ success this season has been their overall number of digs in a game. Senior libero Chad Kingi led the team with 10 digs against the Lancers after coming off a career-high night against Pepperdine with 19 digs.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist now holds an overall record 4-20 and a conference record of 2-18.</p>\n<p>Despite splitting their matches, the Gauchos are still in contention for the postseason with the possibility of hosting the first round match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue on the road with games against Long Beach State on Thursday and Northridge on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of March 31, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54501\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/no-5-gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54501\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/no-5-gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/no-5-gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/no-5-gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/no-5-gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":5230,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5229,5228,5227],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Down to Crunch Time","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Volleyball_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Volleyball_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Can Clinch a Playoff Spot with Wins Over Long Beach, Northridge","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s volleyball team faces a crucial week ahead as it fights to maintain a ranking in the final weeks before postseason play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hit the road for the last time this season, matching up against No. 5 Long Beach State today and Cal State Northridge Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB holds a strong overall record of 14-7 and a conference record of 13-7.

Only the top eight teams will advance to the MPSF Tournament. As of now, BYU has secured the No. 1 seed, but there still is a very tight race for the seven remaining spots.</p>\n<p>“This week is big; we are currently tied for third with a few other teams,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “With these last four matches, you could finish anywhere from second to ninth.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will enter tonight’s match against Long Beach coming off of a recent loss at BYU. Typically, entering a match off a loss halts momentum, or lowers a team’s morale, but it seems to be anything but the case for this Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>“The mentality this week has been good. We consider BYU the best team in the country and we took them 15-13 at their place. No one else has been able to do that this year,” junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen said. “We know how good we can be and we are just trying to translate that over into practice for Long Beach this week.”</p>\n<p>The key to success for the Gauchos this season has been their ability to serve and pass the ball well. Heading into this week’s games, UCSB will look to senior opposite Evan Licht and senior libero Chad Kingi to uphold these elements.</p>\n<p>Licht has dominated the service line this season, currently holding a team high 32 service aces. Kingi has anchored the back row for the Gauchos all year and is currently averaging 2.17 digs per set.</p>\n<p>Another asset to the Gaucho lineup this week is junior middle blocker Jake Staahl. Staahl is ranked fifth in the nation in blocks, averaging 1.30 per set and currently holds a team high hitting percentage of .408. UCSB will rely on Staahl to shut down some of Long Beach State’s key players.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will enter tonight’s matchup coming off of a 3-0 loss to UC Irvine. Earlier this season when the Gauchos hosted the Prospectors they defeated them in a four set match.</p>\n<p>The biggest threat for the Gauchos heading into tonight’s game will be nationally-ranked senior outside hitter Taylor Crabb. Crabb leads the nation with an average of 4.80 kills per set and has yet to see a match where he hasn’t reached double digits. Another challenge for UCSB will be Long Beach’s impressive 9-1 record at home this conference season.</p>\n<p>“In the past we have gone down to Long Beach not ready to play,” Nielsen said. “We need to go down there ready to play from the beginning and we will be fine.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB will travel to play Cal State Northridge. CSUN currently holds an overall record of 8-15 and are ranked 10th in the MPSF.
