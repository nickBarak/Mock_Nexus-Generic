I asked them to come out focused. “</p>\n<p>Four players finished in double figures for the Gauchos in the third consecutive game in which UCSB has found successful offensive flow. Senior guard Emilie Johnson led team with 12 points, five rebounds, and five assists while Mason contributed 11. Junior forward Sweets Underwood and senior forward Kelsey Adrian finished with 10 apiece.</p>\n<p>“We’re much more confident, we’re getting a really good flow, and we’re knocking down shots when we’re open,” Mason said. “If [we] have four players in double figures, we’re going to win the games because we’re stopping people defensively.”</p>\n<p>Adrian, who has been held scoreless in two of the last three games, opened up the ball game with a three. Mason, who was playing in front of friends and family, followed in suit with another trey and the Gauchos quickly jumped out to a 14-4 lead.</p>\n<p>“This game, every time I shot, I thought, ‘this [is] going in’,” Mason said. “With my first shot, I was like, ‘this is it.’ I was very excited when it went it and it carried on throughout the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, which is known for its slow starts, was red hot, opening up the game 4-6 from the field and 2-2 from downtown. At halftime, the Gauchos were shooting 41 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re taking good shots,” Mitchell said. “Plus, we were pushing the ball in transition and getting layups is great for their confidence.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also stuck to their bread and butter, playing tremendous defense and holding UCR to 15.4 percent shooting in the first half. Their 12 first half points was the fourth lowest opponent total for a half in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>“Our kids were on it,” Mitchell said. “Last game we gave up some early shots, so we worked on making all their looks contested shots. It was a total team effort in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t miss a beat entering the second period and mounted an 11-0 run to bury UCR. However, the Highlanders generated a comeback and the Gauchos watched a 21 point lead diminish to just 10.</p>\n<p>“When we’re up 21, we can’t let them up back in the game,” Mason said. “If it was a better team, they would’ve taken advantage of that. We can’t be content, and I think we got a little content.”</p>\n<p>While Mason kept Riverside’s star, junior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, in check in the first half with just three points, she finished with 16. Although she only shot 3-13, she made 9-10 from the line.</p>\n<p>“[Stopping Nottingham early] was the number one key to the game,” Mason said. “That was the only thing I was thinking about. I knew she liked to get to the basket so I wanted to make sure she didn’t get to the basket. Also, I think we did great team wise because the guards were great with helping.”</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a road game against UC Irvine Saturday. The Gauchos will seek revenge after a poor showing in the last match-up, a 61-53 loss.</p>\n<p>“They’re extremely athletic and I think our team will remember what they did to us last game,” Mitchell said. “They’re in the middle of the pack, so we’re going to have to have a more complete effort. We can’t have those let downs late the game.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 4 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/","id":751,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[750,749,748],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hosts No. 71 Nevada, Pacific to Begin Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Pacific this weekend, the team it beat in last year's Big West Tournament championship game.

In order to win upcoming matches, they will need to take the first point in the overall match and push the momentum in order to beat these top teams.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing entertaining matches,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “They’re close; we’d like to be on the other side of a few more of them.”</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, Nevada had won its last four matches and is 5-2 overall, defeating Cal Poly, USF, Arizona and Grand Canyon. The team is led by junior Moaz Chargui in the top singles spot followed by senior Victor Ouvrard, sophomore Andrew Poustie and senior Quentin Mege. The top doubles pairs will consist of Echargui and Mege, Ouvrard and freshman Robert Allan and Poustie with junior Fernando Sunago.</p>\n<p>“Nevada has a lot of international players, very steady, don’t make a lot of unforced errors and [they are] very good,” Davis said. “I expect it to be a very close match.”</p>\n<p>Nevada played Pepperdine last night and will return home for a stretch of matches at its home court after playing UCSB.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Pacific will be coming into Santa Barbara looking for vengeance after the Gauchos knocked the Tigers out of the Big West Tournament last spring. Though no longer in the Big West Conference, the Tigers will be another tough test for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are 3-5 overall and won their last match over Sacramento State 7-0. They will be playing Cal Poly on Saturday before coming down the 101 to take on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We edged this team in the finals last year for the conference title,” Davis said. “They aren’t in our conference anymore but I’m sure they will all remember that. I’m sure they’ll be looking for some revenge.”</p>\n<p>Pacific is led by its star sophomore Sem Verbeek. Verbeek was named Big West Conference Freshman of the Year in 2013. He also was named to the All-Big West First Team and earned All-Big West First Team for doubles with his partner Alex Golding, who has since graduated. Verbeek will be playing doubles this year with his new partner, freshman Miguel Diaz.</p>\n<p>Following Verbeek in the lineup will be sophomore Daniel Alameh, junior Denis Stolyarov, Diaz, junior Ben Mirkin and junior Alex Hamilton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look to end their losing ways starting today at 1:30 p.m. against Nevada and then take on Pacific at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Both matches will be played at the tennis courts behind the Recreational Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/","id":748,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[747,746,745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Tough Decision to San Jose State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB dropped a 4-3 decision on the road against San Jose State this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis traveled to the Bay Area on Saturday to face San Jose State and dropped a tough decision 4-3. Santa Barbara was looking for a win in San Jose, which would have resulted in its first two-game win streak of the season. However, San Jose outlasted UCSB and dropped the Gauchos to a 2-8 record overall with a 1-1 conference record. Meanwhile with the victory, the Spartans boosted themselves to 5-8 overall.</p>\n<p>The day started well for the Gauchos, who split the singles matches 3-3. UCSB’s junior Stacy Yam defeated junior Julianna Bacelar of SJSU at the fourth spot 6-4, 6-2. Santa Barbara freshman Jaimee Gilbertson beat junior Jessica Willett of San Jose 6-3, 6-4 at the fifth spot and sophomore Luisa Ortiz Candido was victorious over freshman Tipper Truong 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The match was to be decided by the doubles matches, a section where the Gauchos have been trying to improve significantly. San Jose outperformed the Gauchos, however, and drubbed UCSB in the doubles matches to gain the final point and consequently the victory over the Gauchos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara dropped the first doubles match 8-6 as the duo of junior April Scatliffe/sophomore Priscila Garcia fell to the Spartans’ freshman Gaelle Rey/senior Sabastiani Leon Chao 8-6.

The game against Riverside didn’t go exactly as I thought it would. We came out pretty flat and basically played like shit the first half, but we managed to put together a decent second half and were able to win, which is all that matters really. Now this road trip I don’t think anyone is looking forward to. We’re driving down Tuesday afternoon, playing Wednesday night and driving back to SB after the game Wednesday night only to get back on the bus Thursday around noon to drive back down to LAX for our flight to Utah where we’re playing Utah State on Saturday night for our bracket buster game. Get back on Sunday at some time and then on Tuesday we leave for Long Beach. So it’s gonna be a long week of playing good teams and sitting around the hotel doing jack shit. Can’t believe we have to go back to Utah. Only rThis eason I want to go to Utah is to snowboard. Provo was boring as hell and I don’t have very high expectations for Logan either. Why we are driving back to SB just to go back down to LA less than 12 hours later beats the hell outta me. I suppose it’s for the guys to go to class but let’s be honest here, who is going to attend class when we’re only home for a few hours. Probably only one player and that’s Boswell who’s a mechanical engineering major, so it’s understandable. On another note this is probably the nicest winter we’ve had in SB since I’ve been up here. Knock on wood and hope it continues because it never gets old. Enjoy it while you can because it’s not gonna last forever and it being my last few months here has made me appreciate Santa Barbara even more. That’s all I got for now, gonna throw on my headphones and stare at the oil rigs and islands as we drive down the 101 with Stormin’ Norman at the wheel.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44686\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44686\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/","id":750,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[749,748,747],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
