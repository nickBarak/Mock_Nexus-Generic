When will we stand up? When will we ‘rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful struggle for a new world?’”</p>\n<p>Since I was now at the end of the article, I wondered about the logic of condemning war that defends Americans, because it is bad, and calling for war at the barricades, because it is good.

This was the latest in a series of meetings held over the past few years between University of California, Santa Barbara administration and various campus constituencies concerning the UC budget cuts. During that meeting, Lucas effectively said, “It is not ‘us’ (the UC system, or UCSB, for that matter), it is ‘them’ (the California State Legislature).” While this may have some validity — indeed, there have been massive cuts from the state to the UC system for years, or really decades now — in all likelihood, the state legislature will turn around and claim, “Well, it is not our fault, it is the federal government’s fault.” In turn, the feds will assert, “It is not our fault either, it is the global economic system’s fault,” or, better yet, “It is China’s fault.”</p>\n<p>In April 1970, on the very first Earth Day — held partially in response to the infamous oil spill that occurred one year earlier, right here in Santa Barbara — the late comic strip artist Walt Kelly declared in Pogo, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Lucas would have us believe that the “enemy” is the California State Legislature, which it is, but this narrative absolves the UC system and UCSB from any culpability regarding this current mess that we’re in. It is not just their fault, it is the UC’s fault too. But let’s take a step back here, for a moment. Is it only the state legislature’s responsibility? Don’t they have less money because the federal government has cut back funding too? I would say yes, but why don’t they have sufficient funds and resources anymore? Why are the feds so “poor?”</p>\n<p>On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City, one year before he was assassinated, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered one of his most impassioned, militant and, sadly, often-overlooked speeches, titled, “A Time to Break Silence.” In that talk, King sharply and eloquently observed that one of the primary reasons why people of color in first and third world countries were rising up and demanding change was that their basic needs were not being met. He boldly stated that the United States is “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,” and people’s needs were not being met because the U.S. was engaged in a “senseless, unjust war,” as he said in his “Drum Major Instinct” sermon, delivered on February 4, 1968.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With our “peace-loving” country currently in three wars that we know about, don’t these words ring true today more than ever?

With the United States having more prisoners in the world than any other nation, don’t these words ring true?</p>\n<p>To quote Marcellus from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “There is something rotten in the state of Denmark,” but what smells isn’t just UCSB, the UC system or the California State Legislature (or our good old friend Jerry Brown, who the seminal punk band the Dead Kennedys mocked in the late 1970s) — it is militarism, imperialism and, dare I say, the capitalist system we all live in. Every day we passively participate in this system. I do too. I buy into consumerism and turn a blind eye while suffering takes place; this passivity makes me the enemy, too.</p>\n<p>I thus agree with Pogo — we have met the enemy and he is us, but in saying this, let’s not forget that a larger enemy is out there. In the ’60s, they called it the “system.” In the ’90s, people raged against the machine in Chiapas, in Los Angeles and in South Korea. Even here, at UCSB, nine students staged a nine-day water-only hunger strike in April 1994 to push for lower student fees, a community center for low-income families in Isla Vista, and more outreach programs to recruit and retain Latina and Latino students from the surrounding three counties (Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo). They also pushed to ban table grapes from campus, maintain El Centro and strengthen and expand the Chicana and Chicano Studies Dept.</p>\n<p>That effort was not entirely successful, but it did bring about change — without it, this campus would look much different than it does today, meaning the campus did increase its efforts to recruit students of color. Without it, the Chicana and Chicano Studies Dept. would have no Ph.D. program. Without it, teens in Isla Vista would not have a space to “kick back and relax,” which they can do at the I.V. Teen Center. Change took place. Many years ago, Frederick Douglass said, “Power never concedes nothing without a demand, it never did and it never will.”</p>\n<p>We know who the enemies are and how we can defeat or challenge them. In his Riverside speech against the Vietnam War, King called for a revolution in values and, most provocatively, “love.” King believed in the power of love; not sentimental, romantic love, but love in action — that is, organizing a multi-racial coalition of poor people, as he hoped to do before he was killed, to ameliorate poverty and suffering in the United States. Love in action can mean many different things; for folk-singer Woody Guthrie it meant displaying the words “this machine kills fascists” on the side of his guitar. For the Good Samaritan — based on the biblical story from Luke in the New Testament — it meant not fleeing in haste as the priest and Levite did, but getting his hands dirty, helping the “man” who had been beaten and left for dead, tending to his wounds and then taking him to an inn where he returned and paid for his room and board. What did love in action look like recently?</p>\n<p>It looked like 20 people marching through campus demanding that the abstract thing we call “budget cuts” stop because they are hurting people — workers are overworked and stressed out and some have become literally sick as a result of changes such as “clustering,” which is a fancy term for increasing one’s job responsibilities without any pay increase or eliminating one’s job altogether.</p>\n<p>These cuts are literally “cutting” people up — they are barely hanging on and that is really no way to live, is it? Most of us are hanging on by a thread and we are happy to be working and living in our own homes (which many people do not, as witnessed by the foreclosure mess and staggeringly high levels of homelessness), but we all have our breaking points. How much longer can this go on until we see a massive uprising — a progressive or radical one, at that — here in the United States?</p>\n<p>In his Riverside speech, King quoted former President John F. Kennedy, who famously stated, “Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible, make violent revolutions inevitable.” I hope and, yes, pray, that this doesn’t come to pass. I abhor violence, but something must change and change soon. In 1964, Sam Cooke sang about a “long change that is gonna come.” Well, it has come, but so much more needs to be done. When will it happen? When will we stand up? When will we “rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful struggle for a new world,” as King said? When will it be?</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval is a professor in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40553\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-06-22/professor-calls-activism-accountability-love-action/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40553\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-06-22/professor-calls-activism-accountability-love-action/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-06-22/professor-calls-activism-accountability-love-action/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-06-22/professor-calls-activism-accountability-love-action/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-06-22/professor-calls-activism-accountability-love-action/","id":6157,"author":{"id":551,"name":"Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval"},"related":[6156,6155,6154],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thank You, UCSB, for the Beach, the Parties and … the Classes?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Of course, I’m not going on exchange to go to class,” I would nonchalantly announce to anyone who would ask me what I was hoping to do on exchange at UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Of course, I’m not going on exchange to go to class,” I would nonchalantly announce to anyone who would ask me what I was hoping to do on exchange at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Before I came here on exchange, I remember listening in awe to a student from my home university in Australia.

As an Australian of Chinese descent, I am so grateful that I stumbled across ethnic studies classes and I am so envious that some people create whole majors out of them!</p>\n<p>As far as I know, ethnic studies doesn’t exist in Australian universities, which is bizarre considering almost 50 percent of Australians were either born overseas or had one or both parents born overseas. For the first time in my life, I was provided with safe spaces to explore deeply vulnerable and important parts of who I am.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I would be delighted even by the classes my home university required me to take here. My teachers for both my compulsory and optional classes were refreshingly generous. They truly engaged with us in class, during office hours and even out of class. I had professors and teaching assistants who took me to coffee and lunch and even hosted end of quarter parties at their homes.</p>\n<p>In a few weeks, when school in Australia starts up again, I’ll be sharing all sorts of exchange anecdotes and tips to the uninitiated at my university — students about to go on exchange at UCSB. I’ll tell them about the fun they’ll have living in Isla Vista (maybe even at one of the extraordinary housing cooperatives), the beauty of the beach and mountains, the spectacle of DP, the terror of the bike paths, the possibilities of travel and the amazing friends they’ll make.</p>\n<p>And I’ll also be sure to tell them to go to class.

You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn’t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”</p>\n<p>Warren correctly points out that people who operate businesses rely on the government to provide certain services, but I believe her assertion about an individual’s obligation to pay more in taxes is based on a narrow worldview that makes too many incorrect assumptions about the disposition and abilities of our government.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first thing we need to do when we talk about paying our fair share of taxes is to take off  Warren’s rose-tinted glasses and examine both the positive and negative things the government does with our tax money. Yes, Warren loves to tell us about how the government uses our income to fund education and infrastructure, but she conveniently forgets to mention that last year the government spent $663.7 billion (18.74 percent of the 2010 federal budget) of our taxes on the Department of Defense so we could operate 737 military installations across the globe and continue funding the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan for the seventh and ninth respective years. Similarly, the government continues to spend our tax dollars on the war on drugs, which it has been losing since 1971. Currently, the government spends billions of our tax dollars on the Environmental Protection Agency in an attempt to curb pollution, and then spends billions more to subsidize the oil industry that causes so much pollution in the first place.<br>\nThe message to take away from all this is that for every nice thing the government does with our tax dollars, it also does quite a few not-so-nice things. Yes, the government builds classrooms for kids, but it also builds holding cells in Guantanamo Bay. Yes, the government spends our tax dollars to police the streets and keep us safe, but the government also spends our tax dollars on the TSA so we can be groped for the sake of security while waiting in line at the airport. Yes, the federal government built the interstate highway system in the middle of the last century, but it also sent thousands of Japanese-Americans to internment camps. The next time Warren tells you it’s your societal obligation to pay your taxes forward, think long and hard about where your money will actually end up.</p>\n<p>But for the sake of argument, let’s pretend the government only spends our tax money on nice things like schools, roads and firefighters. All too often, we forget to ask ourselves if the government is actually any good at doing these things, and, if so, at what cost?</p>\n<p>Let’s talk education. It’s no secret that America’s public school system is not up to speed. It’s also no secret that America’s private schools largely outperform our public schools run by the government. Many say that this is because the public schools are under-funded and would perform much better if only they had deeper pockets, but a quick thought experiment quickly clears up this misconception. Imagine you had the choice of sending your hypothetical child to either a public school or a private school, on the condition that each school had the same amount of money to spend educating your child. Dollar for dollar, the private school always wins because the people who run the private school have a vested interest in doing their job well. In the private school, providing a top-notch education means more profits, whereas in the public school — where revenue is not dependent on the quality of the services rendered — it just means more work.</p>\n<p>Just as private schools outperform public schools, privately owned toll roads outperform pothole-ridden public roads because of the profit motive. Similarly, government operated police and fire units are easily replaced by volunteer organizations. In fact, volunteer fire departments have a special place in American history: Benjamin Franklin himself helped organize one of America’s first volunteer fire departments in Philadelphia. Volunteer police also exist in America in the form of neighborhood watch groups, the only cost of which is the time donated by their participants. (Yes, there are many important details as to how a volunteer police force would function, but that is in itself an article for another day.)</p>\n<p>As Warren’s words continue to reverberate in the media, we must remember that, at the end of the day, her goal is to get elected to the senate.
