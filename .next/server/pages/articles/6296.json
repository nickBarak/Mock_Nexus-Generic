We could still hear the ballistic frat boy rants and skinny dip squeals vibrating the small college town of Isla Vista, California, making me feel that much more pleased that I was with him instead of them this young night. I looked at his face without touching, and I was bewildered. Bewildered that we hadn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t kissed yet, as this was exactly the kind of patient romance I had been yearning for, even though he was going back to the Bay tomorrow. I sighed. I swooned. We talked about life and art, and god knows I get consensually weak with that. We heard the ocean crash the way our energies were uniting and so he proposed that we go to the beach and just be. Classic. But WAIT. I heard a piercing siren go off in my dreamy mind. WAIT. BEEP BEEP. Was the sex about to happen? Cum on. You know what I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">m talking about, baby. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sex that is inevitable if a good conversation leads to a walk on the beach and Freebirds would probably close soon anyway, right? Nothing left to do but to be bare. WAIT.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the fucking going to happen so fast again? It</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s damn over at that point. What a shame. He probably will never talk to me again or see me the same because of sexist bullshit. Fuck. But I actually like him and I think he actually likes me. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hesitated for a breath before my sexual and spiritual attraction got up and left with him.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the curveball was that I actually loved going to the beach with him. This time, the beach and a boy didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t feel like a situation of objectification. There wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t that tense air of expectation I had so easily pleased in the past just to make things more comfortable. NO. There was no having sex just because I felt responsible for giving it or kissing because it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s what people do in the dark. I enjoyed other things. I was mystified over holding hands because it felt organic, just like the dialogue dripping from our tongues in spaces that would otherwise be spent interlocking our predestined-to-be-nude bodies on a mossy rock way more uncomfortable than either of us would have admitted later on. I knew our lips were about to spark with that last stormy wave caressing the sand, and so they did with giggles plucking harp strings of the wind mixed with an original song in my head shrieking </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is different. Maybe this is real</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a word overused with love stories, and no longer can I feel why this situation was different in comparison to others that might have been overlooked or silenced. Why? Because I am numb to all of my sexual fantasies at this point, where the fantasy part to my longings was having sex with someone I liked who also liked me back. The fantasy was having an experience where sex was a manifestation of developed respect between him and myself and an attraction expressing itself in another way, not needing sex as the only way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted lust and freedom intertwined with intimacy and learning. Being together just because we are human and that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s what humans enjoy. I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t stop having sex that night, even though this guy and I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t have sex. I liked him too much for that. I stopped having sex when I realized that I stopped having sex with people I liked because I liked them, and they may have liked me too, which meant that I was having sex with people that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t truly enjoy and who didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know me or care to either. DONE. Muthafuckin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GAME OVER for me to have casual sex when the casualness of it made me forget what pleasure sex brought to my lovely vagina in the first place. I think I got confused. I love sex. I love having sex. I started casual sex because it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s fun and it feels good. But I kept up casual sex because I wanted it to turn into a deep connection with someone, and casual sex is one of the only opportunities I saw to get to know a being (through as the side effect of spillover time, like whispering things before bed or sharing your class schedule with them the next day).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I don</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t remember this situation being that different, because at the end of it, he still asked for sex, and even though I said no, I couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think that all of the fluff was fluff to lead up to fucking, like foreplay to the foreplay. He left the next day and has barely contacted me since, and it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s quite all right. But I also couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t help but think of how many times things felt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">different</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like that, and I did, in fact, like that person, and they may or may not have liked me, but either having sex even though I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to yet or not having sex because I LIKED THEM AND DID WANT IT kept me from experiencing this true difference to its most bloomed form. I also thought about all those moments lost in the limbo toxic hole of being NUMB after hurting through sex, like when I was not acknowledged by them again afterward or when I forced myself not to have sex even though it was probably a beautiful time to do it with someone or when I just laid there and forgot that sex was happening to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt used, nothing, everything, scared, deprived, restless, horny, asexual, invaded and bored that I stopped having sex actively for six months last year. It was at the peak of my wild feelings and out-of-control substance use and emotions that couldn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t be contained. But I let it go because I knew what it felt like and it didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t feel like what I needed and wanted to be healthy. I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t know exactly what I wanted from sexuality, but I knew what I did not want from it and life. So, I cut those ties and I did not have sex even when I liked others, because, this time, it wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t because I liked them that I didn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t want to get hurt or move </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too quickly,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it was because I actually had nothing to give and nothing I wanted to take. I was floating on in life and finding happiness in crevices that surprised me. I was reigniting my senses to feel and be awake to life all around where I once was taken from and not replenished. I was replenishing myself and understanding what I need from sex and what I can give. I also understood my selfish reasons for having sex before and the ways in which I put myself in situations continuously that were not in synch with my soul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s true nature. I became me and I understood and respected what makes me most vibrant. I tried then to get to know other people, and for the first time, to get to know everyone as just a friend without the prospects of sex or love. I let go of using them to project my own fantasies onto and I tried to be less self-centered. They are all people. Beautiful, wondrous people, and I wanted to know who they were outside of sex or a buildup to it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were quite astonishing. They were wonderful. I fell in love with people again, and I fell in love with myself. I traveled and laughed. I ate and let go. I got full again, and I was ready to give when time allowed it. Since then I have had sex with one person and it was all very natural. I am living open to sexuality, but open to a redefined, reclaimed version of sexuality that includes so much nurturance, reciprocity, consent, respect, amusement, safety, excitement, fun and love that it will not be everywhere at any time. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a sexuality that is me and it is back and better than ever, even if it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s not always active in sex. It is always active inside of me. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

own education and its downfalls. I realized that while high schools fail to provide an adequate foundation for sexual education, universities do little to fix the damage. I contemplated what my high school did wrong and asked myself: what should UCSB  do to ensure that its students receive a comprehensive sexual health education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended an incredibly liberal private high school in the heart of Silicon Valley. While the school excelled in many ways and prepared us to succeed academically, they failed to prepare us for living as individuals in society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our required sex ed class took place during freshman year. It was a quarter long class that met  once a week for fifty minutes. Because of its bland and unengaged delivery, its lack of both general information and specifics and its decision not to hold us accountable for retaining the material, it was clear this would be a slack-off class. My fellow 14 and 15 year old classmates either used the class to frantically study for upcoming tests, zone out and take a much needed mental break, or hang out with friends and make crude jokes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of classes that we had to suffer through in school that were beyond boring. Even in classes with lifeless, passionless teachers, we were forced to be engaged. We were constantly cold-called, tested and asked to turn in assignments that prove our understanding. Zoning out, talking and working on material or studying for another class was actively prohibited. However, all of these actions were rampant in our sex ed course. So why was this all allowed to take place? Why were the sex ed class standards so different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it’s pretty clear. My school did not emphasize its importance as much as other subjects we studied. Literally every single class that students were required to take had some sort of testing system to ensure that students were actually learning the material. That is, every class except for sex ed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew the class was a joke, but it wasn’t until the beginning of my senior year that I realized how pathetic it really was. During my free period, my friend told a group of us that she finally got an IUD. She was super happy about it and recommended it to all of us. She said that, besides its obvious use to protect against pregnancy, it basically stopped her period and cleared her skin. The two girls I was sitting with responded by asking, “wait, what’s an IUD?” They were unaware of other contraceptives besides condoms and birth control pills, so they resorted to birth control — despite the negative physical reactions. Because their knowledge of contraceptives, like various IUDs or the NuvaRing, was sparse, the girls relied on their peers for sexual health information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girls peppered the IUD-bearer with a multitude of questions, reinforcing the nationwide trend of teens relying on other teens and the media to educate themselves and make up for their lack of a formal sexual education. This kind of behavior stems from poor education and leads to false rumors and facts. One example of these harmful rumors is Plan B does not work after you’ve taken it three times. Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I was shocked at the pure illiteracy of some of my peers when it came to basic sexual health and anatomy. I came to this realization during a conversation that took place in DLG at the beginning of my freshman year. My friend mentioned that her boyfriend had just gotten tested and that we should get tested, just to make sure. One girl stated that she didn’t need to get tested because she would be able to tell if she had one. What she did not understand is that many STIs are often asymptomatic. Another girl responded that she did not need to get tested because she only blows people. What she and many others fail to understand is that STIs can be transmitted through oral sex, even if you spit, and through pre-ejaculate via oral or vaginal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, their comments may just seem like pure ignorance or stupidity, but, when assessing the potential consequences of their actions or lack of actions, it reflects a public health concern. These girls’ lack of education is a reason why STIs are spreading. Even though we are in a time of incredibly modernized medicine, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections are at a record high. In fact, Chlamydia accounts for the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC states that, “one in two sexually active persons will contract an STI by age 25.” Why is this? Well, only about 12% of young people were tested in the last year (CDC), so people continue to spread them through unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STIs are not just a nuisance. They have lasting effects with grave consequences. New strains of STIs emerge every year that are becoming harder and harder to treat. The CDC estimates that, “nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year in this country”. One recent infection that has garnered attention is Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea. This strain is resistant to our current antibiotics, making it much harder to treat — sometimes impossible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it important that you treat STIs? Well, they can result in serious damage with lasting effects later in life. For instance, the CDC estimates that “undiagnosed STIs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.” Women are potentially made infertile if Chlamydia evolves into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, which is often a sign of carelessness as a result of a poor education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, there are a lot of great resources and information that UCSB provides to its students surrounding sexual health. However, most students are not taking advantage of these resources, even when they are in need of educating. So, what should UCSB be doing for its students to ensure that we all receive an acceptable sexual education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thought is to have a required online course, similar to that of sexual assault and drug and alcohol education course. However, the issue with these courses is that they are easy to skip through which makes it rather easy to not actually learn any of the information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea would be to make it a GE requirement to take a course similar to the Baldwins’ highly regarded Sociology of Human Sexuality course. The course covers topics such as abortion, birth control, emergency contraception, Planned Parenthood, STIs, domestic violence, and UCSB sex culture and statistics. It is not only one of the longest running classes taught in the history of UCSB, it is one of the most popular. The popularity of this class and the increase in STI testing directly after the STI lecture reveals that students are not only uninformed, but they also want to gain a better understanding of the subject. Requiring students to take this class, or a class with similar content, would serve the student body well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health. It should be more heavily integrated into university curriculums because college is meant not only to give degrees, but to prepare us for the future as informed citizens of the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Claire Horsley wants to ensure that Gauchos are as educated in the bedroom as they are in the classroom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Really beginning to ask myself what I felt and why it was I felt that way helped clarify my emotions, and being able to give a reason to those clarified emotions gave me comfort and acceptance. If you’re able to feel comfortable with and accept your own feelings, that often alleviates some of the stress of expressing those emotions to someone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not comfortable being alone naked in a room with someone, you probably shouldn’t be having sex.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the stress that contributes to being honest with someone is the idea of vulnerability. Particularly in physical relationships,  there are many ways to be vulnerable to your partner and if an open, accepting environment hasn’t been established, expressing your honest opinion could very well be one of those ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as we hate to admit it, vulnerability will inevitably play a role in every sexual relationship we have, the first reason being that we’re naked. Unless you have been gifted with the shamelessness of a baby, being naked is a very vulnerable experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the seventh grade, my health teacher prefaced his sex talk with “If you’re not comfortable being alone naked in a room with someone, you probably shouldn’t be having sex.” At that point in my life, I wasn’t even comfortable being naked in a room by myself. Point being: we are all vulnerable from time to time, and acknowledging and accepting that vulnerability could do us wonders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to sexual vulnerability, whether it be with a new partner or with someone you’ve been with for years, there is often a pressing concern about whether or not what you’re doing is making your partner feel good, or whether or not you will be able to make them orgasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to be clear, no, sex is not like it appears in the movies. You will not always know your partner’s body,  and while WikiHow may be able to generally describe to you in bullet points “How to Give a Blow Job” or “What Makes a Girl Cum,” I can guarantee that no article would be able to tell you better than your partner would. Surprise, people masturbate and know their bodies! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something feels good, tell your partner, because chances are, they’re wondering just like you are and the affirmation could even add to the moment. It doesn’t have to be some elaborate PowerPoint about the logistics of your G-spot or a graph representing the sensitivity of your tip, but a simple “Don’t stop” could do the trick. Plus, what’s sexier than being able to trust and communicate with your partner?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being honest also means that when something doesn’t feel good, you express that too. When your partner asks “Does that feel good?” and you respond “Uhhh, yeah…” then neither of you are is getting anything out of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reinforcing the idea that what they’re doing feels good while you are either in pain or feeling nothing and your partner is completely misled. How are they supposed to know? And yes, there are the “obvious” physical reactions we have to sexual stimulation, but being told something doesn’t feel good will have a more “productive outcome” than someone trying to guess whether or not their partner is wet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes dicks just aren’t meant to bend the way you want them to bend and that’s something honesty has taught me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being completely honest, sex is so much better when you’re actually genuinely enjoying yourself and not worrying about whether or not you’re making your partner feel good. If your partner tells you and shows you how to make them feel good, you can probably assume with a higher degree of certainty that you’re making them feel pretty damn good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are many more aspects to physical relationships, honesty gives you the freedom, power and peace of mind to enjoy yourself and your partner. While I’ve primarily detailed honesty in physical relationships, I do believe honesty is important in every relationship whether that be with lovers, friends, family or even acquaintances,  and though the vulnerability and discomfort that comes with honesty is difficult to overcome, in the long run, your relationship, your partner and yourself will be able to benefit.</span></p>\n<p><em>Aryana

No, it’s not just there to potentially give people life-threatening cancer; in fact, the prostate is a magical organ that can provide men with a type of bliss that’s hard to match.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, guys, you might be telling yourselves that it’s “gay” to put stuff up your butt in a sexual way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m here to say, “Nope! Not gay at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you attracted to other men? If you answered yes, then okay, yeah, you might be gay. However, if you answered with a resounding no, then you’re not gay, you’re just curious what a dildo might feel like stuffed up your anal canal. The act of fucking yourself in the ass isn’t what’s gay — rather, it’s the attraction to who is doing the fucking.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time I suggested butt play to my current partner, he agreed because it seemed like something I really wanted to do, not because he thought it would feel good. That opinion changed pretty quickly after I slipped a finger into his ass while giving the most enthusiastic blowjob I’ve ever performed. After a bit more stimulation, he came from fellatio for the second time in his life, so it’s safe to say he was probably into it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was even better next time when I got further in and found his prostate. I knew I had struck sex gold when I started massaging the smooth, stiff, spherical lump that lives up there and my guy’s eyes rolled into the back of his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He came to when he thought he felt like he was going to pee. Instead, he began leaking an insane amount of pre-cum. Like, it was a small stream flowing down his dick onto his stomach. He freaked out for a second because he didn’t understand what was going on, but once he figured out it wasn’t a sign he was dying, he got waaayyyyy more enthusiastic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this session, both of us realized a few things: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) My fingers were too short and his ass was too tight for me to really get up there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) We both wanted to take this much further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, we talked about it and decided to implement some toys into this new pastime of ours. The existence of toys was not new to us, but, thus far, they’d only been stuck into me. Because it was known by both of us that I was more well-versed in sexual safety and just sexual knowledge in general (thank you, r/sex), Boy trusted me with obtaining the first pocket rocket to enter his butt.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that looking for an ass dildo was going to be different than looking for a pussy dildo for a few reasons. First off, assholes tend to be much tighter than vaginas, so preparation and build-up was going to take longer. This meant that I had to start small and go from there so I didn’t make his butthole a buttchasm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, the shape of the new object needed to be unique so that the prostate would be adequately stimulated. After all, that’s the whole reason we’re doing this. So I started looking at dildos that had a slight curve to them, as suggested by my online research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I looked for something with a smooth texture for easy insertion. I settled on a glass dildo from Amazon for $10 that’s about seven inches long and 1.5 inches in circumference. It has anal beads on one side and a pointed tip on the other for maximum pleasure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I wasn’t planning on letting go while doing the deed, I wasn’t too concerned with finding an ass dildo with a base flare — something commonly suggested to keep shit from getting stuck up there without a way out. My subsequent purchases are definitely going to have a base, though, because I underestimated the slipperiness of lube on glass. Nothing got lost, but it was definitely hard to maintain a stable grip while thrusting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you, that thing is magical. It had Boy begging me to fuck harder, and afterward he said he almost came from just that nearly three times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He reported that his dick was “sore from being so hard,” but he also said that wasn’t a bad thing. Apparently, the orgasm from a mixture of him fucking me and the dildo in his ass was much more intense than a normal one. He described it as an orgasm he would have after not cumming for a week or so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, he was the one asking me to fuck him — not me. The next thing on our list is a legitimate strap-on that I’ll use to peg him, which honestly shocked me a bit because I wasn’t even the one to suggest it. I thought we’d go about this process in small increments, maybe a butt plug here and there, but I definitely did not ever picture myself full-on pegging him. Once he proposed it, though, I couldn’t think about anything else. I don’t think I’ll be able to until it actually comes to fruition (which will hopefully be soon).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll leave y’all with a compressed list of Dos and Don’ts in case reading this sparked some curiosity in you and you want to try your hand at sticking things in orifices:</span></p>\n<p><b>DO go slow.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like any muscle, the anus has to get warmed up before it gets positively rammed, and this can take a few days. That’s right: days. The act of relaxing enough to allow something up your butt takes a while to master, so try incorporating some mild ass play into the sexy times leading up to the big shebang. Also, the feeling of needing to poop might need some getting used to as well (that never really goes away).</span></p>\n<p><b>DO use lots of lube.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Again, assholes are tight. You’re gonna need something to help ease the dildo in there, and lube kinda exists to do that. Make sure you use the right lube, though. Silicone-based lube should never be used with silicone toys because it compromises the integrity of the toy’s structure. Also, oil-based lubes shouldn’t be used with safer sex barriers (i.e. condoms) because those will also deteriorate and can have serious consequences. Water-based lube tends to be the least problematic, but do look into the pros and cons of each type of lube before you get some.</span></p>\n<p><b>DON’T kinkshame!!!!</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you partner asks you if you guys could try this out, don’t freak out and make them feel bad about themselves. I’m not saying you should do it if you don’t want to, but be understanding and calmly explain that you’re not interested. You don’t have to be a dickwad about it.</span></p>\n<p><em>Roxie Night wants you to be safe and open-minded when experimenting with new things.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/","id":6295,"author":{"id":644,"name":"Roxie Night"},"related":[6294,6293,6292],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
