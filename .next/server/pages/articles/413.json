Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A new era is set to begin for the UCSB women’s basketball team with newly instated Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson taking the reins heading into the 2015-16 season. Joining her will be two incoming freshmen, guard Caroline “Coco” Miller from JSerra Catholic High School and power forward Kali Jones from Vista Murrieta High, as well as a completely revamped assistant coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“The players have worked hard in workouts and have been welcoming as far as relationship building, and all of us have appreciated that,” Henrickson said. “Really excited about [the new staff] as well, the people that we’ve been able to bring here, their skill set and their energy.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson was announced as the team’s new head coach less than a month ago, replacing Carlene Mitchell after a four-year stint in which the Gauchos went 43-82 overall. After winning the Big West Championship back in 2011 and earning a spot in the NCAA Tournament in Mitchell’s first season with UCSB, the Gauchos’ record worsened each year. They most recently finished in last place in the conference with a mark of 2-27 overall, leading to the change which brought Henrickson to the team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The last thing I want them doing is thinking about December and January and February,” Henrickson said. “I think right now they need to focus on being better on the 21st of May than they were yesterday. As soon as you start looking ahead it can be overwhelming. We’ve just got to saw the wood, grind it out every day and try to get a little better.”</p>\n<p>Aiding Henrickson in bringing UCSB back to the top of the Big West will be the team’s only two additions on the court for next year in Miller and Jones.</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’10”, Coco Miller will be a player that UCSB can look to offensively to help improve the team’s poor shooting percentages from last year. In her junior year at JSerra Catholic, Miller averaged a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds per game, resulting in her being named First Team All-State and First Team All-CIF. By the end of just her junior year, she had already become the school’s all-time leading scorer with 1871 points.</p>\n<p>“There’s a need for us to be able to shoot the ball better from three,” Henrickson said. “That’s exactly what she does. The kid can shoot it. Tough kid, high basketball IQ and good energy.”</p>\n<p>Helping to fill the void left by graduated senior Clair Watkins on the inside will be Kali Jones. The 6’1” power forward is a versatile weapon in the paint who averaged 16.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and nearly three blocks per game in her junior year at Chaparral High. Jones transferred to Vista Murrieta High for her senior year with the hopes of improving her game further against a higher level of competition.</p>\n<p>“She’s played some really talented kids, that’s what she was looking for. I admire those reasons that she wanted to play there,” Henrickson said. “She’s long, she’s got some size, which we need. She’s a really driven, motivated kid.”</p>\n<p>Every player on the team this past season, excluding graduated seniors Clair Watkins and Kristine Brance, is set to return to the roster in the fall. With new leadership and a fresh start, UCSB will be taking a step-by-step approach as it looks to improve heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>“When you just talk about winning, there’s a lot of things you’re not having conversations about. It’s all about a process. The win is the result,” Henrickson said. “If you’re result-focused, you’re probably going to screw up the process. We will coach these young ladies up and help them get better every day.”<br>\nThe Gauchos will play their first game under Henrickson in early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/","id":413,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[412,411,410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Team Sends Four Players to SoCal Tournament at UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A week after competing in one of college tennis’ toughest tournaments, the ITA Regionals, Head Coach Marty Davis will send four players to UCLA for the 54th annual Southern California Intercollegiat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A week after competing in one of college tennis’ toughest tournaments, the ITA Regionals, Head Coach Marty Davis will send four players to UCLA for the 54th annual Southern California Intercollegiate Championship.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the oldest college tournaments on the West Coast,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “The list of past champions is quite impressive.

If they all do that they’ll get a chance to make the NCAA singles.”</p>\n<p>One Gaucho in particular will be looking to continue to build his name up on the national stage. Sophomore Ben Recknagel made it to the Round of 16 a week ago at the ITA Regionals, beating USC’s 90th-ranked Peter Lucassen, along the way. If he continues to play well against nationally ranked players, he will earn a ranking of his own and a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We know he’s going to play one of the [players who makes it past the qualifiers] on Thursday,” Davis said. “That’s always tough because they have already played a couple games. If he wins that he then has a rematch with Peter Lucassen, who he beat at Regionals. It’s a tough draw psychologically, but we’re looking for him to win this thing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the implications of the potential match, Recknagel is not concerned.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously going to be tougher to beat him a second time around,” Recknagel said. “He’s going to prepare for me differently now that he knows I’m good. I know how to play him so I just hope I can beat him again.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will consist of 32 players from schools including UCLA, USC, UCI, UCSB, Denver, Loyola Marymount, BYU and UCSD. USC’s Daniel Nguyen, the #1 seed and runner-up of the ITA Regionals, will also be participating. Sixteen players, including Recknagel and senior Alex Konigsfeldt, will automatically be accepted into the main draw, while the others, including senior Evan Jurgensen and junior Alexander Johnson, will play qualifying matches on Wednesday to determine if they will make the main draw.</p>\n<p>“The level of competitions in the qualifiers is going to be high,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a doubles bracket, Recknagel pairing up with Konigsfeldt and Johnson with Jurgensen. Doubles play was a weak point for the Gauchos in the ITA regionals, and they need to step up this week if they want to hold on to a chance to make the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to see somebody pop,” Davis said. “We’re going to continue to experiment with pairings and hopefully we’ll find somebody this week. We think that Alex and Evan could be a good pair.”</p>\n<p>This five-day tournament comes just a week after the grueling, six-day-long ITA Regionals, and some people might be worried that fatigue would be a problem for the Gauchos. However, neither Davis nor Recknagel are worried, and both are certain that it won’t be a problem.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody’s feeling a lot better,” Davis said. “The guys made it and survived midterms. I think we’ll feel a lot better psychologically this time.”</p>\n<p>The first matches for the Gauchos will be Jurgensen’s and Johnson’s qualifying matches Wednesday morning. Johnson will face UC Irvine’s Steven Henderson while Jurgensen faces Tyler Loong of BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/","id":410,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[409,408,407],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Newest Phenom: Gabe Vincent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/01.22.15-StephenManga-MBBall-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/01.22.15-StephenManga-MBBall-2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"How men's basketball star Gabe Vincent almost never came to UCSB and why he will be needed for the Gauchos to win the Big West.

UCSB would go on to win six of its next seven games after that to put the team where it is now, a half game behind UC Irvine for second place in league.</p>\n<p>In the postgame press conference afterward, he spoke with ease not seen in most 18-year-old freshmen that have just won the game for their team.

Becoming the first true freshman to start a season opener for UCSB since 2008, Vincent’s sharp shooting and all-around facets of his game have made him an instant-impact freshman on a team in position to win the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I can do a little bit of everything, but shooting is probably my best attribute,” Vincent said. “I try to facilitate, I try to do all those little things, so my game is pretty rounded, but it could definitely get better without a doubt.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58751\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1592021322\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61585\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58751\" data-attachment-id=\"58751\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/ucsbs-shooting-overwhelms-mustangs/cameryn-brockdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=1145%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1145,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3100\",\"caption\":\"(Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus)\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415608129\",\"copyright\":\"Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"(Cameryn Brock\\/Daily Nexus)\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"(Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=179%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?fit=733%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58751\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.23.2014-1175.jpg?resize=336%2C469\" alt=\"The son of two psychologists, Vincent did not begin to take basketball seriously until the sixth grade.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Vincent will need to get better when — not if — he becomes the best player on the team in the years to come. He’s only a few months removed from his senior year of high school, yet he plays like a senior with plenty of poise. He’s had to: to handle the pressure of making a game-winning shot, to have made his collegiate debut on the road against college basketball powerhouse Kansas, to start right away at the off-guard position on a team loaded with veterans.</p>\n<p>The youngest of three siblings, he grew up with parents that sometimes brought their work back home. Both his parents are psychologists, an experience Vincent described as “different”.</p>\n<p>“They’re in my head constantly without me even knowing it,” Vincent said. “… They know the answer before I can even answer it most of the times.”</p>\n<p>His parents had the right read on their son’s talent for basketball as well. Since he was in the sixth grade, Vincent began playing AAU ball, travelling to play in competitions.</p>\n<p>He split time playing for St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif. and the Oakland Soldiers on the AAU circuit. It was with the Soldiers that Vincent took the next step to improving his game, playing alongside another talented freshman this year, Arizona’s Stanley Johnson, and against players such as Duke’s Tyus Jones.</p>\n<p>Vincent’s place as the starting shooting guard was cemented before he even committed to Santa Barbara, according to Head Coach Bob Williams. He impressed the coaching staff that much. The problem was convincing him UCSB was the right place.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t really interested in Santa Barbara at first because I heard about the whole party scene,” Vincent said. “It didn’t seem businesslike at first.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were lobbying hard for him, he was wielding offers up and down the West Coast his junior year of high school. Offers from the University of Portland, Pacific and Utah State came in. In total, he was offered scholarships from 10 different schools, but not until he visited UCSB did his perspective on the campus change.</p>\n<p>“I just fell in love,” Vincent said. “As soon as I took my visit I said this is where I wanted to be.”</p>\n<p>With persistence from Assistant Coach Ryan Madry, Vincent signed in late September 2013 and proceeded to average 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.1 steals as a high school senior.</p>\n<p>Now with only Saturday’s game against Cal Poly left in the regular season, Vincent has for the most part shed the mistakes he was committing early in the season. What has helped his transition is how quickly he’s gelled with the team. In the season opener against Kansas in front of 16,300 screaming Jayhawks fans, it was just him and his teammates on the court.</p>\n<p>“I was still able to understand everyone on my team. It was almost as if I had been around them enough to that they were the only voices I heard,” Vincent said. “… The crowd just seemed like white noise.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60650\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1591443251\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61585\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60650\" data-attachment-id=\"60650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-09/late-run-gives-ucsb-thrilling-win-over-hawaii/the-gaucho-defense-holds-back-hawaii-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBball_vsHawaii-20150207-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"The Gaucho defense holds back Hawaii.

Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>This season has seen him demonstrate his future potential. Against No. 22 Southern Methodist University in Dec., he knocked down the game-tying three pointer that sent the game into overtime. His best game offensively came Wednesday night at Hawaii, where he scored a career-high 25 points on 8-13 shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>It is not surprising to hear how Vincent talks about his role as the team gets ready for the Big West Tournament next week. He knows the one-and-done nature of postseason play and realizes he needs be ready when the time comes.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing for something else, so it makes everything more important. It raises the stakes,” Vincent said. “I just think it’s import for everyone to embrace their role and not fight it.”</p>\n<p>So what keeps one of the frontrunners to the conference’s Freshman of the Year honor grounded? <em>Eyes to the sky</em>. That’s Vincent’s motto to remind him how he got here. He anticipates he might be the future of UCSB men’s basketball. Nonetheless, he remains even-keeled about the situation.</p>\n<p>“It’s the elephant in the room sometimes, but I try not to think about it too much,” he explained.</p>\n<p>For now, however, UCSB is more than satisfied with Vincent driving past defenders, setting his feet, snapping his wrist towards the basket, watching if the ball will go in. And Gabe always with his eyes to the sky.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of March 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Mark Salay is the sports editor for the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s.

As the team with the best record in the regular season, the Warriors are many peoples’ pick to win the NBA Championship this year and now they wait for the other series to finish up to find out who their next opponent is. Here are some thoughts from the series as well as what the Warriors have to do to keep the train rolling in the next round:</p>\n<p><b>The Warriors showed they could handle being down in games</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game two, the Pelicans took a 13 point lead in the first quarter, and with starters Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the bench, it was the 33 year-old veteran Leandro Barbosa with his 12 points in the game who led the charge to give the team a one point lead going into halftime. Thompson and Curry took over in the second half, with the Splash Brothers amounting for 48 points total.</p>\n<p>Game three saw the Warriors go down big again, this time needing a twenty-point comeback in the fourth quarter. Curry scored 40 points in the game including a ridiculous three-pointer in the final seconds of the game where he got trampled by two Pelicans’ defenders after he fired the shot. No foul was called on the play and the game went into overtime. The Warriors took control in the extra period and went on to win 124-119.</p>\n<p><b>The Splash Brothers are awesome, but don’t forget about Draymond Green</b></p>\n<p>MVP candidate Curry had a fantastic first-round series, averaging 33.7 points per game and Thompson was right behind him with 25 points per game. Both played huge roles and were able to take turns putting the team on their shoulders with the score close and the game on the line.</p>\n<p>With these two players sharing the limelight, it’s easy to look past how big of a role Green had in the series. Averaging 12.8 rebounds per game and 2.5 steals per game, Green played a tremendous role on the defensive front. He also added 15.8 points per game, showing off his size and strength at both ends of the floor. Expect Green to play a large role in the next round as he will be asked to defend the opposing team’s top player, as he did against New Orleans’ Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p><b>Game Plan For Next Series: Keep doing what’s been working</b></p>\n<p>The Warriors will be hunted by whichever team they end up playing. It’s their job to stick to their game plan from the rest of the season. If the Warriors pass and shoot the way they have been doing it all year, I can’t imagine any team being able to beat Golden State in the second round. The Warriors will be well rested and they will have veteran forward David Lee back from a lower back injury.</p>\n<p>Expect a lot of three-balls and for the Warriors to let Curry lead the way. He can dominate any team in the league with his shooting and when doubled teamed he always has an eye for an open teammate.</p>\n<p><b>Most likely second round opponent: San Antonio Spurs</b></p>\n<p>I expect the Warriors’ opponent to be the San Antonio Spurs, and Golden State will have to hope that their series with the Los Angeles Clippers goes the full seven games in order to make the winning team as tired as possible. While they have the advantage in experience, the Spurs are not as talented as they have been in past years and they aren’t getting any younger. The Warriors are too good to lose in the second round, but expect the series to be much more of a challenge than the first one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/","id":412,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[411,410,409],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
