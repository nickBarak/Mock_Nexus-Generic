The program’s goal is to attract diverse students of all areas of study. Students will graduate and work two to five years in their respective field and will return to UC Berkeley to complete their MBA. The Accelerated Access program estimates that it will enroll roughly 15 students a year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: Parent to plead guilty for involvement in admissions scandal at UCLA (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/29/parent-to-plead-guilty-for-involvement-in-admissions-scandal/\">Daily Bruin</a>)</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xiaoning Sui, a parent who allegedly paid William Singer — the ringleader of the college admissions scandal — in order for her son to be admitted to UC Los Angeles as a soccer recruit, accepted a plea deal on Wednesday and is expected to plead guilty to federal program robbery. Upon her arrest in September, Sui was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud. After receiving $400,000 from Sui, Singer then paid UCLA men’s soccer coach Jorge Salcedo $100,000 to list her son as a soccer recruit, who was later admitted to the school on an athletic scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: UCSC misses 2020 zero waste goal (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/24/ucsc-misses-2020-zero-waste-goal/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a shared goal throughout the UC system to recycle or compost 90% of all solid waste at each UC campus by 2020, UC Santa Cruz reported that it missed that goal by 40% this year, as the university managed to only divert just over half its solid waste by the beginning of the new year. However, no UC campus has achieved the goal, and UCSC cites budgetary shortfalls and shifts in the international recycling market as reasons for falling short. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: UCD is most sustainable university in U.S., third globally, according to GreenMetric Rankings (<em><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2020/01/24/uc-davis-continues-to-be-a-top-school-for-sustainability/\">The Aggie</a></em>)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis has been deemed the “most sustainable” university in the United States and the third most sustainable in the world for the third year in a row, according to the 10th annual GreenMetric Rankings. The UI GreenMetric World University Ranking takes into account setting and infrastructure, energy, climate change, waste, water, transportation, education and research when ranking institutions. The GreenMetric Rankings analyzed 799 universities around the world before determining the rankings. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/this-week-in-uc-news-1-23-1-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/this-week-in-uc-news-1-23-1-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/this-week-in-uc-news-1-23-1-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/this-week-in-uc-news-1-23-1-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/this-week-in-uc-news-1-23-1-29/","id":3465,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3464,3463,3462],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

After a brief introduction by the Fund for Santa Barbara Executive Director Geoff Green, attendees were split into three groups to discuss the most prominent self-governance models.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and pyschology double major Cameron Schunk and recent alumnus and former A.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the option to form a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/self-governance-in-isla-vista-an-uncertain-future/\">Community Services District</a> (CSD), which would absorb the I.V. Recreation and Park District and County Service Area No. 31 and provide a number of services potentially funded through a utility users tax. Meanwhile, I.V. Recreation and Park District Board (IVRPD) member Pegeen Soutar and IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould presented their proposal for a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC), in which I.V. representatives would either be elected or appointed in order to make recommendations to county administrators that would serve I.V.’s best intrests. Lastly, State Assemblymember Das Williams covered the options to incorporate I.V. as a city, have it annexed by another nearby city and any other recommendations.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, although additional taxes may not be popular with everyone, they are the only way to afford essential services.</p>\n<p>“I think we need a government structure that has ‘T’ a.k.a. taxes. I know ‘taxes’ is always a scary word in America, but taxes are the only way we can pay for things together. I can’t buy a sidewalk, but the CSD can buy a sidewalk for everybody,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, the CSD would be led by a board of directors voted in by residents of the district, with each member coming from a different area in order to adequately represent everyone. He explained that managing a small community requires the help of people whose priorities lie in Isla Vista with its needs in mind.</p>\n<p>“A government that has general scope can be where people go to get funding, to get collaboration, to get support and I think that’s going to be the big engine that will be a way for a local government structure to support what people are doing in Isla Vista,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Doreen Farr, Third District Supervisor of Isla Vista, Santa Ynez and Goleta, a major concern of I.V. citizens is its infrastructure and amenities.</p>\n<p>“I hear about streetlights, I hear about sidewalks, I hear about deteriorating living conditions, and I always report those to the County. A lot of times, both the families that live here and the students are vulnerable as renters,” Farr said. “Sometimes they’re afraid to report things and so their living conditions sometimes deteriorates even more. So, we’re trying to figure out a way to assist with that as well.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/ucsb-alumnus-among-the-first-to-hack-google-glass/\">Jay Freeman</a>, a local business owner, community organizer and alumnus of the College of Creative Studies also known by his pseudonym “Saurik,” agreed with Farr but said residents need to have the ability to affect the community on a policy level in order to make a positive difference.</p>\n<p>“A lot of these issues that were brought up at the beginning of the meeting, things like renting, leasing and property owners and issues like those, can only be fixed if we have the ability to change the rules and change the laws that we operate under,” Freeman said. “All these things require rule changes.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said with this in mind, a CSD or MAC would not go far enough in offering citizens administrative control, arguing that cityhood is the best option.</p>\n<p>“The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Melvin Singh, A.S. External Vice President of State Wide Affairs and political science and film and media studies double major, said more community involvement is needed before Isla Vista can change for the better.</p>\n<p>“I think the problem is that when something happens in I.V., a lot of students don’t show up to county meetings. We need to get a lot more student input on the major decisions that happened here,” Singh said. “The biggest thing is having stronger local lobbying.”</p>\n<p>Singh also said past failures to establish self-governance resulted from the fact that students live in a transitory phase in which they are short-term residents of Isla Vista, and thus lack the long-term commitment to improving the community.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why we haven’t really seen as much progress as I wish we could have, just because most of the people who live here only stay here for a few years and then move on,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>According to UC Police Department Lieutenant <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/question-authority-returns/\">Mark Signa</a>, despite the large range of differing opinions, the meeting was a success due to its display of increased involvement from residents.</p>\n<p>“What’s going on tonight is one of the benefits of having the community come together and realize that the problems of Isla Vista are just so vast and complex, and the community needs to come together and look at all the different options,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said that although the Town Hall was not a solution in itself, the tragic events that took place last year have instilled a greater need for local participation in repairing Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“What I see is a starting point,” Signa said. “We have a long ways to go, but I think it’s a great opportunity for the community to come together. Isla Vista needs that right now. After last year, we definitely need to come together as a community.”</p>\n<p>After the presentations concluded, attendees were asked to vote on their first and second choices for self-governance options, with the CSD gaining a heavy majority followed by the MAC.</p>\n<p>Although Williams spoke about cityhood and annexation, he said he personally preferred either the CSD or MAC option, but said which one does not matter provided it represents a large majority of what I.V. residents want. Singh said the first step to progress is convincing opposing sides to work together and recognize that Isla Vista needs a collaborative effort in creating self-governance.</p>\n<p>“Nobody really knows who’s supposed to be responsible for what,” Singh said. “Everyone has their own interest, and it’s about finding a common ground and agreement. I’m sure students want one thing and property owners want something else.”</p>\n<p>Signa said the community must come together to fix its wounds and agree upon a solution that will provide long-term improvements, not only in terms of funding and services but also by maintaining a healthy communication between various groups such as students and law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that the community come together and realize that those issues are here and we’ve got to come up with solutions that come from the community,” Signa said. “Law enforcement is just a band-aid.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-09/i-v-discusses-self-governance/","id":3462,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[3461,3460,3459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The committee has also held forums at UC Davis and UC Los Angeles, as well as meetings with UC union leaders and UC health officials. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, staff and faculty took to the floor to share the characteristics they are looking for in a president, along with policies they hope the new president will implement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next president needs to be an ally for immigrant students and underrepresented students of color,” Valerie Johnson, a representative from the UC Student Association, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students at the town hall were also vocal about their desires for the incoming president to focus on campus sustainability policies, including the possibility of creating a UC Green New Deal to address climate change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have an institutional responsibility to act collectively and use our resources to reduce harm and bring about sustainability and justice in our UC communities,” Sarah Bancroft, a third-year student at UC Berkeley, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley faculty and staff were also present to voice their concerns to the committee on a number of issues, including food insecurity, affordable housing and diversity and resource allocation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As staff, we’re really concerned about the issues of equity and inclusion that this new president would bring,” Brian Light, a delegate from Council of UC Staff Assemblies, said. “We’d love to see if a new president could champion some ideas to help the complexities that staff are increasingly seeing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berkeley faculty held their own town hall last November to discuss ideas to bring to the Special Committee. Michael Burawoy, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, reported that staff wanted a president who interacted more with students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to emphasize the importance of the new president understanding the actual campuses, and the relationships between the administration, the Senate faculty, lecturers, challenges graduate students face and the implications all this has for undergraduates,” Burawoy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the Special Committee will spend the next four months reviewing potential candidates and communicating with students and faculty from UC campuses.
