Though Bon Iver hinted at an inclination toward auto-tuned vocals and suggestions of computer-generated tunes in their sophomore, self-titled album, I’m not sure anyone expected such a jarring electro-folk hybrid in the band’s recently released third album, <em>22, A Million</em>.</p>\n<p>The first song, “22, (OVER S∞∞N),” resembles more of hodgepodge of eclectic sounds than an introductory track. There’s a recurring, single-note, synthy feedback noise, some melancholy-yet-jazzy sax and a healthy serving of interestingly affected voice samples. Though not necessarily unpleasant, it is clear from the strangely formatted title and arguably even stranger sounds that the band is trying to shock listeners. The band is possibly even trying to indoctrinate us into an almost experimentally electronic and noisy album, not for those who know the band only by “Skinny Love.” Though they’re listed nearly everywhere as an “indie folk” group, I’d describe this stage of Bon Iver’s career more along the lines of “if Phil Collins went in a really weird direction after leaving Genesis.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And, indeed, it does seem very ’80s-inspired, which is something a few fans will be expecting given the group’s prior work. This is not a decade that brings folk music to mind, but, as I’ve mentioned, neither is this album. Aside from retro bass and techno touches, the record is often reminiscent of EDM with its heavy doses of electric drums, static-y beats and what I call “bass farts.” A few times, I expected Kanye to jump in with a verse.</p>\n<p>Tracks like “715 – CRΣΣKS” and “29 #Strafford APTS” are more like the band’s well-known tunes in their almost gospel-like, building harmonies. Still, these vocals masquerade behind a proverbial shitload of Auto-Tune and are really just a chewed-up bone thrown to curmudgeonly fans like me who prefer the rainy-day vibes from old jams like “Holocene” and “Blood Bank.”</p>\n<p>Though the album is not particularly consistent with its two predecessors, it is consistent among itself. The music itself sounds interstitial, never quite resolved, while the lyrics reflect this with tales of waiting and searching. With autumn finally showing its colors (figuratively here in Santa Barbara), I was hoping for a more traditional set of songs from Bon Iver to listen to while wallowing in self-pity in the midst of midterms and romanticizing the fleeting rainy weather. That is not what I got, and, in all honesty, I will probably never listen to this album again. I encourage you to test the waters of this new style yourself, but if you need me, I’ll be listening to “Re: Stacks” on loop pretending <em>22, A Million </em>never happened.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72936\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"883125479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72936\" data-attachment-id=\"72936\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/solange_cover-1475240092-1000x1000/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"solange_cover-1475240092-1000×1000\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72936\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Saint / Columbia\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72936\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Saint / Columbia</p></div>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table</em> by Molly Guillermo</p>\n<p>Solange Knowles’s <em>A Seat at the Table </em>is a declarative demonstration of black excellence in music. The 21-track R&amp;B album, which Solange wrote, arranged and co-produced, is part memoir and part evaluation of racial politics in America, as well as a celebratory expression of black identity.</p>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table </em>contains remarkably smooth beats produced by Raphael Saadiq and spoken-word interludes performed by rapper Master P, but it also produces a strong thematic progression of Solange’s search for self-empowerment. The album celebrates blackness in a world that doesn’t always allow people of color the space to do so. The first track and first song written for the album, “Rise,” describes the healing process Knowles has been through in writing the album. Tracks such as “Weary,” “Cranes in the Sky” and “Mad” express the anger, grief and dissonance black women experience as a result of racism and prejudice. The burden of educating others is too often placed unfairly on people of color, who then find themselves tirelessly justifying their right to be angry. The R&amp;B singer criticizes the stereotype of the “angry black woman,” a term often used to invalidate women’s anger, in “Mad.” The track describes the songstress’s attempts to suppress her pain. In “Cranes in the Sky,” the singer grieves, “I tried to drink it away/I ran around in circles/but that just made me sadder.”</p>\n<p>The singer wrote on Instagram, “When I first started writing this record I was tired, filled with grief, and feeling broken … I wanted to tell my story, our story, in my own words, and in my own voice.” In “Don’t Touch My Hair,” Solange refuses to compromise her beliefs or her identity to satisfy others. She sets boundaries by telling white people who fetishize and alienate black women by non-consensually touching their hair to back off.</p>\n<p>The progression of the album continues. “Where do we go from here?” she asks in “Where Do We Go.” Master P answers this question in “Interlude: For Us By Us”: “If you don’t understand my record, you don’t understand me, so this is not for you.’” The interlude inspires Solange to begin to create a space for herself by allowing herself to rest. In “Borderline (An Ode to Self Care)”, she sings, “Baby, it’s war outside these walls/A safe place tonight/Let’s play it safe tonight.” Artists Nia Andrews and Kia Rowland go on to sing an acapella interlude, “I Got So Much Magic, You Can Have It,” that celebrates blackness. “Don’t let anybody steal your magic” is the defining rhetoric, both of this interlude and Solange’s journey.</p>\n<p>The album ends with a spoken-word interlude by Master P called “Closing: The Chosen Ones.” The final lyric, “Now, we come here as slaves, but we going out as royalty, and able to show that we are truly the chosen ones,” evokes regality. Solange has not only endured personal suffering, but identifies also with the suffering of all black people in America. At the conclusion of her journey, she recognizes herself and other people of color as the “chosen ones,” who deserve to be honored for their strength.</p>\n<p>Solange has created a beautiful and deeply personal album, rife with classic instrumentation and jazzy R&amp;B beats defined by her strong and clear voice. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is black excellence and black affirmation at its finest.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72937\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"193810748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72937\" data-attachment-id=\"72937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72937\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Warp\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Warp</p></div>\n<p><em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> by Ryan Hikes</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <em>Complex</em>, Danny Brown said that his artistic vision for his music is to “paint my own path and do something nobody else did because originality is everything to me.” Brown accomplishes this goal with his new full-length studio album <em>Atrocity Exhibition, </em>tackling the otherworldly, experimental beats all over this record that very few other rappers would even attempt to rap over.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, Brown returns to the more personal content of his breakout 2011 album <em>XXX</em> centered on his mental problems and drug use. However, <em>Atrocity Exhibition </em>does not simply celebrate drugs and partying, nor does it wholly condemn it. Instead, it portrays a person experiencing the highs and the lows of life. For example, the song “Get Hi,” which features a comedic hook by B-Real, seems at first to be an innocuous weed anthem. However, in the context of the album it amounts only to a temporary high, which may only lead to worsening depression akin to the “Downward Spiral” described in the first track. This song features unsettling guitars and industrial percussion that bring to life its hazy, eerie lyrics as Brown describes a depressive episode where he “feel like no one care, so I isolate myself and don’t go nowhere.” He then tries to quell this depression by “drowning [his] frustrations in an ocean of sin.” This is the tension of the album, as Brown seeks to relieve his pain, even though he knows it’s only pushing him further down this “Spiral.”</p>\n<p>This tension is realized in the instrumentals, as some of the best bangers of the year share a track list with some of the most soul-bearing raps since Kendrick Lamar’s <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. Incidentally, Kendrick features in one of the lead singles of the album, the posse cut “Really Doe,” along with Ab-Soul and Earl Sweatshirt. One of the highlights of the album, all four verses bring the energetic flow that makes a great posse cut, and it’s hard to pick a favorite feature, though Black Milk brings an excellent beat in his one production credit. Paul White, who is coming off a successful collaboration with Open Mike Eagle this year, remains on top of his game with a production credit on ten songs. A key standout from White is the sixth track, “Ain’t It Funny,” which features looping samples a muddy driving bass reminiscent of Grime music with high hornlike synths that create a creepy, funhouse beat. However, despite the exciting bangers of the album, the looming shadow of Brown’s depression remains in the background before being addressed with force on the final cut “Hell for It,” in which Brown reasserts control of his life by promising to keep fighting for his art despite his other problems. Ultimately, <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> does something quite remarkable among today’s hip-hop releases and remains cohesive in content, while tackling a variety of instrumentals that keep you interested throughout the 46-minute runtime of the record.</p>\n<p>Overall, this album is the perfect mix of unique artistry in the hip-hop medium: everything from the dark personal lyrics that present the highs and lows of a strained mental state to the eerie, experimental beats that seem to mesh perfectly with Brown’s unique yelping vocal delivery. <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> is the realization of Danny Brown’s desire to create something absolutely original and is one of the best hip-hop releases of the year.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72938\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2101037434\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72938\" data-attachment-id=\"72938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/banks/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Harvest\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harvest</p></div>\n<p><em>The Altar</em> by Malei Guzman</p>\n<p>Two years after the release of her debut album, singer-songwriter Jillian Rose Banks, better known as BANKS, released her sophomore album titled <em>The Altar.</em> The album was released at midnight on Sept. 30 2016. In this album BANKS experiments with her sound plenty, but also defines who she really is and who she wants to become as an artist.</p>\n<p>She starts the album off with an indie pop sound, and as it progresses it transitions into a much slower, alternative R&amp;B sound. The album touches many subjects, but the main theme that appears often is self-love and breakups.</p>\n<p>The song “To the Hilt” is a piano ballad about how hard it is to go through a breakup. It’s deep, it’s sad, it’s beautiful. Honestly,  listen to this song when you’re having feels.</p>\n<p>Her lead single, “Fuck with Myself,” is an anthem for everybody. It shows the beauty of loving yourself. BANKS herself has mentioned that this song can be interpreted in many ways. It has multiple meanings like, “I’m freaking awesome and I love myself,” or, “I don’t need anyone but myself!” It leaves one with the strong impression of, “I love myself because I am an awesome person, and if I’m the only one that can see that, it’s okay!”</p>\n<p>The song “Weaker Girl” also shows the strength within that comes with learning self-love. It’s a much slower song than “Fuck with Myself,” but it definitely shares the same message. The song explains the importance of loving yourself and surrounding yourself around people just like you. Being around people who share similar goals, interests and mindsets is a lot more important than one may think. The song is about a toxic relationship in which her boyfriend did not appreciate her for her greatness. He saw her as a toy; she was weak, and that gave him power. In the song she explains that she is not weak. She does not need someone who keeps brining her down; all she needs is herself and someone just as badass as her.</p>\n<p>In the song “Mother Earth,” we can hear the rawness of her voice. It’s soothing and it has a lot of true and powerful emotion to it. The song uses just a guitar for the instrumentals rather than her usual electronic, rap-inspired beats, which makes it great. We can hear her actual voice shine through, not one that is overpowered by the beat.</p>\n<p>Even though <em>The Altar</em> has a sound very similar to BANKS’s debut album <em>Goddess,</em> her sound on this album shows the improvement she has made with her voice. It shows how comfortable she has gotten over the years with her unique style of music.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/","id":6725,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6724,6723,6722],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy","biography":"Not available","articles":[6690,6725,6756,6909,6921,7566],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Neko Case Enchants Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-4.06.21-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-28-at-4.06.21-PM.png?resize=668%2C365&ssl=1","description":"There was something pure of the way Case poured her heart into her own words, making them echo against the walls of Campbell hall with intention.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Campbell hall filled with attendees, anticipation for Neko Case grew at the sight of the dim purple lights and the array of instruments on stage including everything from drums and guitars to keyboards and cellos. The audience, which was comprised by a majority of older adults and a few UCSB students, filled nearly every seat last Friday night at the venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the main performance, musicians Erica Bachmann and Jon Raunhouse set the tone of the evening with their quirky two-man folk performance. While the two are usually on scene as backup to Neko Case, it was a refreshing surprise for their sound to open as the forefront of the show. The night was kept at a casual pace set from the beginning</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they progressed through their set, songs seemed to tell a story or paint a picture to illustrate the mood in addition to feeling it. The ruminative quality of their sound was able to carry a brief escape from the trials and tribulations of reality. Scenes of an autumn day came to pass in songs like “Lilliwaup,” while “Asthmatic Gypsy” illustrated what a waltz in Paris may feel like; it was as if the audience was transported to the particular place in time being told. Lyrics in most of the performance were not necessary as the latitude of instruments effortlessly shifting from song to song by the artful and talented minds of the light-hearted artists was more than enough. My personal favorite, “Lupe’s Lament,” effectively showcased their repertoire of tunes that were both engaging and thoughtful.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Neko Case was introduced, the audience fell to an unnerving silence awaiting her start. Both Bauchmann and Raunhouse accompanied her on the stage, set to be her backing band among two other members of the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The singer-songwriter stole her audience’s breath with captivating instrumentals and lyrics, overwhelming the crowd with an array of feelings. The sweet, humorous singer opened with “The Pharaohs,” and proceeded to wow every single individual in the theater.  Neko Case can really sing. Her albums </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Worse Things get the Harder I Fight </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Middle Cyclone </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t do her voice as much justice as her live performance. The force of her words came from somewhere deep within her lungs and erupted in pitches that can only be described as a hurricane of force that still holds true to its graceful magic. I didn’t know it was possible for one voice to make a whole crowd feel connected in a range of emotions: from wholesome happiness to nostalgic sadness, all within its pitch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was love, there was sadness, there was an eeriness that brought about a haunting warmth. The humble artist not only charmed us with the highest and highs and lowest of lows, but let her own feelings guide her performance. It was obvious through her facial and body expressions, Case felt her songs on a deeper level as she sang them, showing that even the most talented are only human. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74462\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1690675448\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74461\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74462\" data-attachment-id=\"74462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-28/neko-case-enchants-campbell-hall/3531-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"306,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"3531-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74462\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of UCSB Arts and Lectures\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3531-1.jpg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of UCSB Arts and Lectures</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poetic lyrics such as “Brave to the waves of its residue/ Its laughter from a marbled room/ The white-crowned sounds of possible/ The sound that lures me/ It says, ‘Don’t you hurry/ Don’t you worry, kid,’ we’ll be seeing you/ We’ll see you when you’re ready” from “Ragtime” filled every space of the theater with powerful sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience was enthralled throughout; their content disposition was most evident in the soft whispering of lyrics to songs such as “This Tornado Loves You,” and an array of smiles, myself included, couldn’t be helped. The songwriter’s most popular song “I Wish I Was the Moon” stole the show, as many started applauding at the recognition of chords from the start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was something pure of the way Case poured her heart into her own words, making them echo against the walls of Campbell hall with intention. The country-folk-rock song writer appearing in casual, bare-faced winter attire looking ready to curl up next to a fire rather than perform. But this is a part of what makes Case so special. Her passion toward her music paired with an uncaring attitude to how she represents herself is exactly what draws the audience in closer, literally. Dramatic pauses followed by explosions in songs like “Bracing for Sunday” and “Look for Me (I’ll Be Around)” had her crowd on the edges of their seats, as the ringing of the last note hung in the air and the suspense of the next one to follow built up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between sets, conversation was kept to a minimum, but mentions of 2016 being a dark year led to a change in the pace with what Case calls her “most joyful song.” “Man,” the last song of her set, ended on a bright note that brought liveliness to the stage. Its freeing feel with sounds originating back to her older work graciously stole away the reality of now. While it may have been the last song, the audience cheered wildly, eager for an encore that was granted with “Middle Cyclone.” This was paired with side note summing up her performance nicely as songs that “make you laugh and punch you in the stomach at the same time,” before bowing and leaving the stage with a standing ovation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One student was heard yelling, “Hurry up before we miss Underbelly!” in a desperate attempt to get his slow friends to hustle. The energy was palpable Saturday night as students hurried to AS Program Board’s Welcome Back Concert, eager to dance up a sweat to the trap beats of EDM group Keys N Krates.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the show was UCSB’s own Underbelly. The hip-hop DJ, a student on campus, is a staple among local music. The opener has gained a following in the community both as a solo performer and as part of Azeem X Underbelly, a his collaboration with UCSB’s most famous flutist alumnus, Azeem Ward. (You can see their <em>Nexus</em> Batcave session here: <em>dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/azeem-x-underbelly-batcave-sessions-season-premiere/.</em>) The DJ did not disappoint, building up the crowd’s energy with his catchy beats and enthusiastic dance moves. His samples of hits, including Nicki Minaj’s “Feeling Myself” and “Bees in the Trap” had the audience singing right along with the recording, keeping the mood light and fun as students eagerly awaited the arrival of the night’s main act.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72684\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72684\" data-attachment-id=\"72684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/keys-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"keys-by-jenny-luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72684 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With Underbelly’s set coming to a close and setup beginning for the next set, echoes of “Nice to meet you!” and “Did you lose your friends, too?” floated through the crowd. More and more students — many of them brand new freshmen from the sounds of it — filled Storke Plaza. The Welcome Back Concert proved to be as much a social event as it was a live show, giving new and unfamiliar students a chance to get to know some of the names and faces that will be alongside them for the next four years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just as the crowd was getting antsy from waiting — idle chit-chat and nervous small talk fading into the background — a blaring boom from the speakers set the audience alight with cheers, signaling the entrance of the main act, trap trio Keys N Krates. The Toronto natives opened their set with infectious clapping beats that concertgoers — even if they ended up a little off rhythm — did their best to match.</p>\n<p>The trap group — consisting of keyboardist David Matisse, drummer Adam Tune and Jr. Flo on the turntables — made what could have been a lot of uncomfortable swaying and standing around a solid dance party. The crowd drew in close as the set got going, eager to get as close to the stage as possible. The performance was marked with hard-hitting beats and satisfying drops, practically daring the audience to find a way not to dance along. Playing a combination of original samples and well recognized tunes, the trio delivered with crowd favorites such as Travis Scott’s “Antidote” (played appropriately “at the night show”), as well as one of the group’s most popular original tracks, the guaranteed-to-get-stuck-in-your-head “Dum Dee Dum,” both of which garnered loud cheers and smooth moves from the crowd (as well as a, “Please tell me I didn’t miss ‘Dum Dee Dum’ ’cause that’s what I came to see!” from a girl standing nearby).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72685\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72685\" data-attachment-id=\"72685\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/beating-festival-fomo-8-new-events-selling-overpriced-day-passes/keys-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"keys-by-jenny-luo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72685 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Keys-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the set began winding down to a close, the crowd gradually thinned out with those remaining focusing less on recognizing familiar songs and more on finding a beat to dance to. Although the EDM group brought a fun experience, toward the end of the performance, the familiar pattern of claps and then drops grew repetitive, verging on losing the audience’s attention. The set could have used more variety in sound, but the trio gave students a night of upbeat music to socialize and dance along to.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to hear more from Keys N Krates, check out

most iconic anthems all eventually reach a point where a live performance is no longer possible. Perhaps that is what makes The Who at Santa Barbara Bowl such a special concert. The 51-year old English rock band comes to town Thursday night as a leg of what could very well be its final performance exhibition, titled, “Back to the Who Tour 51!”</p>\n<p>Any musical act that rocked the stage at Woodstock in 1969 is certainly worth witnessing live. A quick Google search of The Who’s “related artists” reveals a star-studded array, including The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, and just about any other 20th century powerhouse that will send your mom and dad’s nostalgia to the moon and back. With more than 100 million records sold worldwide, and hundreds of tribute bands attempting impersonations, The Who’s influence is undeniable.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s show will feature two of the original four members of the band, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. This is as authentic as a Who show can possibly get in 2016, as past members Keith Moon and John Entwistle are no longer living. As a lead singer, Daltrey has developed a famed reputation as one of rock’s most charismatic figures. Townshend has been cited as the driving force behind the songwriting successes of The Who, and is revered by other guitar gods such as Johnny Marr of The Smiths, who calls Townshend “the best of the ’60s guitar players by miles.” Both his master guitar playing and supporting vocals will be on display as he accompanies Daltrey’s frontman duties.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Some of The Who’s greatest hits include, “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” “My Generation” and “Baba O’Riley.” The first few bars of each of these songs will instantly send shockwaves of familiarity through your brain. Whether or not you recognize this music as The Who, you’ve undoubtedly heard at least one song from their repository of classics.</p>\n<p>In its prime, The Who’s influence was felt beyond music. The group’s adoption of the 1960s Modernism (“Mod”) aesthetic promoted London-based styles that infiltrated cultures around the world. The band also found itself at the epicenter of counter-culture influenced performance art, destroying instruments on stage in dramatic, theatrical fashion. The sheer possibility of a 71-year old Pete Townshend smashing a guitar against the Santa Barbara Bowl stage should be enough incentive for anyone to attend this show.</p>\n<p>So, whether or not you find yourself listening to The Who edition of “20th Century Masters: Greatest Hits,” the band’s mere presence in our city is worthy of note. With 50 plus years of experience under their belts, Daltrey and Townshend are sure to deliver a concert that will take a place in your memory for good.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72796\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72796\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/legendary-the-who-to-hit-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6724,"author":{"id":702,"name":"Benjamin Miller"},"related":[6723,6722,6721],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
