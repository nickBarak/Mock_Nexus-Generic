J. “Jake” Gittes (Nicholson) as he begins an investigation of Hollis I. Mulwray’s  (Darrell Zwerling) affair, only to find himself tangled in a murder and a scandal exploiting the land and water resources of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“Chinatown” features a multi-layered story with many twists and turns, but the reason why the surprise and suspense can catch viewers off guard is partly in thanks to the cinematography. The film frames several shots to fit Gittes’s perspective, like the scene where he tails Mulwray to a dry riverbed. As he holds a pair of binoculars to his eyes, the screen displays a double-circular frame with an out-of-focus black mask surrounding the edges to mimic that binocular experience.</p>\n<p>Other times, shots are taken from behind someone’s shoulder or with the object of interest seen afar to match Gittes’s point of view until the audience is granted a close-up. This offers so much intimacy to Gittes’s character that we are just as surprised as Gittes to hear the gunshots and just as shocked to see copious amounts of water released from the reservoir, despite the dry land. Even our own conclusions of the murder and scandal are constantly questioned until Gittes (as well as the audience) uncovers all the evidence to reveal the truth.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the screening, Pollock Theater Director Matt Ryan sat down with Film &amp; Media Studies Lecturer Anna Brusutti to discuss the story and inspiration behind “Chinatown,” as well as its relevance to the present. (Warning: discussion contains slight spoilers).</p>\n<p>The film is based on events that led to the California Water Wars, a series of disputes over water rights in Southern California in the 20th century. In order to resolve its water shortage in the late 1800s, Los Angeles constructed an aqueduct that flowed from the Owens Valley. But by the 1920s, the valley saw much devastation to its ecosystem and agriculture as the aqueduct redirected water from the Owens River to the city. Though farmers tried to destroy the aqueduct, L.A. prevailed and, by 1962, the Owens Lake at the bottom of the valley completely dried.</p>\n<p>“[The Owens Valley] was considered the Switzerland of California,” Brusutti said. “And now, of course, it’s still resenting dramatically after 100 years, still a barren landscape without water.”</p>\n<p>William Mulholland, head of a predecessor department to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, oversaw the aqueduct construction and also inspired the character of Mulwray who, in the film, is a chief engineer for the same division. Though Mulwray provides the catalyst for Gittes’s investigation, he also instigates the water motif throughout the film. Water surrounds him: Water drips from his surveillance photos, water directs his job, water causes his death and even the lack of it prompts his concern.</p>\n<p>“[Water] is the source of life and, of course, the place in which people die,” Brusutti said. “Because basically taking away water from the Owens Valley actually did cause the death of an entire ecosystem … Water kills and water gives life. And somebody’s going to exploit it, and that exploitation is going to mortgage the future.”</p>\n<p>And mortgage the future it did. Going back in time, Ryan explained, 15 percent of the country was privately owned with 33 percent higher rates for water.</p>\n<p>“Wait, no, I’m sorry. Those stats are wrong; those are today’s,” Ryan said. “So clearly it’s not changed for the better. It’s actually skyrocketing with more privation of water.”</p>\n<p>Which begs the question posed in an <em>L.A. Times</em> editorial about a month ago: “What is water?”</p>\n<p>“Is it a resource,” Brusutti asked, “a commodity, a government service or a human right?”</p>\n<p>It’s a question addressed in the 1974 neo-noir film, and 40 years later, we’re still asking.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/what-is-water-a-review-and-discussion-of-chinatown-1974/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/what-is-water-a-review-and-discussion-of-chinatown-1974/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/what-is-water-a-review-and-discussion-of-chinatown-1974/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/what-is-water-a-review-and-discussion-of-chinatown-1974/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/what-is-water-a-review-and-discussion-of-chinatown-1974/","id":5952,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[5951,5950,5949],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Bitcoin: All That Glitters Isn’t Always Gold","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoinart.jpg?resize=209%2C209&ssl=1","description":"On Monday, I accidentally showed up around thirty minutes early to my 12:30 p.m. history class.

The time was just short enough to force me to stay in Phelps Hall, but not long enough to do anything. So I decided to do the usual and crack out my laptop to browse Facebook and Reddit.</p>\n<p>It was pretty much the usual. Friends uploading new pictures, lame memes reposted from Reddit and chuckles about North Korea’s bullshit, but something caught my eye. A thread on /r/economics mentioned Bitcoin, a new all-digital currency championed by libertarians and Tea Partiers as being the digital alternative to the gold standard. This wasn’t the first time I had heard about it — back in February, my friend tried to get me to buy into it when it was still around $2 per digital coin. I didn’t. I thought it was a bubble then, and I know it’s a bubble now. But curiosity got the best of me, and I just had to check the exchange rate to see if I was right.</p>\n<p>“Holy fucking shit!” I nearly jumped out of my seat. I was right, but inconveniently so. Back in February, my friend had tried to suggest that I invest around $500 to buy around 250 in shares, priced at $2. Had I done that, I would now be sitting on 250 shares of Bitcoin now valued at $236, or around $59,000 in estimated worth. “Holy fucking shit” is right.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Back to Facebook, my friend’s News Feed lit up like the Fourth of July, proclaiming the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, and heralding it as the future of digital currency. My cries of warning and temperance went unheeded as he gleefully listed off the soaring price. $175. $185. $231!</p>\n<p>The reason why it was so high was because it was a speculative bubble. Bitcoin was marketed as an alternative to the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro, as being a hard currency that can be used to barter for goods. The advantage is that it is completely free from any central banking monetary policy, so it can increase and decrease at will. This makes it the world’s first universal investing currency to avoid the drags and pitfalls of inflationary and deflationary cycles brought upon by fluctuations in the money supply. Or at least that’s what Bitcoin would have you believe.</p>\n<p>In the opinion of this writer, it’s just a hoax, and I’m not in bad company. Jim Cramer of “Mad Money,” financial analyst Felix Salmon and even Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman had less than stellar things to say about Bitcoin, with Cramer even rejecting it as a currency at all.</p>\n<p>To even be considered a currency, Bitcoin would have had to have been accepted as a medium of exchange, but barring a few examples, virtually no one has done so. Instead, it was quite rapidly identified as a potential bubble by market speculators. They simply wanted to buy enough shares at a low enough price, hoping that some poor sap would buy a few several months down the road at a grossly inflated price. Think of it like buying tickets to the ball game playoffs before the season starts. If your team makes it to the playoffs, you can sell the tickets for a handsome profit. If they don’t, then you’re shit out of luck, unless you can offload it to some poor sap before that. And that’s exactly what’s happening to Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The value of Bitcoin peaked last night at around $260 before falling to $105. In a move that is echoing the housing bubble of 2007-2008, it is slowly climbing back up again, as the “true believers” are in complete denial of Bitcoin’s impending doom. On Reddit’s /r/Bitcoin subreddit, there’s a thread with 755 upvotes titled “Hold Spartans!” with a link to a Photoshopped image of Spartan phalangites sporting Bitcoin shields.</p>\n<p>Back to Facebook, I replied about an hour ago to my friend’s thread. He responded, “Crashed??? Time to buy, buy, buy!” “No… dude,” I chimed back in, “We’re at the first bull trap, and you’re in denial. Sell now, recoup your principle, or get wiped out.” But before I could finish, he replied, “It’s just a bump, not a crash.”</p>\n<p>I doubt that. But it hasn’t stopped people dumping tons of cash into the market, with some even selling their houses to get the requisite cash to invest.

Womyn’s Commission, A.S. Queer Commission, End Fake Clinics, Take Back the Night, Voices for Planned Parenthood and The Women, Gender, and Sexual Equity Department, are extremely frustrated and disappointed with your decision on April 22, to not endorse the proposed fee increase for The Women, Gender, and Sexual Equity Department. In your reasoning you explained that a fee increase from $4.25 to $8.17 per student, per quarter, seemed “extraneous” and that the current fee “already provides adequate funding.” Furthermore you claimed that, “increasing student employment, expanding community outreach programs and maintaining up-to-date libraries and lounge areas do not seem like the best use for student funds,” and added, “especially in light of recent tuition increases and student budget constraints.” It is our view that student employment, community outreach, libraries and spaces to study and feel safe, are indeed crucially important especially in times when other services and opportunities are being reduced. Therefore, allow us to explain to you, in more depth than your journalists were capable of, the importance of the WGSE department, the organizations that cooperate with and rely on the WGSE department, and most importantly the necessity of these spaces in the UCSB and Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>First let’s begin by addressing what exactly the WGSE department offers to this campus. Aside from a library and conference room available for student organizations, that you made sure to highlight on both articles printed on April 17 and April 22, the WGSE department does much more with its far from “adequate” funding. They are responsible for CARE (Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education); Sexual Harassment Prevention Education Program; the Non-Traditional Student Resource Center; the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity; quarterly program offerings and support groups. In other words, a SAFE SPACE. Moreover, they work with many organizations on campus such as: PAVE, Men Against Rape, A.S. Womyn’s Commission, Take Back the Night, VOX- Voices for Planned Parenthood, Women’s Ensemble Theater Troupe, Women in Science and Engineering, Student Veterans Organization, Queer Student Union and A.S. Queer Commission. WGSE provides safe spaces and advocacy for survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking. They also provide LGBTQIA resources as well as resources for non-traditional students (student parents, veterans). Additionally, WGSE is adding a new advocacy fund. In the past, survivors would have to pay for protective orders and other fees on their own, and this new advocacy fund would allow WGSE to help pay for those costs. The WGSE department is essential to these groups and individuals for funding, support and advocacy.</p>\n<p>Your refusal to endorse a fee increase that is much needed and you labeled as “extraneous,” was particularly outrageous considering the community WGSE serves. Knowing the high prevalence of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, hate crimes, homophobia, gender discrimination, among other issues that occur on this campus and in Isla Vista, common sense dictates anyone to think critically about this center and what it offers to this campus. Your decision against this fee is emblematic of how disregarded these, unfortunately very common, issues are at UCSB. We invite you to step into the WGSE center, where increased funds are a necessity, to educate your paper and properly research everything that the center has to offer. We recognize your influence on this campus and urge you to use it responsibly; do not belittle safe spaces as a luxury, strive for more than “adequacy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>The above letter was written collaboratively by: A.S.

Holy motherfreakin’ crap.</p>\n<p>The thing about car chases is that they’re a common staple of action movies and it’s very difficult to make them seem fresh and new. George Miller’s fourth “Mad Max” movie doesn’t only breathe new life back into this common trope — it forces an air hose into its mouth and nose, turns up the air to 11 and screams in its face. The movie is insanity, although many are comparing it to a B-movie, which is certainly understandable. It’s very unlikely that people would look, act and dress like this movie’s characters in an actual post-apocalyptic world, but, then again, the post-apocalypse would be downright boring otherwise.</p>\n<p>Like its famed predecessor, “The Road Warrior,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” is set in a post-apocalyptic Australia, where roving gangs of insane bandits terrorize the outback and tend to follow large, masked warlords. This time, though, former cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) plays second fiddle to Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a high-ranking goon of Darth Vader-wannabe Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, the original “Mad Max” villain, Toecutter). When Furiosa takes Joe’s “wives,” five women who are used as breeding stock in the hopes of reaching a safe haven, he takes off in pursuit with an entire armada of mutant death-mobiles at his back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The reason why this movie has received acclaim from both critics and diehard “Mad Max” fans is that it’s a return to the good ol’ action formula. Virtually everything that happens on screen is real; the only thing in the film that is very obviously computer-generated is the gargantuan, tornado-spewing haboob that Furiosa drives into. Real cars flip in midair and explode, half-naked men in masks hang precariously from tilting poles attached to their vehicles and ghillie-suit-wearing motorcyclists throw firebombs while flying in midair. It’s an orgy of clashing metal and bullets that absolutely oozes badassery. Anyone who plans to watch this online: first of all, that’s illegal, you naughty thing. Secondly, you’d be doing yourself a massive disservice to not see this on a big screen with surround sound.</p>\n<p>But one does not simply review this movie without praising Furiosa. First of all, what an amazing name, just say it out loud: Imperator Furiosa. Wooh. Love it. Deadly both behind and off the wheel of her massive War Rig, Furiosa is the standout character, a woman trying to find redemption for her past sins and kicking an immeasurable amount of ass along the way, too. Theron perfectly pulled off the grit required by such a character. Many are calling her the next Amanda Ripley, and I can definitely see that. Now we all just have to hope this movie is just as, if not more popular than, “Aliens.”</p>\n<p>There has also been some debate about whether or not “Fury Road” is a feminist movie. That label may mean different things to people (especially to an online group of hilariously paranoid men’s rights “activists” who are calling for this movie to be boycotted), but I can reassure everyone that the female characters in the movie are all well-written. Some may think this is irrelevant in this day and age, but after watching a particular scene from “Age of Ultron” with Black Widow that made me want to bang my head against a wall, I am hopeful that “Fury Road” is a sign that male writers are taking more care in portraying women in film. We need more rifle-wielding biker-grannies anyways.</p>\n<p>If this review hasn’t convinced you of how pants-wettingly awesome this movie is, query me this: Why on Earth would you not want to watch a movie where there’s a masked man rocking out on a fire-spitting electric guitar while strapped to a moving wall of speakers?</p>\n<p><em>Bear in mind, Alex Wehrung is not easily impressed. </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63695\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/mad-max-burning-man-meets-the-blues-brothers-in-fury-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63695\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/mad-max-burning-man-meets-the-blues-brothers-in-fury-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/mad-max-burning-man-meets-the-blues-brothers-in-fury-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/mad-max-burning-man-meets-the-blues-brothers-in-fury-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/mad-max-burning-man-meets-the-blues-brothers-in-fury-road/","id":5951,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5950,5949,5948],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
