Dead Week. Finals. The time when your textbooks come in handy more than ever (because, let’s face it, many of us have chosen to “postpone” the hundreds of pages of joyous learning).</p>\n<p>No one here doubts the worth of textbooks — they are an asset to professors and often (but not always) maximize our learning. My fellow Gauchos, perhaps the most frustrating feeling of the quarter faces us when the investment we made on a book in the beginning of the class is essentially devalued in front of our faces.</p>\n<p>Wasn’t this required only days ago? Why, now that the quarter has ended, is the book you purchased for $80 now worth no more than $20? Or, even worse, the textbook is no longer being used for the next quarter and is therefore worth nothing. Pardon my naiveté, but how can an $80 book lose its entire value overnight? Is it that crucial to purchase the new textbook version for the “updated” index or table of contents and to enjoy the flashy new cover? Even if you believe those additions are worth the extra cost, I think I can safely say there is a consensus among college students that the textbook industry has been draining our wallets over the years by selling overpriced textbooks and then refusing to buy them back at a fair price.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A group of students from the Political Science Dept. decided to tackle the issue of overpriced textbook costs at UCSB and come up with some answers. After some research, we stumbled upon a CalPIRG survey which found that students nationwide spend an average of $900 per year on textbooks. This is almost the equivalent to 20 percent of tuition fees at an average public university and half of tuition fees at a community college. After running our own survey and calculating the 100 responses, we obtained similarly alarming statistics. Our results show that 44 percent of students spent between $600 and $900 a year on textbooks, while 13 percent actually did spend over $900 over the course of the year. The survey also indicated that about 42 percent had not bought the required textbook once or more per quarter because of the cost. There was one encouraging result however — that 80 percent of students had professors who sometimes or often put textbooks “on reserve” (only 3 percent did not know what “on reserve” meant).</p>\n<p>“On reserve” means the professor provides the UCSB library front desk with the required book and allows it to be loaned out for two hours at a time (or overnight, if you check it out just before the reserve desk closes). Not surprisingly, there are students who would find this a hassle. However, putting books on reserve is a practical and crucial alternative for low-income students who have no other option. About 40 percent of our respondents said they were interested in utilizing the service, and 32 percent said they already use books on reserve.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these statistics are not alarming for some of you. We are not suggesting that everyone should start sending hate mail to greedy publishing companies that charge the outrageous prices to begin with (although it would be nice if you did). Ultimately, we are hoping to inform students and professors of the seriousness of the situation and offer possible alternatives. The economic crisis and the fee hikes are no secret. Outrageous rent, increasing tuition, food and other basic needs have forced some students to make the ultimate sacrifice — textbooks and, thus, their education — in order to get by.</p>\n<p>While many professors have indeed worked very hard to accommodate students and offer online copies or other alternatives, the financial stress on students seems to be lost on some professors who refuse to compromise with the very students they are charged with educating. We have therefore proposed an online pledge for professors to put at least one copy of the required textbooks on reserve, suggesting the ideal goal of one book per 50 students in large classes. Some professors have already signed and others have provided useful feedback. Opening the dialogue between students and professors is the first step in finding an agreeable solution for all parties (except the greedy publishers of course).</p>\n<p>Another resource that will be available to UCSB students in the near future is something you probably haven’t heard of yet, but should keep in mind for next year! Sponsored by Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee, the “Book Bank” will help alleviate the financial pressure on students. The Book Bank will be an alternative library for students to check out books they may require for their courses. SIRRC will provide donation boxes in residence halls and other locations such as the Annex building where the SIRRC office is located.</p>\n<p>If you’re left feeling betrayed when you sell your pricey book back for chump change, consider donating to the Book Bank instead! Maybe you would feel better about getting that book off your hands if you knew that instead of going back into the for-profit system, it would go to a student in need. Not only would this make you feel good, but if the time comes when you need to check out a book from the Book Bank, it will be more likely to be there.</p>\n<p>So think wisely, Gauchos, and remember that a united voice from the students is our best chance of success in dealing with overpriced textbooks!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/putting-textbook-takeover-wallet/","id":6166,"author":{"id":595,"name":"Onofre Echeverria"},"related":[6165,6164,6163],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":595,"name":"Onofre Echeverria","biography":"Not available","articles":[6166,6168],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Proactive Chilean Students Create a Model for Californians","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"American newspapers consistently portray the student protests in Chile as negative.

A recent article in The Daily Californian (“UC students abroad notice the impact of recent unrest,” Aug. 17, 2011) included the following comments from Berkeley student Bonnie Tung: “We would go to class, and there would be no class,” and “Some of us live in downtown (Santiago) and have had to stay at friends’ places to avoid the tear gas in that area.”</p>\n<p>As an exchange student from UCSB in my second semester at a public university in Santiago, I view this as a wonderful and unique educational opportunity. Isn’t that the most important part of studying abroad — to experience a foreign culture? Otherwise, why not stay in the comfort zone of Santa Barbara, Davis or Berkeley? It is without doubt a historic time in Chilean history, and I am overjoyed to be lucky enough to witness it firsthand. I have been fortunate to learn more outside the classroom in Santiago than inside. Every Chilean — student, parent, professor or average citizen — is current on the student protests, whether they are in accordance with them or not. They give you a history lesson beginning with the pre-Pinochet era up to the present to explain the value Chileans have for democracy. They are an incredibly informed public, far more than the majority of Americans. Even sadder, the average Chilean probably knows more about American politics than half of the American public.</p>\n<p>The complaints printed in the The Daily Cal article are not even accurate. I know I can speak for most of the “viejos” (year-long EAP Chile students in our second semester) who were around when the strikes started, when I say that there was definitely an adjustment period, but we have now come to accept it. Oh, those Chileans! While studying in a foreign place, you will be adjusting and adapting daily to the new culture around you. This is just one more adjustment that comes with the territory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is it possible to study abroad in Santiago? Absolutely. Even though the Chilean students are on strike, foreign students still have an obligation to go to class, as do the professors, who are not officially on strike. The majority of the faculty is still holding classes specifically for exchange students. While there definitely were — and still are — nuisances in trying to arrange semester schedules, the directors of EAP Chile and the international relations offices at the universities here are working diligently to ensure that everyone has enough credits and classes to meet their educational goals. They have added the option of research or special studies projects working with a Chilean professor to make up for classes that may have been cancelled.</p>\n<p>And, compared to California, the class size can’t be beat. When was the last time all your classes contained just two to five students? We get to know our professors on a personal level and have more flexibility in the class. Open discussion is the norm, rather than lectures, making classes more interesting and creating an affable and supportive environment for those still learning to speak Spanish. I have really come to greatly appreciate these intimate seminars.</p>\n<p>UC students could learn a lesson from the Chilean youth. UC tuition has risen more than 40 percent in the last three years. When I started college in Fall 2008, tuition averaged about $7126/year. According to UCLA’s Financial Aid Dept., it now costs $12,685 per year for in-state tuition for a public university. What happened to affordable education for everyone? Our public education system has tanked, just like Chile. Due to budget cuts, classes are being cancelled, majors and minors are being dropped and crashing over-enrolled classes is now a way of life for most UC students.</p>\n<p>But the difference is that they are actually doing something about it. The student demonstrations continue to be all about providing an affordable (or free) quality education for every Chilean. So rather than complain about the annoyances caused by the protests, take advantage of this monumental time in Chilean history and live it! Take the inconveniences with a grain of salt.  Spend your time observing how students can democratically make a difference in improving the educational system that is letting them down.

Its cavernous interior is modeled to look like a night time Spanish village, which certainly lends the place a lot of atmosphere. The rest of the theatre is clean, ornate and best of all, isn’t more expensive than any other movie theater.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Not exactly the place to watch a serious drama in. I saw “Spotlight” here, and the theatre echoed from the booming speakers and lack of audience. Definitely only come here for a blockbuster. “Ready Player One” definitely suited the place a lot better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Buchanan Hall</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go right outside to get dinner from the snack shack.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Everything else. Film students and professors alike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loathe </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buchanan Hall. If the picture doesn’t fail, the sound does. The temperature always seems to be off. You need to slump in your seat to see the undersized, dirty screens. Seeing the original cut of “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in that place was truly painful. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Camino Real Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The proximity. It’s one bus ride away, and a short walk if you live around FT. The tickets are $7 on Tuesdays and there are some arcade games if you feel so inclined. The interior is very welcoming and if you need to eat afterwards, there’s a bunch of restaurants outside you can fill your belly at. I recommend the Kahuna Burger joint, if you’re feeling particularly referential.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The clientele. Generally, I’ve found that the more convenient a theater is to get to, the ruder the audience is. I had to ask a chattering couple sitting right behind me during “Infinity War” to be quiet. The boyfriend promptly told me to suck his dick and the girlfriend kept going “Sheeit!” in what sounded like a heavy Russian accent every time something happened for the next two hours.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Plaza del Oro Twin</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you’re looking for a film in limited release in Goleta, like “Brooklyn” (the only movie I ever saw there), this charming little twin theater is the place for you. It’s also right by a cafe if you’re feeling tired or hungry.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: No car? Expect to take the 11 and have to walk.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Goleta Drive-In</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The traditional passion pit experience: screenings in the dead of night in the privacy of your own car, complete with hot dogs. They even have old-as-dirt arcade games at the snack shack—the kinds you saw during commercial for Chuck-E-Cheese’s when you were in elementary school.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Leaving your car running to use the radio to hear the movie runs the risk of killing your battery.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Pollock Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go see movies on the cheap that might not even be out in theaters yet, and see their cast and crew talk about them! One treasured memory of mine is seeing Steven Spielberg’s “1941” and hear one of the writers diss it. The audience is generally comprised of film students and old people, so it’s usually pretty quiet.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Food is restricted to the lobby.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Riviera Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I have two words for you: Dolby Atmos. Candy for the ears, ambrosia for your temporal lobes. When I went to see “Blade Runner: 2049” here, the audience was told how an audio engineer who had seen the movie 37 times said that the sonic experience at the Riviera was the best he had had yet. And how. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theater also prides itself on showing movies that fall well outside the mainstream, such as “The King’s Choice” and Cannes darling “The Square.” So if you want to see a film that will redefine how you listen to movies, this is the place to go.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Unless you have a car, this theater is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out-of-the-way. It’s a 20 minute hike from State Street (which is pretty much how I got most of my exercise for Fall Quarter), and even though it has this amazing sound system, don’t expect to see it paired with many blockbusters, if any. Even the Atmos can be a crux — watching “Mother!” with it was the most viscerally unpleasant experience I’ve had at the movies. Also, the snacks are few and abhorrently expensive.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I.V. Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are two programs here: Free Tuesday films and Magic Lantern. The former is just how it sounds and Magic Lantern provides $4 movies on Mondays and Fridays. Occasionally, you may even catch a marathon of “Harry Potter” and “The Lord of the Rings.” Sneaking in outside food and beverages is encouraged and you can occasionally win a poster from trivia competitions. Also, if you’re a film buff, you can always talk to DJ Palladino and his students in the lobby.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If students aren’t talking behind you, they’re checking their text messages or Snapchatting scenes from the movie in front of you. On rare occasion, drunk homeless men wander in and start shouting at the screen and dropping bottles all over the place, although security will quickly remove them. The men’s bathroom is gnarly and the urinal laughs at anyone below six feet. Only one of the water fountains work.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that’s it. That’s my guide. But before I go, let me leave off with some other general movie advice. Or rather, a plea. Because this stuff bugs me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t sneak snacks and drinks into the theater. Movie theaters get most of their money from concessions, since movie studios take most of the ticket sales. Don’t leave your trash around for the staff to pick up. Don’t send Instagrams or Snapchats or whatnot of whatever movie you’re watching and shine your phone’s light at the person sitting behind you. And for the love of god, stop exclaiming, “Oh shit!” every time something happens that surprises you. You’re in a public theater, not your living room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, I’m clocking out. Bye now.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/","id":6164,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6163,6162,6161],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wise Society Seeks to Mitigate Harm, Maximize Benefits","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Dennis Wassem’s opinion piece  “Governmental Taxation Undermines Its own Aims” in the Sept. 27, 2011 edition of the Nexus attacked the “narrow worldview” of the “disposition and abilities...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Dennis Wassem’s opinion piece  “Governmental Taxation Undermines Its own Aims” in the Sept. 27, 2011 edition of the Nexus attacked the “narrow worldview” of the “disposition and abilities” of government that was recently advanced by Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren. The article lays two charges against Warren’s argument for more social spending: that the government is not always benevolent and that privatizing public infrastructure and civil institutions maximizes their efficiency.</p>\n<p>The first contention is true but nonetheless a non sequitur. It is uncontestable that the federal government routinely and savagely tortures people, for example. However, criticism of government malfeasance does not imply that it should be inactive. The War on Terror is no excuse to end Medicare. Instead, a wise society seeks to mitigate the harms associated with the government while maximizing the benefits.</p>\n<p>The article’s second argument does directly address Warren’s message and rests on an economic assumption that would have Adam Smith spinning in his grave. It maintains that any service or product that is provided by the government can be more efficiently provided by a private entity. It supports this idea with a sloppy outline of the free market principles found in The Wealth of Nations. Unfortunately, this classic dropped off best sellers lists long ago and very few people actually read it. Many key points are forgotten and neglected when it is applied in modern contexts. Most importantly, Smith argues that decentralization of market power maximizes market efficiency — insulation from government influence is a means to that end, not the goal itself. A free market is not guaranteed by an absence of government regulation but rather by the diffusion of production and consumption over many competing and independent parties. The more complete this diffusion, the closer the market approaches the behavior of Smith’s free markets.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Tuesday’s opinion piece notes, private grade schools and high schools are often higher quality and more efficient than publicly-run equivalents; however, it neglects to mention that for-profit universities charge Ivy League rates for worthless degrees. The deciding difference between these two private education systems, according to Smith’s arguments, is that the former is often administered by small organizations while the latter is controlled by corporate titans. Another open secret in The Wealth of Nations is that Smith does not claim that private profit is always the best way to support the public good. Rather, he maintains that the government should administer such projects that cannot yield profit to any “small number of individuals” but “more than repay it to a great society.” He cites as examples services such as fire fighters and education and infrastructure projects like roads and bridges.</p>\n<p>The truth is that Smith was no ideological zealot though his intellectual corpus is often abused for such zealotry. The modern global economic environment scarcely resembles that of the 18th century and his arguments are often fallaciously extrapolated to support ideas that he vigorously opposed. Smith’s opposition to the concentration of economic power has been cast down the memory hole with the rise of the neoliberal economic order which he surely would have attacked as thinly</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-30/wise-society-seeks-mitigate-harm-maximize-benefits/","id":6165,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6164,6163,6162],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
