Yet the manifestation of this is so vastly different between the groups it’s almost jarring to see them on the same bill. The Glitch Mob is all aggressive machinery — a visual aesthetic borrowed from the film Blade Runner and the Fallout series of games, a musical aesthetic borrowed from Metallica. In contrast, Chromeo’s ’80s nostalgia synth-pop is all danceable grooves and lover boy sentimentality — an aesthetic much more human than machine. Yet somehow they complimented each other well, and along with supporting act Com Truise, delivered a fun and funky evening this Saturday at the Bowl.</p>\n<p>It was still sunny and warm for Com Truise’s opening set at 6:30. Dressed in black with his signature combination of tightly cropped hair and full beard, the producer deployed groovy computer pop confections for the still meager crowd. Though most of the audience early enough for his set seemed more interested in securing good spots for the following acts, Com Truise delivered a sonically delightful performance.</p>\n<p>Bass-y rumbles began to emanate from the stage almost as soon as the New Jersey-based producer walked off it. The atmospheric sounds built and layered upon each other as Com Truise’s equipment was removed to reveal a large, mysterious structure covered in a black sheet. As the noise reached a crescendo, the sheet was dramatically thrown off to release a cloud of smoke and reveal “The Blade” — The Glitch Mob’s “interactive instrument and art installation.” The Blade features three stations outfitted with MIDI controls and iPads, as well as machine-like “drums” to the rear. These allow the Mob to actually <em>play</em> their music live and switch roles and instruments mid-song.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen The Glitch Mob five times, and every single time, they have a totally different set-up,” Don Lucas, a UCSB alumnus attending the show, said. “That’s one of the reasons I love seeing them. And what they’ve got now, with The Blade, it’s completely unique. No one else has something like that.”</p>\n<p>Glitch Mob members edIT, Ooah and Boreta opened with their instantly recognizable “Mind of a Beast.” Behind them, a large screen displayed visuals choreographed to match each song. The Bowl’s extensive light set up was fully utilized from the get-go despite the fact that the sun was still up — the constant presence of theatrical smoke helped make the light show visible in spite of daylight.</p>\n<p>The crowd, initially unprepared for the sudden blast of lights and sound, started to get into it by the second song (“Our Demons”). An Egyptian-inspired statue of a hooded woman in space with lasers coming out of her eyes rotated and morphed on the screen. “Alright everyone, get your hands up! Let’s touch the sky!” Ooah shouted just before the song dropped.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara Bowl, you’re looking beautiful tonight,” Boreta proclaimed midway through the set. “This is my hometown, I grew up here. So this means a lot.” The crowd cheered appreciatively in reply.</p>\n<p>It was surprising to see only about a third of the audience dancing during most of Glitch Mob’s set. Though everyone seemed entranced by the spectacle of the performance, most of the crowd wasn’t interested in raging their faces off. This goes against what one might expect at a Glitch Mob show, but was not at all disappointing.</p>\n<p>A 30-minute intermission gave the crowd enough time to make it to the front of lines for drinks and food. After sunset, a sudden flurry of strobe lights, fog and sound announced the arrival of Chromeo. As the sound and strobes built, a three-syllable chant began: “Chrome-ee-oh, oh-oh” went the crowd, over and over. Then the duo broke into “Night By Night” for their first song.</p>\n<p>“Ooooooooh, what’s up Santa Barbara?” keyboardist P-Thugg (aka Patrick Gemayel) intoned in a synthesized robotic voice effect. “Can I hear you scream?” The crowd cheered, but apparently not loud enough for P-Thugg, who replied in his robot voice, “I said, can I hear you scre-eeeeeeeeam?” The crowd cheered wildly.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a leather jacket, black skinny jeans artfully ripped on one knee and tan suede shoes, singer/guitarist Dave 1 (aka David Macklovitch) is the attention-loving entertainer of the duo. He would come close to the crowd to solo for his adoring fans, jump all around the stage, feature pelvic gyrating prominently in his dance repertoire and talk frequently to the audience. P-Thugg, clad in flame print harem pants and a black sweatshirt, stayed mostly within the space between the five synths surrounding him. Occasionally he would leave it to play bass.</p>\n<p>Chromeo’s stage set-up featured three synthesizers for Dave 1 (in addition to P-Thugg’s five) and for each member, a pole-like structure containing drum pads and symbols. The two synths facing the audience were perched on light-up stands in the shape of women’s legs. The raised floor beneath them light up around the edges in a variable color scheme to match the stage lights, which was a cool effect. For every song the stage technicians pulled out all the stops with regard to the light show. During “Momma’s Boy,” a light was aimed at Dave 1’s reflective guitar to allow him to point it dramatically (and euphemistically) at audience members while he soloed.</p>\n<p>“I just want to give a shout out to the ladies on shoulders in the crowd right here” the guitarist said, smiling. “You know what guys, be courteous, find a girl nearby and pop her on your shoulders.” At Dave 1’s continued encouragement, most of the pit and a good portion of the seated sections were soon full of girls on shoulders.</p>\n<p>The crowd grooved and danced through every one of Chromeo’s songs. Never more so than during “Jealous,” arguably the catchiest song they have written to date. The crowd protested in surprise when Dave 1 and P-Thugg abruptly stepped off after “Jealous,” demanding an encore that, frankly, seemed certain to come.</p>\n<p>A few minutes of cheering at the empty stage and Chromeo returned to play “Fall Back 2U” for the delighted crowd. Dave 1 gave a shout-out to The Glitch Mob before closing with their first hit “Needy Girl,” accompanied by a rather overwhelming chaos of strobe lights.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Christina Cobos mentioned after the show that she attended primarily to see Chromeo. She was impressed with what the duo could do considering they were only two people and thought the light show was awesome. “Jealous” was her favorite song.</p>\n<p>Though the crowd seemed most enthusiastic toward Chromeo, all three acts gave excellent performances. Each transported the audience into their own unique retro-futuristic fantasy world, and as the best concerts do, allowed people to get lost in the experience.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhmUnk454MA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-07/chromeo-and-glitch-mob-funk-ify-the-sb-bowl/","id":6939,"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton"},"related":[6938,6937,6936],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":741,"name":"Devon McNaughton","biography":"Not available","articles":[6930,6931,6939,6988,7083,7099,7560,7724,7746],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Talented Ones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Yussef El Guindi’s “The Talented Ones” premiered Thursday night.

This show was brought to the Hatlen stage by LAUNCH PAD, a program through which playwrights come to UCSB to create new works. This year was LAUNCH PAD’s 10th Anniversary, and a great milestone in LAUNCH PAD history: Two plays developed through LAUNCH PAD had their world premieres as professional productions at regional theaters. “Kingdom City” by Sheri Wilner opened at La Jolla Playhouse in September of 2014 and James Still’s “Appoggiatura” opened at the Denver Center.</p>\n<p>The Artistic Director of LAUNCH PAD is Risa Brainin, who started the program to bring acclaimed playwrights to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My impulse for starting LAUNCH PAD was a need I saw for playwrights; their work was getting caught in a cycle of readings and workshops. It was very hard for them to get their professional premiere, and when they did, it was such a high-pressure situation that they didn’t have a chance to work on it in a safe environment. I saw there’s something we can do here that bridges that gap.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sarah Ruhl’s “Melancholy Play” was the first in-progress production to be worked on at UCSB, and a year later, Ruhl won the MacArthur Fellowship. Though “Melancholy Play” had already been performed, Brainin provided her with a space to continue perfecting her work. Brainin explained that every playwright comes to LAUNCH PAD at different stages in their process, but the idea is to give the writers facilities to experiment.</p>\n<p>On Yussef El Guindi in particular, Brainin revealed that “The Talented Ones” had been “overwritten” by the time he arrived at LAUNCH PAD.</p>\n<p>“Yussef likes to write too much and then cut [unnecessary material] … He likes to overwrite and put a lot of backstory in for the characters and things that are not necessarily needed in the end but are very helpful along the way.” Guindi’s play, “Threesome,” is performing off Broadway in June and he was one of three people nominated for the Genius Award by <em>The Stranger</em> magazine, a Seattle-based publication.</p>\n<p>Having seen Guindi’s overwritten version of <em>The Talented Ones</em>, Brainin revealed that one particular aspect of the show advocated it as a great work to bring to LAUNCH PAD.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons I thought “The Talented Ones” would be really great was because all the characters are young, they’re all in their 20s, so that’s perfect for our BFA students.” Not to say that the plays developed through LAUNCH PAD must cater to the student actors; Brainin utilizes actors from the graduate department, faculty and even local actors outside of the university as the need arises.</p>\n<p>“The Talented Ones” provided a wonderful opportunity for five BFA acting students to watch a play in progress, one of whom was Joré Aaron-Broughton, who won an Indy Award for her recent performance as Oya in “In the Red and Brown Water.”</p>\n<p>“For an actor, the script is the source for so much of the information regarding your character. It’s the foundation of who that person is and what kind of story the play is trying to tell. With the usual play, that source is a stable one … but with LAUNCH PAD, your foundation has the possibility of changing in a large way … The fact that with every performance a change can happen is yet another reason for an actor like myself to stay present and be ready for anything.”</p>\n<p>“The Talented Ones” will be performed at the Hatlen Theater until May 30, and will likely feature variations from night to night. May 30 is also the date of BFA auditions for UCSB’s theater program, open to all who wish to try out!

Projected upon them as the music started were two halves of a rectangle, one side white and one side black. Following the music perfectly, images of a rose, leaves and other organic matter began to appear in each half. Though not identical, the two halves were complimentary, and a red accent began to appear in the design as the music turned more aggressive.</p>\n<p>This was Federico Llach and Gary Goldberg’s <em>This Time Around</em>, with the video projection designed by Gary Goldberg. The two musicians were flautist Adriane Hill and Llach himself on the double bass. Llach and Goldberg write in the program that they were inspired by the idea of opposing cycles. The flute and the double bass are “instruments of extreme ranges and by exploring the brightest and darkest colors, the emptiest and most saturated textures, the lowest and highest registers.”</p>\n<p>Llach was one of 11 graduate composers who presented <em>Music in Memory</em> Sunday night in remembrance of last May’s tragedy. Brandon J. Rolle introduced the show as a reflective response on the part of the composers, each demonstrating their own healing process.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“There is no right or wrong way to grieve, to remember or to pray.” As part of a trio with Rolle’s composition, <em>prayer</em>, Fernando Rincón Estrada presented <em>de la ausencia, la esperanza, de la esperanza, la fortaleza</em>; translated to English, the title reads ‘from absence hope, from hope strength.’ Estrada’s music had a breathy quality, though three of the four instruments were strings. Like many of the pieces performed, Estrada’s composition was accentuated by silences between phrases of music, serving to increase the significance of every note. A percussive twist was assigned to cellist Kathryn Carlson, who struck her cello with her fist between sections of music to create a hollow, resounding beat.</p>\n<p>In addition to the classical instruments, certain works presented employed the use of electronics to enhance or create varying sounds. David Gordon set his composition <em>Echo</em> to a video of various bodies of moving water. Ripples, waves, and cascades of water contrasted with the tense, occasionally eerie music, though the work as a whole maintained a calm and collected feel.</p>\n<p>The serenity of Gordon’s composition was a repeated theme in the performance, for the most part unbroken until composer Heena Yoon’s <em>Fugue and Variations</em>. Performed by four strings, a beehive-like frenzy diverged from the tranquility, charging the atmosphere with a tense, energetic mood. The difference brought to attention the more passionate and angry side of loss.</p>\n<p>The composers drew inspiration for their pieces from many places, among them Buddhism, famous poets and original poems. Nick Norton, who composed a piece he named <em>Elegy II</em>, told the audience “I tend to ask musical questions [when I compose] … but this piece asked an emotional question. I attempted to ignore all the questions and just write.”</p>\n<p>A solo composition, Jordan Warmath on the viola began as a lonely melody echoing throughout the concert hall. After a minute, however, the music asked her to play two strings at a time, which created the auditory illusion of someone else on stage with her. It seemed to be a musical showcase of the efforts we make to maintain the presence those who have passed.</p>\n<p><em>Music in Memory</em> is one step amongst many that the students and faculty of UCSB have been taking to heal from the events of last May through art and through community. Though the audience Sunday night was not large, it was an open-hearted gathering of people choosing music as a path forward.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-05/music-in-memory-ucsb-remembers-isla-vista-2014-in-concert/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-05/music-in-memory-ucsb-remembers-isla-vista-2014-in-concert/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-05/music-in-memory-ucsb-remembers-isla-vista-2014-in-concert/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-05/music-in-memory-ucsb-remembers-isla-vista-2014-in-concert/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-05/music-in-memory-ucsb-remembers-isla-vista-2014-in-concert/","id":6937,"author":{"id":742,"name":"Sammy Gerraty"},"related":[6936,6935,6934],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Outside Lands to Invade Golden Gate Park","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While signifying tanning sessions and beach outings in most American locales, the month of August in San Francisco demarcates two happenings unique to the city.

First, a perfectly sadistic climate that is cold enough to render T-shirts unsuitable as standalone outerwear, but warm enough to make coat-wearers sweat, settles over the iconic city. The more agreeable event of the two is the return of the annual Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival.</p>\n<p>August 7th marks the opening of the fairgrounds for the eighth installation in the OSL series since its debut. Although the festival has received international commercial attention and a surge in attendance since its humble beginnings, its producers, Another Planet Entertainment and Starr Hill, still manage to maintain an <em>ars gratia artis</em> feel. A.P.E. and SH even made certain to bring back Ben Harper, Cold War Kids, Wilco and the Black Keys, from the first lineup in 2008. This act not only serves as a testament to OSL’s tasteful booking, but also feels as if the agencies are saying, “Thanks for helping us get here. We didn’t forget.”</p>\n<p>Of course, since then, OSL has experience rapid growth in other respects. Household names ­– Elton John, Sam Smith and Mumford &amp; Sons – will accompany the previously mentioned veteran headliners on this year’s bill. These bookings reflect an inevitably strengthening preference for pop music that all rapidly growing festivals develop and undoubtedly will draw many greenhorn OSL festivalers. This humble guide will help those newbies navigate and enjoy the lively (and sometimes daunting) San Francisco jungle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For first-timers, the most important note is that OSL isn’t Coachella. This fest has a generally different feel than its desert-dwelling sister. While the lineup is littered with occasional big name electronic acts (RL Grime, Axwell &amp; Ingrosso, DJ Mustard to name a few), it is not as large of a focus in the Northern California fest. As a result of this reduced electronic presence, the crowd tends to be a little less party-hardy, but no less friendly.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as I said earlier the climate is not always the most welcoming. Maybe you’d been waiting all weekend to dance during Vampire Weekend’s set at Outside Lands 2013. Maybe, despite your Ezra Koenig devotion, the cold crippled your legs and covered them with goosebumps because maybe you made the poor decision to wear shorts. Maybe this a true story. “The coldest winter I have ever spent was a summer in San Francisco,” is a quote often falsely attributed to Mark Twain. However, this not-Mark-Twain quote has some wisdom to share. If sporting a sundress or low-cut Chubbies to Golden Gate Park is absolutely mandatory, pack a hoodie just in case. The fog can be unforgiving.</p>\n<p>Third: Eat some good food. You’re at a large and expensive festival to hear your favorite jams. You’re at least part hedonist. Foodies often call San Francisco the brunch capital of the country. It is. Locals respect and take pride in their eating.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a thrifty dining experience, the food trucks are for you. Craving something greasy, savory and guilt-inducing? Through rigorous in-lab experimentation with the most delectable of American and Mexican delicacies, the guys at Bacon Bacon truck have rolled up flavor-optimized BBQ bacon burritos just for you. If you are hunting for something more refined, acclaimed local neo-American bistro Stones Throw,will be cooking up mouthwatering chicken parmesan sandwiches. Unfortunately, they refused to bring famous squid ink pasta to the concert, but will still satisfy your inner gourmand.</p>\n<p>This last set of tips isn’t necessarily OSL specific, but good advice for festivals in general. Try to see at least one set at every stage. Golden Gate Park is a lush, green paradise in the concrete metropolis of San Francisco. Go exploring. Set aside time for your must-see acts, but leave time for wandering to a performance that sounds good by a group you’ve never heard of. Make sure to talk to other festival-goers. Attendees are generous of spirit. You never know if the person buying fries in front of you is the ex-manager of Nirvana, a father taking five-year-old son to his first live performance or someone in need of a friend after losing their group.</p>\n<p>The festival consistently books one of the most tasteful lineups and boasts one of the most diverse crowds of any festival. It’s near impossible not to have a good time … as long as you catch Mac Demarco and Benjamin Booker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64386\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/outside-lands-to-invade-golden-gate-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64386\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/outside-lands-to-invade-golden-gate-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/outside-lands-to-invade-golden-gate-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/outside-lands-to-invade-golden-gate-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/outside-lands-to-invade-golden-gate-park/","id":6938,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6937,6936,6935],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
