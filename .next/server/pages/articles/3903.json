Hosts: Dancing With the Idiots</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 25, 11:35 p.m. — Officers patrolling a busy Del Playa Drive couldn’t help but take notice as a flamboyant 18-year-old strutted by.</p>\n<p>With revelry in the air, the young man had decided to entertain the masses with his groovy dance moves… from atop a moving car.</p>\n<p>As the vehicle made its way through the crowd surrounding it, the deputies made their way towards the tipsy-toed dancer and yelled at him to get down. The inebriated performer was in the zone, however, and failed to heed the officer’s demand.</p>\n<p>The deputies, having already tried their hands at diplomacy, reverted to plan B and grabbed the artist by the shirt and dragged him to the ground.</p>\n<p>With his run as lead dancer in the Car-top Cabaret over, the rising star was forced to face the music and stood motionless as the deputies slapped on the cuffs.</p>\n<p>And the Damage Done</p>\n<p>Sun., Sept. 27, 1:13 a.m. — A late night altercation in a Del Playa parking lot turned out to be more than one officer could handle.</p>\n<p>Once on the scene, the officers approached a bloodied 18-year-old and asked him what had happened, to which he replied, “Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz…” Pressed further, the out-of-towner continued to ramble about California’s favorite hippie enclave, but ironically, refused to say where he was from.</p>\n<p>With no other options, the deputy arrested him and sat him on the curb to wait for a van to take him to jail. But the slug wasn’t ready to be salted just yet, and while the officer was looking down at his notepad, he made his break and started sprinting down the street.</p>\n<p>The deputy made chase, and his attempts to taser the escapee failed. And then his own legs failed him: just paces from catching up, the officer lost his footing and ate shit in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers don’t work alone, though, and a fellow member of the Foot Patrol was able to tackle the fleeing northerner. The damage, however, had already been done.</p>\n<p>If Only It Was Twist-Off</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 15, 11:28 p.m. — Deputies on patrol near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and Pasado Road stopped an inebriated man after he stumbled into several parked cars.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the unsteady stroller where he lived, and he was quick to tell them that he lived at “243 Sabado.” But before the deputies could tell him such an address doesn’t exist, he pointed to a house at the corner of the intersection and told them he lived there.</p>\n<p>Feeling pretty certain that the 20-year-old was making things up, the deputies asked the lost boy if he could call a friend to walk him home. The drunken UCSB student said he could and proceeded to pull out his keys from his front pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure of his intentions, the officers asked him a second time if he would call a friend. This time, the man pointed to a bottle opener attached to his keys and said, “O.K., it’s right here.”</p>\n<p>Whether he thought the bottle opener was a phone, or perhaps a friendly escort, the officers couldn’t tell, but such clarification was not needed to arrest him for public intoxication.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/","id":3903,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3902,3901,3900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Effects of 2015 Oil Spill Persist, Researchers Say","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One year later: The Refugio oil spill, which released 80,000 gallons of crude oil onto a shore 15 miles northwest of UCSB, has lasting effects.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71132\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71132\" data-attachment-id=\"71132\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/refugio-by-stephen-manga-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Refugio 5/19\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71132\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Refugio-by-Stephen-Manga-ONLINE-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=750%2C500\" alt=\"Nearly a year after the Refugio Oil Spill, which dumped 142,800 gallons of crude oil onto nearby beaches, ecological conditions at Refugio Beach state park are steadily improving.

Within two weeks of the pipe rupture, workers and volunteers found 87 birds, 11 dolphins and 42 sea lions that had died as a result of the oil spill, according to the Bren Hall panel.</p>\n<p>The beaches have since reopened and the oil is all but gone from the shore. However, researchers continue to periodically collect balls of tar for analysis, a process known as tarball fingerprinting.</p>\n<p>“There are some issues with that analysis, because, at this point, a lot of the tarballs are very weathered,” said Jenna Driscoll of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, a nonprofit organization working to protect and restore the Channel.</p>\n<p>Being able to distinguish whether a tarball originates from the Line 901 spill or if it is simply part of a natural oil slick is an important factor in allowing scientists to determine the extent of the damage and how long the cleanup will last. However, at this point there is no definitive technology that permits researchers to distinguish the exact origin of a particular tarball.</p>\n<p>“Those samples should be used to identify response rather than impact,” Driscoll said. “There does have to be some formal method of closing response efforts. A year out, you no longer need to send people to the beaches to respond to oil coming up on the shore.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Response</strong><br>\nState-designed plans are supposed to account for cleanup operations, but environmental groups say the plans were not adequate for the specific situation.</p>\n<p>After the Refugio spill, there was largely a lack of coordinated response between state and federal agencies, county organizers and local environmental groups, according to Linda Krop, chief counsel at the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We were completely floored with the lack of on-the-ground response,” Krop said. “On the evening of the 19th, not a soul was doing cleanup; the beach was full of oil and every wave was taking oil out to sea.”</p>\n<p>After attending state and federal briefings the morning after the spill, Krop said the state and federal regulations for spill responses were not adequate in addressing the immediate action required in the aftermath of the Refugio spill.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have a plan in place for when you have a spill that starts onshore and threatens to go offshore,” Krop said. “That’s one of the things we need to work on.”</p>\n<p>Since then, both Santa Barbara County officials and local environmental organizations have worked to implement more substantial plans of action that dictate immediate cleanup efforts to take place in the event of an oil spill.</p>\n<p>“The response is still ongoing through the end of this calendar year. We still have county personnel out on the main impact site, going out and assessing that area for impact,” Robert Troy, deputy director for the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management, said. “We’ve been working diligently for the past few months and will continue to do so.”</p>\n<p><strong>Legal and Economic Repercussions</strong><br>\nEnvironmental legislation is often passed in the wake of some sort of natural or manmade disaster, such as in the case of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio spill, several local groups worked alongside the county and the state, pushing for both new state and national legislation to more strictly enforce environmental protection.</p>\n<p>“We’ve continued to work tirelessly, even a year after the spill, to move legislation forward and to work with these environmental agencies to improve response efforts as well as education and outreach,” Driscoll said.</p>\n<p>Their efforts led to the passing of state laws SB 295, AB 864 and the Rapid Oil Spill Response Act (SB 414), all of which are meant to create a faster and more effective response to a future oil spill. In addition, the Pipeline Safety Act (HR 5050) was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the federal legislative level, which increases the frequency of inline pipeline inspection in ecologically rich areas.</p>\n<p>“As a law firm we were looking at various legal issues,” Krop said. “We looked at the regulations that apply to these pipelines, we learned that the federal regulations for this particular pipeline are much weaker than what we do in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of

Just to think about my child crossing all these areas … I don’t think he’ll be able to do this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>One meeting attendee insisted that the current plan furthered “the college interest and not the elementary school interest,” and another suggested that the most logical, long-term solution to benefit the community was a pedestrian bridge.</p>\n<p>“What has happened to those cones [at the intersection] will happen to our children,” said Felipe Garcia, a 20-year resident of I.V. “Every single one of those cones has been hit.”</p>\n<p>According to Derek Rapp, a Stantec engineer who is overseeing the construction, the company considered children when drawing up their plans, and the crosswalk will work to improve an already low statistic of four accidents at the intersection in the past five years.</p>\n<p>If the proposed changes come to fruition, I.V. Elementary will potentially need two more crossing guards, and several students who live at Santa Catalina and San Joaquin will be directed to park at Lot 50, Lot 30 and Lot 38 to decongest the intersection.</p>\n<p>Fisher also said that the university will place a “de-emphasis on cars and a strong emphasis on bicycle and bus circulation” as over 3,000 beds are added to Santa Catalina and San Joaquin housing over the next year.</p>\n<p>The university is paying for construction and design of the new project and Santa Barbara County has the authority to approve all necessary permits. The construction is projected to be complete by the start of the I.V. Elementary school year on Aug. 23.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to get this up and operational for this fall, so it needs to keep moving,” Fisher said. “Personally, I feel this is going to be far safer than the current condition.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71820\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71820\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-07/isla-vistans-raise-concerns-against-ucsb-construction/","id":3901,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3900,3899,3898],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 9, 11:11 p.m. - Officers navigating the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive went to work when they spotted a barefooted young lady leaning against a parked car.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fast Times at Dos Pueblos High</p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 9, 11:11 p.m. – Officers navigating the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive went to work when they spotted a barefooted young lady leaning against a parked car.</p>\n<p>The deputies walked over and asked the petite drinker how she was feeling, but her attempts at making conversation came out only as gibberish.</p>\n<p>The officer then asked if she knew where she was, and she replied, “I’m 18. I’m 18. I know. I know.” He tried the question again, but again she muttered the same response. Ten times he asked, and always got the same answer.</p>\n<p>But when asked her date of birth, the “18-year-old” told them 7-4-92, making her 17. When told this, she started to cry and tried to walk away.</p>\n<p>But the officer caught a glimpse of her cell phone and asked to use it to call her mother. Once on the line, mommy told the deputy her darling daughter was in fact 16 years old.</p>\n<p>The officers then walked the Dos Pueblo junior to the I.V. police station, where her mother was set to meet them. With mother and daughter reunited, the soon-to-be-grounded-forever young lady stood up to leave and immediately vomited on the floor.</p>\n<p>But mommy was there to insist paramedics take her to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, where she was housed, pending an unhappy conversation with the ‘rents.</p>\n<p>A Friend in Need</p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 9, 12:43 a.m. – Deputies on patrol were dispatched to an apartment complex on the 6600 block of Del Playa on reports there was an intoxicated squatter in the apartment.</p>\n<p>The officers arrived and the tenants told them that an unknown guy had walked right through the front door, vomited in the living room and then fell fast asleep on the couch.</p>\n<p>Making sure not to step in his pile of sick, the deputies made their way toward the couch and found the 19-year-old man passed out face down in a pile of his own vomit.</p>\n<p>After much effort, the officers woke the heavily inebriated man and got him to his feet. Having lost his shirt somewhere, the man was led out into the cold night air with dried vomit clinging to his bare chest.</p>\n<p>Always willing to take in a friend in need, the deputies then transported the sleepy squatter to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-14/police-blotter-42/","id":3902,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3901,3900,3899],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
