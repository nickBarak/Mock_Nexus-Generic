One significant difference between the two parties lies in how each decides on the yearly slate, with DP choosing its slate through an open primary and OPP through an interview process.</p>\n<p>As for their mission statements, the parties differ only slightly. DP stated on its Facebook event page for its informational sessions that the party’s primary goal is to “challenge the status quo” of A.S. by demanding that the student government become more “Associated with YOU” as an inclusive group for all students, as opposed to remaining “exclusive to a privileged few.” OPP also professed inclusivity, claiming on their own Facebook event page that they value the “honest and absolute representation of each and every student” at UCSB.</p>\n<p>OPP will hold its last informational session tonight from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m at the San Nicolas Classroom. DP will hold two sessions tonight at 8 p.m. in both the Loma Pelona Center and Gibraltar Center in Santa Ynez, with two more sessions to occur Feb. 24 and another two on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit OPP’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ucsbOPP and DP’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ucsbDPparty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-election-season-starts-with-information-sessions/","id":3044,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3043,3042,3041],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Representatives from the Student Commission on Racial Equality and the Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs also gave presentations on ongoing projects, in addition to the discussion of other issues and projects, such as a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert that will be held at the Hub on Mar. 6.</p>\n<p>In regard to the marijuana legalization debate, Senators decided to revisit discussion on the bill near the end of the meeting after it had already been passed without deliberation. This discussion incited passionate exchanges on both sides of the issue, with Senators Andre Theus, Amir Khazhaeli, Nick Onyshko, and Montana MacLachlan voicing opposition to the bill. Khazaieli said he feared the bill would reflect badly on UCSB’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“As representatives of the entire student body, taking a stance like this is completely counteractive to the whole notion of promoting UCSB as not a party school, not an ‘OK, get high and not care about anything,’” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Taylor supported the bill, and referred to a position supported by Assemblymember Das Williams, and he argued that one potential benefit of legalization would be the reduction of violence and profits connected to transnational drug cartels.</p>\n<p>“If the taxation happens and we legalize it, that could be taking money out of drug cartels,” Taylor said. “If there is a legalization and it’s going towards a good cause, not only will it be going towards benefiting higher education, but it could be a pipeline to stopping certain drug cartel interactions.”</p>\n<p>At one point, it was revealed that the entire Senate body lacked some knowledge on the legal status of marijuana in the state, when Off-Campus Senator Nick Onyshko asked the question to all senators of whether marijuana was decriminalized in California and did not receive an accurate response until a fellow senator researched the issue.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus, who opposed the bill, said he was frustrated with his fellow senators’ conduct shortly after the confusion.</p>\n<p>“I am extremely, extremely … disappointed with my Senate tonight,” Theus said. “People in this room don’t even know what the current rates are for a misdemeanor or what the actual revenue’s going to bring in … I think we need to bring that back to the Senate, with all of us being educated on the issues of the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she agreed with Theus regarding the Senate’s actions, and added her own personal sentiment.</p>\n<p>“I’m pissed,” MacLachlan said. “I feel very personally offended.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Student Commission on Racial Equality co-chair Hani Tajsar gave a presentation to the Senate regarding the Facing Race Conference that will be held at the SRB on Feb. 22nd. The event seeks to educate students on issues that affect students of color, and anyone who attends will receive a free S.C.O.R.E. t-shirt and free tacos.</p>\n<p>Tajsar also advocated student action that would continue and improve efforts to recruit and help undocumented and low-income students graduate at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The recruitment and retention rate for undocumented students and low-income students in general, is something that I’m ashamed of … and we should all push for a better system,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation on the controversial proposal for a new development in Isla Vista, which would be located at the current site of the bar Dublin’s at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar. The four-story building, called The Nest has received much criticism from students, according to Moore, which is why he plans to work against the project.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, I’m representing student opinions,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed during the meeting included the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert to be held on Mar. 6, as well as updates from Erick Lankey about promoting food insecurity awareness through the A.S. Food Bank, a progress report on the petition being distributed by the UCen S.U.R.F. initiative and updates on a leadership conference hosted by the Office of Student Life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Senator Amir Khazaieli led the opposition, while in fact multiple senators opposed the bill. In addition, it was wrongly stated that Senator Montana MacLachlan disagreed with Senator Andre Theus when in fact she agreed with his frustration with the Senate. The article has been updated to incorporate these corrections.</em>]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/","id":3041,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3040,3039,3038],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ray Alonso Appointed Judicial Council Chair, Plans To Focus on Accessibility and Empathy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3782.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3782.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Raymond Alonso was appointed Judicial Council Chair at the Associated Students Senate meeting on Wednesday evening.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Second-year political science and history of public policy double major Raymond Alonso was appointed Judicial Council Chair at the Associated Students Senate meeting on Wednesday evening.</p>\n<p>Alonso has been serving on the Council since last spring, when he was appointed by former Associated Students (A.S.)

President Brooke Kopel had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">appointed</a> four members to the council after <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/a-s-postpones-council-vote-for-second-week/\">concerns</a> about conflicts of interest plagued her choice for the position of chair, current council member Justin Nilsen.</p>\n<p>According to Alonso, the council internally determined that Alonso was the best decision for chair.</p>\n<p>Alonso spoke about his plans for the position of chair at Wednesday’s meeting and in an interview with the Nexus, highlighting his interest in “broadening the accessibility of Judicial Council.”</p>\n<p>He plans to do so in two ways: by reaching out to various boards, commissions and units (BCUs) on campus and by introducing more empathy in judicial council proceedings.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to the judicial process, what often gets left out are the struggles of individuals from various communities, and that allows other people to misinterpret or misunderstand the decisions of other individuals that may have made necessary a judicial council case,” he said in the interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>“I want to do this in order to really give people who might not be as easily understood the ability to be understood.”</p>\n<p>He noted that, while the council is “alright, in terms of a diverse body,” there is always more that can be done to make the judicial process more equitable.</p>\n<p>Alonso said he also wants to work with various BCUs to increase their involvement and understanding of A.S. Legal Code, and wants to encourage them to reach out to the council if they have any concerns about legal code violations.</p>\n<p>“Almost every body of Associated Students violates legal code, accidentally, or on purpose, but usually accidentally. We want to make ourselves known to other people, like hey, if something is happening in your BCU which violates legal code and you don’t like this, we have legal code for a reason, and that’s something that you can come to us about,” he added.</p>\n<p>By gaining a better understanding of A.S. Legal Code, organizations can operate in the most efficient manner, Alonso said, which is his ultimate goal with the Council.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gone to a few BCU meetings myself, the bodies are great, and they have these brilliant missions, but because they aren’t super informed on legal code, they get stuck in a lot of… bureaucratic red tape,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It just really paralyzes action, and I want people to have the best understanding of legal code because it was designed very specifically to allow A.S. to function, not to prevent it from functioning.”</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Senate Wednesday evening, Alonso fielded questions about how he would address conflicts of interest and potential biases that could crop up.</p>\n<p>In response, Alonso affirmed that he was committed to transparency, both amongst council members and from himself. Alonso also noted that last spring, when the council encountered a case where he had a conflict of interest, he immediately recused himself from the discussion.</p>\n<p>Alonso also said the council has been discussing possible bias trainings that they could undergo in order to make the judicial proceedings as fair and understanding as they can be.</p>\n<p>Internally, Alonso plans on revamping the Council’s office space in order for them to be able to hear cases in their office, instead of spending the bulk of their minimal budget on renting out spaces to hear cases.</p>\n<p>He also plans to make the process of submitting a petition more clear by creating a Google form with mandatory questions, noting that petitions that were submitted last spring were bogged down with technicalities and are now being dealt with over six months later.</p>\n<p>Making the office as efficient as it can be is Alonso’s goal for his time as chair, but it’s also important to him to introduce an aspect of warmth to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all people within UCSB are able to feel safe and comfortable and know that the Association has their back.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senate last week, claiming that the process of establishing the logo was not “inclusive” enough of the student body.</p>\n<p>The logo was part of a resolution authored by senators Ali Guthy and Beatrice Contreras that established both an official A.S. logo and an official Senate logo in order to “increase the overall visibility of the association.” However, Abboud sent out a press release on Saturday announcing his veto decision, specifying that the process of passing the logo contained “a lack of inclusive decision-making.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Abboud said A.S. is “in need of a major image upgrade stylistically,” but “all who participate in the activities of Associated Students” should be able to take part in the process of that upgrade. He urged the Senate to publicly solicit contributions for logo ideas and then encourage all “A.S. entities to make their opinions known.”</p>\n<p>The logo issue hit close to home for Abboud, as he said all students should be able to be a part of the incredible projects and events of A.S.</p>\n<p>“I believe each and every person in A.S. and even the student body should have had a chance to submit designs and submit their opinion,” Abboud said in an email.</p>\n<p>Contreras said that while she understands the president’s rationale, she hopes the matter will be resolved quickly, as the Senate has already devoted ample time to the deliberation.</p>\n<p>“President Abboud said that he wasn’t comfortable with the outreach efforts, and I feel that this was a reasonable argument,” Contreras said. “But the Senate had been deliberating on the logo for weeks and very few people voiced concerns, so it didn’t seem like anyone was openly opposed to the change.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53899\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53899\" data-attachment-id=\"53899\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/new-a-s-logo-is-a-no-go-a-s-president-rejects-design/logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53899\" alt=\"Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Logo.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-53899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although the new logo (above) passed through Senate without opposition, it was vetoed by President Abboud.</p></div>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Associated Students of UCSB.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, February 6, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
