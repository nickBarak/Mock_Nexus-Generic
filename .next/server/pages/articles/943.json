If you’re trying to get it right, you will improve. And this group has really improved.”</p>\n<p>Things in the Big West are heating up, and the Gauchos are beginning to pick up momentum. They’ve had some rough close losses along the way, but Coach Henrickson is certain that this team is determined.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to sustain the effort and the intensity and the activity that it takes to be successful. We know we are who we believe we are,” she said.</p>\n<p>The confidence is palpable with UCSB, and it will need to carry that into its next game agaiunst UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play its second consecutive game at home, as the Gauchos will host UCI at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 17 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/gauchos-rout-titans-in-home-showdown/","id":943,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[942,941,940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[131,204,215,657,663,711,766,844,881,895,896,942,943,948,949,974,1877,3388,3400],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Softball Struggles In Season Opening Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team concluded its season-opening 11-game road trip this past weekend, losing all five of their games in the Campbell/Cartier Classic, which was hosted by the University of San Diego...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team concluded its season-opening 11-game road trip this past weekend, losing all five of their games in the Campbell/Cartier Classic, which was hosted by the University of San Diego and San Diego State.

Four errors and seven runners left on base prevented the Gauchos from mounting a comeback, with their lone run coming in the fifth inning on a single by sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not get off to a better start in the second game of the doubleheader. Oregon State jumped on the Gauchos in the first inning, scoring a run against sophomore pitcher Andriana Collins. The Beavers scored two more runs in the third and three in the fourth off Collins, who gave up six runs on nine hits in her seven innings of work.</p>\n<p>“We knew these teams were going to get us early and punch us and try to score,” Pilpil said. “We just needed to bounce back and punch them back but we obviously didn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had the tough task of playing against No.7 Washington in Saturday morning’s game. The Huskies drove Collins out of the first inning, scoring three runs before the first out was recorded. Santa Barbara was only able to muster one hit, striking out four times in five innings as Washington scored three runs in both the second and fourth to end the game on the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important to realize these are really good teams and that they will put runs up on the board,” DePompa said. “We just need to keep focusing on execution and getting the little things.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had its best performance offensively against Notre Dame in Saturday evening’s game. The Gauchos drew even with the Fighting Irish in the second inning when DePompa drove in freshman shortstop DeJanee Moore on a sacrifice fly. After a poor pitching performance earlier in the day, Collins allowed four runs in the third before being relieved by Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Two errors in the top of the fourth allowed UCSB to counter with three unearned runs. Sophomore right fielder McKenzie Kane brought home Pilpil on an error in left field and a throwing error by the pitcher allowed DePompa and Kane to come home. The Gauchos were left scoreless in the fifth before the Irish put the game out of reach with a run in the sixth to secure the 6-4 win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara lost to No. 12 UCLA in the final day of competition. Collins came on in relief and gave up three runs in the sixth inning, ending the game 8-0 by the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously kinda frustrating and disappointing because everyone wants to win,” Pilpil said. “We just have to take it as a learning process and focus on getting better each time. I think after these two weekends we realized what we need to do; hopefully now that we’re home this weekend we’ll bring it all together.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head home to host the Gaucho Classic, playing six games in four days.

UC Davis dropped to a 16-8 overall, 7-3 conference record and now sits in second place in the Big West, just one game back from Santa Barbara in the conference standings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into this game there was plenty of uncertainty in terms of how these two teams were going to match up. While they both had been battling it out in the Big West conference standings since the beginning of the season, the Gauchos and Aggies hadn’t actually played against each other yet on the court. Even the Davis students were anticipating this one, as the atmosphere at the Pavilion was almost play-off like at the tip-off with about 3,500 people in attendance.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first half was all UCSB however as the Gauchos came out of the gate scorching hot, building up a twenty point lead at one point and ultimately shooting over 60% from three for the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A huge part of SB’s first half dominance was the unselfish yet aggressive mindset that first year Coach Pasternack has imprinted on this team. The first four buckets by the Gauchos were all made by different players and all assisted on, and the ball-movement on offense was creating a lot of holes in a usually stout Aggie defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have seen many times throughout the season that just the threat of the Gaucho’s three point shooting has opened up countless passing and driving lanes, but when they’re actually knocking them down it becomes an almost impossible tasks for opposing defenses to guard them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it was a great team effort, the best player in the half for UCSB had to be Marcus Jackson. The graduate transfer from Rice finished the half with 15 points on 6-8 shooting, and continues to prove how important he is to the facilitation of the offense this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it should come to no surprise that Jackson is able to light up the scoreboard every now and then (he was the 35th player in Rice history to score 1,000 points in his time there), his high basketball IQ and ability to knock down the three adds an entirely new element to this Gaucho team that along with the performance of Leland King II and Max Heidegger so far has created arguably the best trio in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with all that SB was doing great the deficit was only 12 points going into halftime, mostly because of the play of Junior TJ Shorts II. The Aggie guard ultimately finished the game with 28 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds, and was tasked with making sure the lead didn’t get out of hand for most of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even at just 5’9, his quickness and shooting ability definitely puts him up on the short-list of best players in the conference, and he will be a big part of the scouting report for the Gauchos when they take on this team again next week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis actually made a run late in the second half, cutting the lead down to five with a minute to go in the game. Junior guard Siler Schneider broke past the 1,000 point mark with his first shot in the second half, a huge milestone for a player at this level, and scored 10 points in the last frame to keep the Aggies in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were able to hold Davis off thanks in part to the contributions of Junior Jarriesse Blackmon, whose 8 points off the bench in the half could not have came at a better time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Blackmon hasn’t been able to get much going on the offensive end in his time in this season, if performances like this become consistent it would be huge for this team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the Gauchos stay on the road as they get set to take on the other second place team in the Big West, Long Beach State. Although Thursday’s win was big, UCSB knows more than anyone that the season is not close to over, and they’ll have to keep fighting for anything they get.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB takes on LBSU at 7 p.m. on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The game, though it was close, ended with Santa Barbara getting the lead back and gaining the victory.</p>\n<p>Working hard for every basket they got, UCSB was able to edge out the home team by shooting a slightly higher field goal percentage (42.6 percent), compared to Cal State Fullerton’s (39.2 percent).</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another big game, achieving her third straight double-double with a stellar performance consisting of 22 points on 10-for-15 shooting and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Hannah Thompson led the Titans with 13 points, and freshman forward Carolyn Gill had a commanding 11 points and 8 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Gill has been a big factor for CSUF both offensively and defensively, as she got buckets and proceeded to force the Gauchos to commit several turnovers. The tandem duo of Thompson and Gill will be worth watching for Santa Barbara in the next game.</p>\n<p>Bench play for UCSB will need to be productive to keep up with CSUF’s bench play.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Triann Thompson and freshman forward Xinavane Foreman give the Titans a spark off the bench, and will need to be contained on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Thompson flirted with a double-double, contributing eight points and seven rebounds, while Foreman ended the game with six points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>When asked about what the team did right to end the game with a win and what she plans on implementing for Thursday’s matchup, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson noted:</p>\n<p>“I thought defensively we played great and had good pressure on the ball. We defended their half court sets. But give them credit. They did a great job,” Henrickson said. “They shot over 50 percent in both the third and fourth quarter to make it a ball game and take the lead. So we’ll take what we did to get up nearly 20, we’ll take what we didn’t do to give up and lose the lead and then we’ll take what we did to win the game. So there are three lessons in that.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson went on to speak about how the team game plan for the upcoming game will not differentiate much from their game plan the last time the Gauchos played the Titans just a few days ago.</p>\n<p>The visiting Gauchos showed a big defensive presence against Cal State Fullerton in the matchup and will need to bring that same energy and pressure on Thursday, if they want to end the game with the same result.</p>\n<p>Though CSUF is only 2-8 in conference play, Henrickson made it known that their upcoming opponents are not to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>“You can’t look at their record and say ‘they are this, because this is what their record is.’ They’re not. They have been in single-digit games, just like ours. We don’t do that going into the game,” she explained.</p>\n<p>“We are hunting and building momentum to try and get success. We’ve got to make sure to bring our A-game for forty minutes because we did for a chunk of the game, but obviously not when we allowed them to shoot such a high percentage from the floor. They got layups, offensive rebounds and got to the free throw line. We’ve got to turn them over and be more aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to remain focused on both ends of the court and be more conscientious about keeping any lead they build so as to obtain and sustain the advantage against CSUF.</p>\n<p>Catch the Gauchos against Cal State Fullerton at home in the Thunderdome tonight, Feb. 15 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Feb. 15</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/","id":942,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[941,940,939],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
