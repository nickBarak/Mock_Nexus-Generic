The junior notched nine strikeouts and managed to strike out the side swinging in the top of the fifth before making his exit an inning later.</p>\n<p>As usual the Gaucho bats took some time to heat up, but like in previous games the team managed to get the offense going in the fourth inning. Sophomore catcher Eric Yang hit an extra-base shot to left field which pushed sophomore utility Armani Smith across the plate for the first run scored in the game.</p>\n<p>In what would eventually be three consecutive innings with at least one run scored, Clay Fisher had his own extra-base drive to center right where he picked up two RBI’s to increase the UCSB lead to 3-0 at the top of the 6th.</p>\n<p>The home team’s final run of the game was scored by the quick-thinking feet of sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Thomas Rowan.</p>\n<p>After advancing to third on Jew’s single to center, Rowan was able to score on a throw to second as Jew was trying to steal the bag. The 4-0 lead was enough for skipper Andrew Checketts to pull Davis and put in Chris Clements for his opportunity to pick up a save.</p>\n<p>Like Davis, Clements was outstanding on the mound: allowing zero hits, zero runs, and striking out five over his three innings of work. The Gauchos cruised to victory after putting up two in the fifth, snagging the win, 4-0.</p>\n<p>Clements made well of his first save opportunity of the season and should the redshirt junior be able to carry his pitching success in starting as well as in relief he looks to be a valuable tool for the team if they make another deep run into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>With today’s solid start, Davis bounced back from his previous outing against San Diego State where the junior was pulled in less than two innings in a game where he allowed three hits and five earned runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ bats have been active all series against this Penn State pitching staff and the big four are making their usual impact felt in these important early season games.</p>\n<p>Penn State starter Taylor Lehman pitched a solid five innings with two earned runs allowed, but with an offense that was completely stifled behind him the pitching staff could only do the best they could to keep the lead from getting worse.</p>\n<p>Connor Larkin was called into the final two innings for the Penn State Nittany Lions and pitched well with no runs allowed. They are surely hoping for a bounce back game with a more active offense to support them.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play the final game of the series against Penn State on Monday, March 5th at 2 PM PST at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81912\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81912\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/","id":4266,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4265,4264,4263],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Out with the Old, In with the New: Latest Additions to Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IV-Shops_Angie-Banks_ONLINE-2-e1538026385526.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IV-Shops_Angie-Banks_ONLINE-2-e1538026385526.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At least six businesses closed down in Isla Vista during the past year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At least six businesses closed down in Isla Vista during the past year due to loss of profitability and the need to change locations among other reasons.

It had been located at 971 Embarcadero Del Mar for 14 years and at 6578 Trigo Road for eight years before that, according to Alfonso Espino, Hempwise owner.</p>\n<p>“We were really all about kind of being a hub for the community and… being there for people who are interested in these types of things, especially alternative resources,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise closed its location in I.V. because their lease was not renewed by the owners of the lot. Espino hopes to move the shop to a new location in I.V. or Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[We have] been kind of scrambling for a new location and haven’t been able to find anything in I.V., but hopefully we’ll find something soon,” Espino said.</p>\n<p>Hempwise had their last business day this past Monday and will be completely out of the building by the end of this month. Espino is still unsure when or where he will be able to open a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>SORRISO ITALIANO</strong></p>\n<p>The authentic Italian stop at 901 Embarcadero Del Mar closed in early June of this year, ending five years of business in I.V. with a wine tasting party.</p>\n<p>The owners, Antonio and Elisabetta Gerli, worked together in the restaurant, dividing the work between themselves. The long shifts and time taken away from family was a significant reason for closing, according to Antonio.</p>\n<p>“There are different reasons, but I think the most important was that my wife was the chef and I was in the front so we worked like 14 hours a day and we have a family,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>Sorriso also catered frequently for events for the UCSB Athletic Department.</p>\n<p>The couple recently accepted positions at Due Lune Cucina, an Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara. Antonio now works there as a manager and Elisabetta as executive chef. While they are enjoying the benefits of a lighter schedule, Antonio still reminisces on their time in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I miss Isla Vista because that was a great environment and good vibe, but you know, sometimes… you need to change your chapter of your life and we did it,” Gerli said.</p>\n<p><strong>KAPTAIN’S FIREHOUSE BBQ</strong></p>\n<p>Once wedged between Study Hall and Varsity Bike Shop at 6543 Pardall Road, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ shut down its location during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break in 2017.</p>\n<p>When it opened back in 2013, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ was a division of a larger company which also caters to festivals and large venues among other events.</p>\n<p>Despite its popularity in the early years as well as in other divisions of the company, the loss of popularity at the location in I.V. was a factor in its closure, according to Michael “The Kaptain” Gould, owner of the company.</p>\n<p>“For the first three years, we rocked it. We did really really really well. It was the last two years where it just became kind of stagnant,” The Kaptain said. “We made a couple changes to the menu, but it was kind of that I.V. rotation of restaurants that come through and it seemed like we had our run.”</p>\n<p>After expansions and growing success in the other divisions of his company, The Kaptain decided to close down the location in I.V. to concentrate on his other projects.</p>\n<p>“The easier thing to do would be to close I.V. and focus on, you know, where all our money was at.”</p>\n<p>The Kaptain recently opened a new division of his company which serves cold brew coffee and micro-brews at events, along with ribs, grilled wings and corn that was emblematic of the shack.</p>\n<p><em>Hiwi Tropical Fusion and Juice It Up, The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop and Rincon Brewery could not be reached for comment.</em></p>\n<p>While these businesses are closing their doors, new ones such as Hanamura on Embarcadero Del Mar, One Piece on Pardall Street and California Tacos and Taproom on Embarcadero del Norte have eagerly moved into their places.</p>\n<p><strong>CALIFORNIA TACOS AND TAPROOM</strong></p>\n<p>The fourth location of the Mexican fusion taco joint California Tacos and Taproom moved in the lot formerly occupied by The Grilled Cheese Truck Stop in August. Alex Uribe, the owner of the company, said he will be adding elements specifically designed for the demographic in Isla Vista, including televisions, 12 to 16 brews on tap and enhanced outdoor seating areas.</p>\n<p>“I think what was lacking before was a little bit of personality,” Uribe said. “I think that the students are looking for a good place to hang out, to have good food, a good atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Uribe is confident that the atmosphere of the restaurant and items of the menu will draw popularity to a notoriously unsuccessful property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Uribe, a UCSB alum, will also have his son, a current UCSB student, managing the restaurant and providing a student perspective on the business.</p>\n<p>“I used to go to UCSB a long time ago so I’m a little familiar with the area and although everything you know changes and evolves, I think I have a little bit better understanding than a regular person would come in and didn’t come to the school.”</p>\n<p>Uribe estimates California Tacos and Taproom will officially open around October 15 of this year.</p>\n<p><em>Hanamura and One Piece could not be reached for comment.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

One year removed from an improbable College World Series run had many people believing this was a team destined to do the same again in this campaign. And with the return of many key players, it’s easy to see why many truly believed that.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward 41 games into the regular season and reality are grim for Santa Barbara: a 19-22 overall record, a sixth-place standing in the Big West with a 5-7 record, and a very low chance of making it back to the NCAA Regionals for the third consecutive season, and fourth in five years.</p>\n<p>To be frank, unless the Gauchos win the rest of their 15 games, they are not going back, and even then, their chances are really low as the only silver lining would be that they swept a No. 8 Cal State Fullerton squad.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Focusing on the now, even if UCSB wants to attempt that, it needs to start with a sweep of a struggling UC Davis squad at home. UCD boasts a deflating 13-23 overall record and currently sits at seventh place in the conference with 5-10 Big West record.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Santa Barbara is in a position where it cannot afford to overlook any opponent, especially after dropping two of three against UC Riverside — albeit on the road — a team that was 14-22 overall and 2-10 in conference play ranking them at the bottom of the Big West when they faced the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the season, UCSB was really struggling at the plate, however, it has since righted the ship scoring at least six runs in 11 of its last 14 games and has also recorded double-digit hits in 11 of those 14.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Bush has been on a tear lately. The first baseman is currently on a six-game hitting streak batting 9-22 (.409) during that span including one extra-base hit and accounting for nine RBI’s. Bush is also the teams slugging leader at .538 which is also the fourth-best mark in the conference. He is also the first Gaucho since the 2001 campaign to have back-to-back seasons of 10 or more home runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also currently have three athletes who rank in the top 15 best batting averages in the conference in junior utility Colton Burns who ranks 11<sup>th</sup> with a .323 line, redshirt freshman outfielder Tommy Jew who ranks 14<sup>th</sup> with a .314 average, and redshirt junior utility Kenny Corey who rounds out the top 15 with a .313 mark.</p>\n<p>Jew, in particular, has also been great as he is currently on a 17-game hitting streak and ranks third on the team in total hits with 43. His slash line has also been nothing short of great with .314/.368/.474.</p>\n<p>On the mound, the Gauchos will again be without usual Friday starter Noah Davis (6-3, 4.57 ERA) who is out an illness. This means junior Kyle Nelson will most likely take the mound on Friday. The left-hander struggled last Friday giving up five hits and six earned runs in just 2.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Due to the Friday change, other changes were made including giving freshman Chris Lincoln his first start of the year. The right-hander got the call for the Sunday game and delivered with a solid 3.2 innings allowing four hits and two earned runs earning him a no decision.</p>\n<p>Davis comes into the match-up fresh off an impressive win 11-10 victory on Tuesday against a very impressive St. Mary’s team who has even beaten Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Ryan Hooper was a star in that series not only extending his hitting streak to 10 games but driving in a season-high three runs. During his last ten games, Hooper has been spectacular batting .429 (15-for-35) with nine runs scored, three doubles, a home run, and 10 RBI.</p>\n<p>All in all, this is a must-win series for UCSB. Despite most likely missing the postseason, the Gauchos still have the opportunity to develop their young talent for the future. Whatever it takes, Santa Barbara must come out in this series like its hair is on fire.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces UC Davis in a Big West three-game set beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 5 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

postseason, let alone the College World Series, are gone, but the show must go on.</p>\n<p>With 12 games left on the docket, this team still has the opportunity to improve and finish this year strong. The first chance the Gauchos will have will be today at St. Mary’s in hopes of evening up the series against the Gaels who currently sit at 30-17 on the year.</p>\n<p>These two California squads faced off earlier this season, with SMC coming out the victor in a 4-1 decision in Santa Barbara. At that time, UCSB was ranked the No. 23 team in the country.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara and St. Mary’s both took a game in the two-match series with each team winning on the road. Hoping to have a repeat of last season, the Gauchos will look to rely on freshman pitcher Ben Brecht to get the job done.</p>\n<p>The lefty has started the last five midweek games for UCSB and has done an admirable job earning a 3-1 record with a 3.19 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 30.1 innings pitched. On the year, the southpaw has an overall 3.52 ERA with 33 punchouts.</p>\n<p>Despite having a reliable pitcher on the mound, one concern still weighs heavily on the minds of fans, and that is the fact that the Gauchos are on the road. Santa Barbara is currently 5-13 on the road and does considerably worse in the box and on the mound.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB jumps from 3.46 ERA at home to a very disappointing 6.65 ERA when on the road. It also only has a slash line of .258/.320/.399, all three considerably lower than their home marks.</p>\n<p>To SMC’s credit, it has a 17-7 home record and has won eight of its last 11 games when staying in Moraga, California.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos want to win their sixth road game of the year and show some improvement as this disappointing season ends, then they will need great performances from their young freshman.</p>\n<p>Besides Brecht, UCSB has certainly had other first-year players step into a role and thrive. The biggest example of this is right fielder / second baseman, Armani Smith. The do-it-all man at times for the Gauchos has been exceptional at the plate as he is currently tied for second in batting average with a .299 average.</p>\n<p>In his last four games, Smith has driven in four runs and is 5 for 16 at the plate while also scoring two runs. The freshman recently hit the second home run of his career in the Gauchos last series against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Sitting right behind Smith in batting average is redshirt freshman Tommy Jew. The outfielder has been tremendous on defense for Santa Barbara currently has a .980 fielding percentage, and has only committed two errors on the year. His 100 putouts on the season rank him third on the team.</p>\n<p>At the plate, Jew struggled against UC Davis registering only no hits in nine total at-bats through the course of the three-game series. However, before that, the center fielder had hit successfully in 17 straight games, something he will look to get back to starting today.</p>\n<p>Despite the rough and disappointing year, UCSB still has the opportunity to end the season in a way that it can look back and not feel so lost.</p>\n<p>The future is still bright in Santa Barbara with all these freshmen who are stepping up and juniors who will most likely elect to stay for their senior campaign.
