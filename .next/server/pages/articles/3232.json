Since 2010, the Patriots have averaged over 30 points per game every season, a mark they’ve reached just twice this season (and never topped), averaging fewer than 23 points through the first eight games.</p>\n<p>However, there seemed to be a clear shift in New England’s performance on Sunday, with the Patriots looking as dangerous as ever behind Brady’s 432-yard, four-touchdown performance. With Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola appearing to be fully healthy, Sunday’s offensive dominance was a sign of things to come for New England.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>New England was missing its two best receiving options without Gronkowski and Amendola for the beginning of the season, and Brady’s numbers reflected the lack of offensive weapons. Brady topped 300 yards once in the first eight games and never threw more than two touchdown passes in any one game.</p>\n<p>With Gronk and Amendola fully healthy, Brady no longer had to rely on the likes of Julian Edelman, undrafted rookie Kenbrell Thompkins and Aaron Dobson to be the primary pass catchers. Dobson has proven to be a valuable rookie receiver and will blossom now that defenders’ focus will shift to Amendola and Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Amendola is one of the top slot receivers in the game and his shiftiness and ability to create space gives Brady plenty of options in the middle of the field. Gronkowski is as deadly of a weapon deep and in the middle as anyone in the game and Dobson has showed signs as a dangerous deep threat with breakaway speed.</p>\n<p>Add in a versatile Edelman and a balanced running attack with weapons such as Stevan Ridley and the injured, but expected to return soon, Shane Vereen, and the Patriots maintain a balanced and dangerous offensive attack. Defenses will certainly have trouble slowing down the many options Brady has at his disposal.</p>\n<p>Some may question how much merit can be put into New England’s offensive performance against a lowly Steelers squad that has struggled mightily this season. Sure, New England’s 610-yard performance (the third-most in franchise history) may have been aided by Pittsburgh’s defensive ineptitude. But give credit where it is due: The Patriots were absolutely dominant on Sunday, and any offense that features Tom Brady throwing to such formidable targets as Gronkowski and Amendola can’t be as bad as what the Patriots put on the field early this season.</p>\n<p>Despite their offensive struggles, New England has still found a way to win, entering the halfway point of the season atop the AFC East standings and holding the fourth-best record in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Barring further injury to offensive personnel, the Patriots are once again positioned for a run at Super Bowl title. Other teams such as Kansas City and Denver may have performed better up to this point in the season, but New England presents as dangerous an option as any to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. The Patriots are on a short list of teams that can realistically challenge the Broncos as the expected AFC Super Bowl representative.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/","id":3232,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3231,3230,3229],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"He Said, He Said: Too Early to Tell if the Broncos are Historically Elite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Manning.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Are the Denver Broncos one of the best teams ever?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Denver Broncos are the odds-on favorites to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl at this point in the season, and are arguably the top team in the entire NFL right now.

However, until that week, I’m arguing the Broncos have a slight, yet clear, edge over Seattle, Indianapolis and San Francisco as the top team in the league.</p>\n<p>What I will argue though, is that Peyton Manning is by far the best quarterback in the league right now, setting an NFL record for the most touchdown passes (20) during the first five games of the season. On Sunday, Manning passed Dan Marino for second all-time in career passing yards and is about 10,000 behind leader Brett Favre. Manning will most definitely go down as one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, and if he can keep up his elite performance level, and even add a Super Bowl victory or two to his resume, that stock will go even higher.</p>\n<p>For all of the Broncos’ ability in the pass game, Denver has a somewhat questionable running game, with no real dominant running back. While that may not be an issue when looking at the history of recent Super Bowl champions, the lack of a back that is capable of racking up 100 yards on a weekly basis could develop into an issue.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Denver gives up a ton of yards through the air, as evidenced by Romo’s performance this past week. But the return of Von Miller from suspension should aid in the Broncos pressuring opposing quarterbacks and forcing them to get rid of the ball before they locate an open receiver.</p>\n<p>If I had to make a call right now, I’d select Denver to defeat Seattle in the Super Bowl this season, but injuries happen, and if a team gets hot at the right time, like the Ravens last season, all predictions are thrown out the window, especially after only five weeks of the season.</p>\n<p>I’m saying that Denver is elite, but historically average, as many other teams in the history of football had fewer weak spots and areas of concern than the Broncos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-08/he-said-he-said-too-early-to-tell-if-the-broncos-are-historically-elite/","id":3229,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3228,3227,3226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Down But Never Out: Leah Sully Battles Back from Injury","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Volleyball-v-CSUN_10.07.2012_Kenneth-Song-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Leah Sully Battled Back From a Torn ACL","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There are a select few injuries in sports that every athlete can only hope they never have to experience. Breaking bones can be pretty bad, and rupturing an Achilles can end your career, but one of the more common dreaded injuries is a torn ACL. The increasingly prevalent season-ending knee injury can happen to anyone at anytime, ending a promising season or even a career in a flash.</p>\n<p>Some players never come back from tearing their ACL. Those who do usually find it difficult to perform at the same level they did prior to the injury. Players tend to come back a little slow at first, and it usually takes some time before anyone can really say what long-term effects the injury has had on them.</p>\n<p>Leah Sully, co-captain of the UCSB women’s volleyball team, is one of those players who didn’t play at the same level she was at before tearing her ACL.

She was third on the team with 223 kills and led the entire Big West with 52 service aces. In the only NCAA tournament appearance of her college career against St. Mary’s, she posted a then-career-high 20 digs.</p>\n<p>“Her first year she was a tremendous impact player,” Gregory said. “Her hitting was good, but that wasn’t the most important thing. She was a great all-around player. Her passing, defense and serving were what was really good.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the first match of her sophomore season, Leah came down with the injury that ended her year just as it began.</p>\n<p>“It was tough because I was excited to have a good season and it’s just a hard thing to cope with in the beginning,” Sully said. “Once I got over that initial hump though, I was just trying to work hard at rehab and push myself to get back as quick as I could.”</p>\n<p>Her coach, however, looked only at the positives that she believed would come from an injury of such magnitude.</p>\n<p>“As difficult as it is to go through an injury, there’s always a silver lining,” Gregory said. “She sat out a year and her hitting got better and better, and by the last year I coached she was the go-to hitter. She really developed her all-around game.”</p>\n<p>While most athletes fear that knee injuries will hinder their physical abilities in a more general sense, when it comes to a sport like volleyball, players and coaches are more concerned with one thing in particular: jumping. Sully made it a point to battle her way into peak physical form before the start of the next season and prove that that would not be an issue.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to improve my vertical,” Sully said. “That was the biggest thing, and I ended up gaining two inches when I came back to the team.”</p>\n<p>Since coming back from her injury, Sully has led the Gauchos in total kills, digs and aces, further solidifying her reputation as an all-around player. She has earned All-Big West First Team honors, she’s placed her name all over the UCSB record books, and she will surely hit many more statistical milestones before her time is done. Despite all of these accomplishments though, there are still a few goals that have continued to elude her.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I would like to go as far in NCAA as possible,” Sully said. “But a Big West title would be huge.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a difficult preseason this year, going 5-7, but they received some bad news before their first conference game of the season when an MRI showed that Sully had a sprained ligament in her elbow. As the team’s top outside hitter, it wasn’t a very good time for her to be forced to sit out games for the first time since her ACL tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch moved Sully to libero; a position where she could play without risking further injury, but also one which she had never before started at in college. Since that decision, UCSB has gone on a tremendous 5-1 run to start their Big West campaign, highlighted by an incredible road win over No. 9 Hawaii in which Sully had a game-high 22 digs.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of what position she’s playing, she’s trying to win at everything,” Sully’s teammate senior opposite Katey Thompson said. “There’s always this intensity and heart to play 100 percent, to just leave it all out there.”</p>\n<p>Thompson perhaps knows better than anybody what Sully went through while rehabilitating her ACL because she too was sidelined for the majority of the 2009 season with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>“After she came back, her mindset completely changed, and she was more driven than ever,” Thompson said. “Her mindset is just so aggressive, she wants to win so badly and she’ll do whatever it takes and play whatever position she’s assigned to.”</p>\n<p>During her time as a Gaucho, Sully has excelled in everything she’s been tasked with doing on the court. Since tearing her ACL, she became the team’s number one hitter, she has been a calming force on the defense whether she’s playing libero or any other position, and she’s become a true leader for her teammates both on and off the court. Not surprisingly, she can owe much of her success to the time she was forced to spend off the court.</p>\n<p>“That knee injury was really inspirational for me because I had never had a serious injury before,” Sully said. “Just always having that in the back of my mind, every day when I come into practice there’s times when I think about it and how I couldn’t play for so long. It really makes you want to practice every day as hard as you can.”</p>\n<p>The silver lining that Coach Gregory foresaw may just be the reason why Leah Sully has, and will continue to be one of the best women’s volleyball players that UCSB has ever been lucky to call a Gaucho.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52583\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52583\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/down-but-never-out-leah-sully-battles-back-from-injury/","id":3230,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3229,3228,3227],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Indianapolis Colts: A Force to be Reckoned With","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With Andrew Luck at Quarterback, the Colts Will Be Great for Many Years to Come","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Indianapolis Colts are a dynasty in the making in the NFL and will place amongst the top teams in the league for years to come. This all starts at quarterback for the Colts, with second-year player Andrew Luck running the offense. Make no mistake: Luck is a franchise quarterback and one of the top prospects to come out of the draft in the last decade.</p>\n<p>Think about how incredibly lucky the Colts franchise has been in finding itself at the top of the draft board with “once-in-a-decade” quarterbacks at the top of the list in Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. While Indianapolis may have sacrificed the opportunity to win a Super Bowl now by allowing Manning to leave town, the Colts have set themselves up for the potential to win Super Bowls years after Manning retires with Luck at the helm.</p>\n<p>Luck has the accuracy and arm strength to stretch the field and keep defenders honest. However, one of the things that really separates Luck from prototypical quarterbacks is his athleticism. If you’ve ever seen Luck play, you know he has some wheels and can shake off a defender down the field or in the pocket.

Richardson may not be living up to expectations thus far in his career, but he is still one of the most dangerous young backs in the league, finishing last season with 1,317 total yards and 12 total touchdowns, an impressive total for a first-year running back.</p>\n<p>With the combination of Luck and Richardson in the Colts’ backfield, Indianapolis possesses two premiere, young offensive weapons, and the Colts have the opportunity to allow Richardson and Luck to pick apart defenses and establish one of the most balanced attacks in the game.</p>\n<p>Complementing Luck and Richardson is a trio of pass catchers that help to stretch the field. Receiver Reggie Wayne has had the opportunity of playing with both Manning and Luck and is still a dangerous and productive wideout despite his age. Wayne is one of the most underrated and consistent receivers in the NFL in the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>Wayne may be near the twilight of his career, but fellow receiver T.Y. Hilton is just getting started. The second-year pro finished his rookie campaign with over 800 yards receiving and seven touchdowns. Through five games this season, Hilton is on track to register a 1,000-yard season and is establishing himself as a dangerous down the field option.</p>\n<p>Finishing out this trio is second-year tight end Coby Fleener, Luck’s former teammate while at Stanford. Fleener may not be as established as Hilton, and seems to disappear at times, but the rapport with Luck is there and he is still projected to finish with six touchdowns and nearly 600 receiving yards this season. Fleener gives Luck a viable option over the middle of the field and is a talented receiver in goal line situations.</p>\n<p>If you notice many second-year players amongst the Colts’ offense, that’s because this is an extremely young squad. All of these players will have a chance to grow together as a unit and become one of the top units in the league.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Colts are paced by the ageless Robert Mathis, who leads the NFL with 9.5 sacks entering Monday night’s game against the Chargers.</p>\n<p>The Colts aren’t a flashy team, but they find ways to win, and against tough competition, too. Already this season, Indianapolis had impressive wins over San Francisco and Seattle, two teams many projected as the top squads in the league entering the season. Indianapolis is showing it has the team to compete now, as they made the playoffs last season as a wild-card team.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most telling game of the season for the Colts will be a Week Seven matchup when they host Manning and the undefeated Denver Broncos, thought to be the best team in the NFL this season. The results from this game will give the NFL a better idea of just how close the Colts are towards taking that next step from playoff team to Super Bowl contender.</p>\n<p>If the Colts are winning these games now with such a young roster, imagine what they can do three years down the road when all their personnel reaches the early prime of their careers. The Colts are already a scary team; I can’t imagine how much scarier they will become if all their players develop as expected. Indianapolis is once again a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-15/the-indianapolis-colts-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/","id":3231,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3230,3229,3228],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
