The Rainbow Wahine are looking to bounce back after a road loss to Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB will hope to defeat Hawai’i for the fourth time in a row, as Hawai’i’s last win over Santa Barbara took place in the 2015-2016 season.</p>\n<p>Crucial to UCSB’s success in the Big West this season has been redshirt senior Drew Edelman. The 6’4” forward is averaging a double-double in conference play with 16.9 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 60.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>In addition to her offensive efficiency, Edelman has scored in double figures against Big West opponents in all but two games this season.</p>\n<p>“I told her a few weeks ago just how proud I was of her,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Just being able to maintain poise and composure because she gets a lot of attention, a lot of traffic, a lot of physicality. She’s done a really good job of handling that pressure and not playing backwards because of a missed call or bad call.”</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ home victory over Riverside, Edelman led her team with 27 points, tying her season high for points in a single game. Luckily for UCSB, Edelman’s other 27-point game this season came against none other than Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>In their visit to the Thunderdome on Feb. 3, the Rainbow Wahine were outrebounded 32-26 by the Gauchos and outscored in the paint 42-27, a sign of Edelman’s significant paint presence on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>A concern for the Gauchos will be whether or not they can replicate their efficient shooting against Hawai’i, since Santa Barbara shot 48 percent overall, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 90 percent from the free-throw line in the last meeting.</p>\n<p>For Hawai’i, disrupting UCSB’s offense early and limiting Edelman’s paint touches will be key, but the Rainbow Wahine have a weapon of their own: Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>In her senior season, guard Toeaina is averaging 16 points per game and 6.1 rebounds per contest while shooting 51.5 percent overall from the field. Toeaina scored 25 points in Hawai’i’s latest visit to the Thunderdome, and the senior has drawn high praise from coach Henrickson.</p>\n<p>“She’s a kid who really competes. She’s composed and has a great mid-range game. She gets on the offensive glass and gets out in transition, so we’ve got our hands full, we’ve got to be prepared.” Henrickson said. “We need to limit where they like to catch it, what shots they like to get, where they’re most efficient and be more disruptive in that action. She leads the league in free-throw attempts, she’s coming off a game where she had 19 against Long Beach State. That’s not the answer because now she’s scoring while she’s resting.”</p>\n<p>Toeaina will certainly be a tough assignment for the Santa Barbara guards and help defenders; however, one of UCSB’s freshman guards, Sarah Bates, has drawn praise from her head coach as well.</p>\n<p>Averaging 13.6 points per game in Big West competition, Bates is the Gauchos’ second-leading scorer and knocks down 43.8 percent of shots from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“In a role where she’s played a ton of minutes, and we’ve needed her to do a lot of different things for us,” Henrickson said. “She’s been able to step up and answer that which has been important for us.”</p>\n<p>With the Big West Tournament scheduled for next week, Thursday’s game marks the last of the regular season, but UCSB remains focused on what’s next.</p>\n<p>“This time of the year we’re just trying to eliminate game slippage and understand what our responsibilities are to find success,” Henrickson said. “We want to build momentum off the other night and build momentum getting a road win and be able to get as many conference wins before the tournament since we’ve been here, which is a little milestone for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on Hawai’i on Thursday, March 1, with tip-off scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 1,</em><em> 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81683\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81683\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/","id":950,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[949,948,947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift","biography":"Not available","articles":[32,33,42,202,203,206,218,221,598,603,655,675,681,691,696,747,770,781,819,837,838,846,865,898,938,944,945,946,950,969,997,1209,1212,1213,1214,1330,1836,1849,1871,4876,4887,4890,4908,4909,4910,4911,4912,4913,4914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gaucho-Mania: MBB Carries 7-Game Streak Into LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Holding on to first place in the Big West is one of the main priorities for the UCSB men's basketball team.

The road to the NCAA Tournament will likely go through at least one of these three teams, after all.</p>\n<p>The first two teams on the schedule, Long Beach State and UC Davis, are both locked in a three-way tie with Cal State Fullerton for third place in the Big West. They are behind the Gauchos and the Anteaters, respectively.</p>\n<p>First up are the Long Beach State 49ers, who have struggled against their peers in the Big West standings. The 49ers are 1-4 in games against UCD, UCI and CSUF, with the lone win coming against the Titans back in January.</p>\n<p>Those four losses make up the entirety of Long Beach’s conference blemishes.</p>\n<p>The 49ers are 7-4 in the Big West, and they have suffered from some bad luck with three single-digit losses.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Long Beach game plan revolves around transfer senior Gabe Levin. The 6-7 forward is averaging a team-high 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in around 30 minutes of action a night.</p>\n<p>Levin has outright led the 49ers in scoring in all but two of their Big West games, and is leading the conference in scoring in Big West play. Unsurprisingly, the senior is key to Long Beach success, and is a common focal point for defenses.</p>\n<p>Opposing defenses can afford to focus on Levin because his supporting cast hasn’t done much to make them pay for doing so.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have four players – Max Heidegger, Jalen Canty, Leland King II and Gabe Vincent – between Levin and his next closest teammate in conference scoring.</p>\n<p>Part of that is due to junior transfer guard Bryan Alberts’s nine-game absence due to injury, but the Gonzaga transfer has been slow to readjust since returning to the lineup four games ago.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Temidayo Yussuf has stepped up to give the 49ers another low post threat, and put up a 17 point, 11 rebound double-double in his most recent game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host the Gauchos on Thursday, which plays to a major advantage for a Long Beach State team that is 7-4 at the Walter Pyramid and just 5-8 in away games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be able road warriors with a 7-5 away record, including a major win in Davis over the Aggies most recently.</p>\n<p>That win last Thursday is what propelled UCSB to their solitary perch atop the standings, but it’s unlikely to be a comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Even if the Gauchos are able to fight off the 49ers on Thursday, they’ll then have to take on the Aggies once more on Saturday, this time in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>With a home winning streak of 11 games to start the season, the longest such run in school history, the Gauchos have reason to feel confident even against such formidable and motivated guests as the Aggies.</p>\n<p>In the first matchup, UCSB controlled much of the game, aside from a strong stretch run by UC Davis to make things close late in the game. Junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, receiving extra minutes in the absence of Canty, was instrumental late in the game with eight points, all in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to overcome Canty’s absence due to a suspension for violating team rules, but the team has made no announcements on the timetable for his return. Barring a change in status before Thursday, UCSB will likely have to adapt once again.</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos were able to do so thanks to a balanced team offensive effort. Four players finished in double-digits, with Leland King II leading the way with 19 points and 15 rebounds, his fifth double-double of Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t be the only team dealing with a mysterious and impactful suspension on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCD’s star forward, Chima Moneke, has missed the team’s last three games after being sent home prior to the team’s Feb. 3 game against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are 2-0 without their suspended forward, the Aggies have struggled a bit more, going 1-2 while sliding down from first place in the Big West to a tie for third.</p>\n<p>The reasons and timetable for Moneke’s return are still up in the air, so it’s quite possible both teams will once again be shorthanded on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Junior guard TJ Shorts II has stepped up in Moneke’s absence with almost 27 points per game in the last three games. Junior Siler Schneider has also taken on an expanded role, but the Aggies haven’t been able to fully replicate Moneke’s production.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a tough midterms week ahead of them, with two games against teams with a combined conference record of 14-8.</p>\n<p>A successful week however, would cement the team’s status as the one to best in Big West play, and push UCSB past 20 wins for the first time since 2009-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Long Beach State on Thursday in Long Beach at 7 p.m. The ’Chos then host UC Davis in the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 15 of the Feb. 15</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/","id":947,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[946,945,944],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Puts 3-Game Win Streak on the Line Against Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following three straight conference wins, UCSB will hope to take out its bitter green rival Cal Poly and take control of third place in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81172\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"256722274\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81190\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81172\" data-attachment-id=\"81172\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/drea-toler-slides-around-the-defense-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drea Toler slides around the defense.

She averaged 16 points and 11.5 rebounds in her two games last week.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, Edelman wasn’t alone in achieving a double-double against UCI, as redshirt senior Drea Toler also managed to earn a double-double. Dishing out 10 dimes and scoring a commanding 10 points, Toler was on fire.</p>\n<p>Following the win, the Gauchos are currently 11-14 overall and 8-5 in the Big West. They are also winners of three straight games. The outcome of the game places UCSB one game closer to second-seeded UC Irvine in the standings.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, Santa Barbara is in third place in the Big West, tied with Cal Poly, their next opponent.</p>\n<p>This upcoming game has serious conference contentions, as it gives either team the opportunity to be the lone third seed and to inch closer to the two-seed spot.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will be hosting Santa Barbara as they come off a loss from Cal State Northridge, where they fell 86-66, but not from a lack of effort.</p>\n<p>There are some dangerous players on the Mustangs, and UCSB will need to be on high alert for their balanced attack.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Dynn Leaupepe scored a monster 29 points in the last game for Cal Poly and averages 25.5 points per game during conference play on 46 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Her offensive approach is a potent one and is something the Gauchos will have to guard against if they want to contain their opponent.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch out for is senior guard Lynn Leaupepe. Grabbing seven rebounds in the last game versus Cal State Northridge, L. Leaupepe has over 30 offensive rebounds and 50 defensive rebounds in recent conference games, averaging six rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Boxing out and grabbing boards is going to have a major impact on Cal Poly’s game versus USCB, so it will be interesting to see how the Gauchos match Cal Poly’s intensity under the basket. In their last game, Cal Poly shot 41.2 percent from the field on 28-for-68 shooting.</p>\n<p>Their offense fell flat in the third quarter, which is where CSUN began to run away. If the Mustangs keep their foot on the gas with their normal scoring attack, they will be a tough opponent to beat.</p>\n<p>Averaging 65 points per game on 40.6 percent shooting, the Gauchos will face a worthy opponent in the Mustangs, who average 70 points per game on 39.8 percent shooting. Two equally matched opponents with a lot to play for.</p>\n<p>Look out for the bench play on both teams. Santa Barbara usually has a superior bench in comparison to their opponents, their reserves often making worthy contributions to the game.</p>\n<p>Not to be dismissed, though, is the bench play of Cal Poly. The home team also has a great bench, which was evident in their last bout, where the reserves put 37 points on the board.</p>\n<p>Both benches match up nicely, and their head-to-head battle will be a big influence on the outcome of the game. This will be a Blue-Green Rivalry game to remember, as both teams have serious consquences on the line.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 21, at the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81190\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81190\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-20/gauchos-puts-3-game-win-streak-on-the-line-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":948,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[947,946,945],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Comes from Behind in Exciting Senior Day Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WBball_vsCSUF-180215-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos improved to 9-6 in Big West play following a victory over CSUN in their final home game of the regular season.

Curry racked up an amazing double-double, scoring a game-high 31 points and 14 rebounds, while Holt had a well-rounded 5 rebounds and 5 assists to go along with her 21-point performance.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another dominating double-double night, draining a team-high 27 points, and grabbing 14 boards, which was tied with Riverside’s Curry for the most in the game.</p>\n<p>With just under 9 minutes left to play in regulation, UCSB trailed by 11, the score sitting at 53-42 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter began to heat up for the Gauchos, as Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar combined for an explosive 25 of the team’s 32 points in the last quarter. Despite their valiant effort, though, the home team still trailed by six, the score 68-62 with only 41 seconds left to play.</p>\n<p>Sahar scored a clutch three-pointer from beyond the arc, and after the opponents scored, Sahar attempted to drain another shot from downtown, but was fouled and knocked down all three free throw attempts, to bring the game to 69-68, UCSB behind by just 1 point.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders were fouled and scored just one of their two free throws, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter passed the ball to Edelman who had a good look and shot the ball in to tie the game up at 70, with just 8 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Curry attempted a shot to take the game for UCR, but the shot fell out of bounds, possession then belonging to the home team.</p>\n<p>It looked as if the Gauchos would be set up to play their first overtime game since the 2014-2015 season, but that turned out to not be the case.</p>\n<p>While regulation seemingly ended with the score tied up at 70-70, the officials put 1.5 seconds back on the game clock after review.</p>\n<p>That last second and a half was sufficient enough for the home team to get the walk off win.</p>\n<p>Toler inbounded the pass to freshman guard Sarah Bates who was fouled and forced to leave the game after being injured on the play.</p>\n<p>Coming in to complete the play by shooting her free throws, Bates knocked in both attempts, allowing UCSB to win the game without extra OT minutes.</p>\n<p>It was a special night in the Thunderdome, as the 27 points for Edelman are tied for her career-high, with this being her sixth double-double in the last seven games.
