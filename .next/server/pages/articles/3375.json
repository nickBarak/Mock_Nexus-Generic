It’s all done. The cash is in the bank.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, the donation would serve to provide a place for physicists from around the world to convene on campus.</p>\n<p>“This donation is to provide a residence for these most important physicists in the world that come to UCSB all the time to these conferences where they interchange ideas about physics and so on, and helping that program which I greatly admire,” Munger said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, creating a space for world-class physicists to meet and conduct research is imperative to scientific progress.</p>\n<p>“These programs where visiting physicists get together are a very old thing in the world,” Munger said. “Remember Einstein and Madam Curie and all those people? [They] used to meet in Belgium in the twenties. It has always been important that these great physicists get together.”</p>\n<p>Munger also said the university is the best possible place to host top-notch scientists.</p>\n<p>“The achievements of UCSB are so great, that now the one place where they all come is UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s by far the most important gathering place for the best physicists in the world, they’re there all the time, they have program after program all year long.”</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his donation toward scientific progress will help bolster what he views as a suffering nationwide public school system.</p>\n<p>“I regret that the public school system, which was pretty good when I was young, has had such enormous deterioration in our central cities. Some of the most brilliant minds in the country have tried to fix that and have had great trouble with it,” Munger said. “That’s why I give to visiting physicists. I know that will work.”</p>\n<p>Charles Munger III, Munger’s grandson and UCSB alumnus, said his grandfather has been involved with the university for several years.</p>\n<p>“He actually gave a talk back in 2007 or 2006 before I applied to UCSB and I’ve been going up and hanging out in Santa Barbara for quite a while,” Munger III said.</p>\n<p>According to Munger, his grandson’s attendance was not his sole reason for donating.</p>\n<p>“I am very grateful for the great education that my grandson had, but I gave them the money because I so admire the program that brings all these visiting physicists to UCSB,” Munger said. “It’s the most important program of that kind in the world, and number two is not close.”</p>\n<p>With regards to his grandfather, Munger III said that his affiliation with Munger’s reputation is “an honor.”</p>\n<p>“He’s known for having high integrity, for being really honest and honorable, not really for screwing anyone over,” Munger III said. “It does make it a lot easier. When people say ‘Charles Munger,’ it’s never anything bad. It’s always like ‘What a fantastic person.’”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/billionaire-donates-over-65-million-to-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/billionaire-donates-over-65-million-to-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/billionaire-donates-over-65-million-to-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/billionaire-donates-over-65-million-to-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/billionaire-donates-over-65-million-to-ucsb/","id":3375,"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr"},"related":[3374,3373,3372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr","biography":"Not available","articles":[2988,3375,4806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

CSD. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) is including the Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC) under its payroll as a parent organization, but the IVCC will continue to fund itself independently from the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it lost its funding, IVCC has been unable to provide stipends to its 10 management and shift positions. Students have continued to work for IVCC on a volunteer basis this academic year, but IVCC has stalled compost collection to the 96 homes it currently serves and cannot expand to the 100 homes currently on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization was created in Fall Quarter 2017 by current IVCC director and fourth-year environmental science major Jacob Bider, who conceived the idea of a grassroots-level composting group in I.V. when he moved out of on-campus housing after his freshman year and realized there was no composting in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider applied for an internship at the Santa Barbara chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and in his application proposed a student-led composting program to I.V. He and other Surfrider interns then began developing the composting initiative, which officially began in Winter Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents in I.V. can apply for composting buckets at their homes to be picked up weekly by IVCC dirtriders –– student workers for IVCC who pick up the bins each week, sort and deliver compost to gardens around I.V. and then bring the buckets back to people’s homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC started in Winter Quarter 2018 by serving approximately 10 homes and proceeded to double in size by the next quarter. A grant from the Coastal Fund in Spring Quarter 2018 allowed them to continue expanding, and by Fall Quarter 2019, IVCC was providing compost services to 96 homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC’s past three years of growth began stalling at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019 when Surfrider notified IVCC that shift workers like dirtriders were not allowed to be paid under a stipend and had to be paid by the hour instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider said in an interview that the amount dirtriders receive on a stipend is equal to minimum wage, and that the decision to have stipends was proposed in its original funding with the Coastal Fund, but that they have now expanded beyond that model’s capacity. Surfrider told IVCC that they needed to switch their shift workers from stipends to payroll, but as a nonprofit, Surfrider didn’t have the capacity to do so. As a result, IVCC dissolved its relationship with Surfrider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main problem the IVCC faced was its lack of a parent organization; the program didn’t need funding, Bider explained — it has a development team that works to apply for grant funding to help it expand operations. But in order to apply for any funding and put employees on a payroll system, it needed a larger organization to be a part of.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC then turned to the Office of Student Life (OSL) to absorb it but found it couldn’t put their shift workers on any payroll system. IVCC also reached out to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) but were told that “due to various policies, A.S. cannot take on the program,” Bider said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider also spoke with Katie Maynard, event manager and coordinator of UCSB Sustainability, and was told that they were already spread too thin and could not take on the payroll for the IVCC; when IVCC tried reaching out to the Department of Environmental Studies, it was told that it’s “not in the nature” of an academic department to take on a project like the IVCC, Bider said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC then reached out to MarBorg Industries, a waste management company that collects residential and other compost. Currently, 20% of the compost collected by IVCC goes to MarBorg in order to prevent overflow of the three gardens that collect compost in I.V., according to Bider. MarBorg also told IVCC that it was unable to take on the group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But throughout the talks with various departments, Bider said there was a recurring name: the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re seeking a partner that can provide us with institutional longevity and because [the I.V. CSD is] a governmental institution with paid staff and a board, you can provide us with that,” he said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director George Thurlow suggested moving the conversation along to the next agenda item in the same vein: discussion regarding the possibility of composting bins at the Isla Vista Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, MarBorg Industries offered to supply the community center with two free composting bins for six months. MarBorg stressed the importance of having the bins strictly managed; if the bins were open 24/7, people could toss in non-compostable items and render the compost useless, Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the option of having bins at the community center, the I.V. CSD began discussing ways for the IVCC to take part in providing a compost service in I.V. — something that combines the IVCC and the possibility of bins at the community center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Jay Freeman drafted a motion to direct staff to draft a memorandum of understanding between the IVCC and I.V. CSD for potential composting services for I.V., while authorizing the IVCC to approach organizations for possible sources of funding. The motion passed 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the IVCC has been stuck in a waiting period this academic year while searching for a new organization, students have continued their work on a volunteer basis. IVCC recently implemented a composting event service, where groups can apply on the IVCC website for composting at its events. IVCC also partnered with A.S. to hold a non-perishable food drive called Food on Wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as we want to communicate the struggles we’ve been through, we also want to communicate the fact that we’re still here and we’re really ready to get back into running and we have some things that we’re excited to promote too,” Ily Logeais, IVCC marketing and communications manager, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logeais said it was important for IVCC to find a group like the I.V.

Yang in 1998. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1998 demands called for the establishment of an LGBTQ+ resource center as well as a building in which to house the newly created organization and were meant to address the needs of LGBTQ+ students and provide more services and education, in addition to a space on campus for LGBTQ+ students. These demands ultimately resulted in the creation of the RCSGD in October 1999.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> called for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to be separate from the jurisdiction of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that their umbrella organization did not treat them fairly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the RCSGD’s programming budget to be doubled and for the designation of a freestanding building for the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the demands called for a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding Muro’s termination; the RCSGD and the WGSE disagreed about the extent of police presence during Muro’s firing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately, the RCSGD was removed from underneath the umbrella of the WGSE, and its programming budget was doubled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne Mosbey, the programming coordinator of the RCSGD, said the center has seen an almost sixfold increase in growth between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019. In addition, event attendance has doubled in the same timeframe across 72 programs, which he pointed to as a sign of the program’s expansion.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also discussed the RCSGD’s work in expanding its reach through collaborations with 22 various services and organizations, including Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ampus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and the MultiCultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What this implies is that our center now has connections all throughout campus. So for students who find some of these services that are inaccessible on their own, we’re able to connect them with those resources,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now two years later, with the majority of the 2017 demands met by the university, the largest and most costly demand is the last one left: the designation of a free-standing building for the RCSGD, which is currently housed in the Student Resource Building (SRB).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was one demand put on the list that we discussed with students at the time was going to take a while and [there] would be a much longer process [to it] than the other ones,” said Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion centered around how the RCSGD could go about either repurposing a building on campus, constructing a new building, creating multiple centers in various places in order to spread services across campus or even designate a location outside the bounds of the university in order to better serve members of the wider Goleta and Santa Barbara community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead suggested constructing a building to serve the aggregate needs of several organizations on campus. The Black Student Union has been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a freestanding center for Black students on campus for over 50 years; in March 2019, Yang agreed to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the creation of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/inaugural-director-of-the-office-of-black-student-development-hired-fulfilling-bsu-demand/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of Black Student Development</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and to make the standalone building a priority in campus planning efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have several groups, like the Office of Black Student Development, the Monarch Lounge; we’d like them to have some really nice space and then [it’d] probably be more cost effective to have another SRB for these groups.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also discussed the possibility of establishing a location off-campus to serve as the RCSGD building, as well as potentially partnering with the Pacific Pride Foundation, an organization that provides “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides services to the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ+ communities of Santa Barbara County,” according to its </span><a href=\"https://pacificpridefoundation.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leets, the RCSGD director, said the center could also establish temporary spaces on campus, which could be used by the RCSGD to provide better accessibility to students living in the Chi-5 residence halls and the eastern ends of campus, near the engineering building, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know when I first got here, we had been talking about Isla Vista as where we needed more space, but I’ve noticed that here we seem to have some claim on this side of campus [near the SRB]. But I wonder about the middle of campus where Chi-5 is, and then the other side of campus,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, where the engineering buildings are, I went there for the first time this summer. So like a year into my job here, I had never been over to that side of campus. I think we’re trying to think about how we can have temporary space in those places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexia Duran, a second-year undeclared student, suggested that the RCSGD allow students to have 24/7 access to the center “just for it to be a more accessible space for students,” citing the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“El Centro is open 24/7 and I’ve been there at 3 a.m. and I see people… [who] don’t have a house and students sometimes have to sleep on the couch. Having a space that would provide that for LGBTQ people would be necessary,” Duran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said the RCSGD could also be moved into a number of soon-to-be-vacated sites closer to the center of campus, allowing for greater accessibility and interconnectedness with the Chi-5 dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a couple years down the road, but the university is in the process of moving some of the offices that are in the center of campus, and don’t need to be on the center of campus, off-campus. And that’s going to create some more space,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, several attendees objected to that idea, arguing that the buildings in that portion of campus were both old and in an undesirable state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You look at the Monarch Lounge, like it’s a pretty poor excuse for how we serve undocumented students. It’s a glorified portable, and relocating the RCSGD towards the center of campus will be probably within that space,” said Esmeralda Quintero, a third-year political science and sociology double major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said that feasibility will be considered in the decision, but that support from students will be the deciding factor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not moving the RCSGD at all without student support,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have an exact plan? No. However, things are moving because of new development that’s happening. And so starting to identify our needs now will serve us well so that we can slide in and start moving towards a space that is going to be open in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The obvious one, to those native to the crescent city and even to those who aren’t, is the day Hurricane Katrina struck the city on Aug. 23, 2005, and completely destroyed people’s homes, families, livelihoods, and hope.</p>\n<p>Due to the devastating hit the city took from Katrina, about 9,000 people took shelter in the New Orleans Superdome, home to the Saints, who had evacuated beforehand. A place once home to one of the worst franchises in all of sports now became home to people who had been through one of the worst catastrophes imaginable. Even worse, the lack of supplies was so bad many people were left starving and thirsty.</p>\n<p>The state of the Superdome became extremely bad over the next few days due to the breakdown of hygiene, urinals, and plumbing, which left the smell inside the stadium horrible. The outside also went bad as the roof was peeling off and holes were starting to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Due to the state of the Superdome and the severity of the situation, the 2005 Saints played no home games in the dome and played in Baton Rouge Stadium or the Alamodome. Worst of all, their home opener was rescheduled to a Monday night “home” game against the Giants at The Meadowlands, home of the New York Giants. That’s right: The Saints’ “home opener” was scheduled to be played at their opponents’ home stadium, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>\n<p>As the 2005 season went on there were various reports that the owner, Tom Benson, and government officials in San Antonio were working behind the scenes concerning a possible permanent relocation for the Saints to San Antonio. The reports said Benson would get out of his contract by saying the Superdome was no longer adequate to house his team.</p>\n<p>Fans were stunned. By this point they were just trying to get back into a normal lifestyle, and now the team they loved was being taken away from them. Make no mistake; although the Saints were a terrible team for many, many years, they were still loved by the city of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Many fans in Louisiana were angered and felt people in San Antonio were taking advantage of an already desolated city by stealing their franchise. Tensions ran so high that the New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin called Benson’s actions shameful to those who supported the team through about 40 losing seasons.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, once all was said and done, the NFL stated that the Saints would stay in New Orleans and the Superdome would re-open its doors on Sept. 25, 2006, for a Monday night game against the Falcons. Fans were so happy to hear the Saints were staying, that for the first time in franchise history the team sold its entire home schedule to season ticket holders.</p>\n<p>That’s where our second day comes in. The day most embedded into New Orleans culture, whether you are a sports fan or not. The day the crescent city was reborn.</p>\n<p>Very rarely will there be another play that touches the hearts of people not even part of the sports world as much as the blocked punt by Steve Gleason, which was returned for a touchdown after a Falcons three-and-out on their opening drive, now dubbed “Rebirth.” To this day, people swear the Superdome was never as loud as during and after that magical play.</p>\n<p>Those who doubt the importance of one play, especially one such as this, truly do not know the electricity that flowed through the city and their football team thanks to Rebirth. The Saints crushed the Falcons 23-3 that night and went on to have their best season in franchise history, finishing 10-6, clinching a first round bye and reaching their first ever NFC championship game.</p>\n<p>While the Saints’ season in 2006 did not end with a Super Bowl championship, the pieces were set to make a run and eventually win the most coveted game. By comparison, New Orleans as a city was also recovering steadily, but it wasn’t ready to say it was fully back to normal only one year after such a horrible tragedy.</p>\n<p>See, the thing about the Saints and their ties with their city is that as the football team started to become a winner, the crescent city was recovering. It was almost as though the city was lifted through the success of the Saints, which all came to fruition in 2009 when New Orleans was able to see their once loveable losers become champions of the football world.</p>\n<p>Rebirth wasn’t just about a single play in which an athlete made a solid effort. It was not about the players, it was not about the football team and it certainly was not about the touchdown.</p>\n<p>It was about the city coming together and putting its love into a team that was never respected. It was about the beginning of the reshaping that took place as the city moved on from Katrina and the Saints moved on from their horrible past. Both parties were ready to become winners, and now they are.</p>\n<p>When the Saints and Falcons re-took the field 10 years later this past Monday to celebrate the historic event, it really felt like everything had come full circle. Sure, the Saints are not a top team anymore, and, unfortunately, they did lose this past Monday 45-32, but the journey from that night and blocked punt in 2006 until now was truly a spectacle worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>Katrina was one of the worst things that could happen to any city anywhere in the world. It robbed people of many valuable things. But what the Saints and the citizens of New Orleans were able to embody is the ultimate form of resiliency. That’s what makes Rebirth not only special, but certainly worthy of the title given to that blocked punt on that night and worthy of the statue made in its honor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
