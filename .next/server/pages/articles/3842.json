Several of the men had their phones out and were taking pictures.</p>\n<p>The deputies then watched as the inebriated 18-year-old pushed herself up only to slip and fall face first into a pile of her own sick.</p>\n<p>Wiping the vomit from her face, the drunken female righted herself and started to walk off, completely unaware she was being followed by the police.</p>\n<p>A deputy grabbed her by the arm and tried to talk with the puking princess, but she was utterly unaware of her surroundings, making for bad conversation. Given that everyone else had scattered upon their arrival, the officers decided it was best to arrest her and transport her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Parking Lot Blues</b></p>\n<p>Sat. Oct. 17, 2:30 a.m. — Residents of 781 Embarcadero Del Norte were rudely awoken early Saturday morning to the obnoxious antics of one especially intoxicated partier.</p>\n<p>According to the reporting party, the 20-year-old male had stumbled up to the apartment complex, of which he was not a tenant, and then proceeded to kick and bang on several apartment doors.</p>\n<p>The young man’s run as the most insufferable idiot on the block was short lived, however. When officers arrived some minutes later, they found the rambunctious reveler passed out cold in the parking lot behind the building.</p>\n<p>The deputies attempted to rouse the sleepy squatter but he was unable to do anything but crawl around on all fours. And if that weren’t enough proof, the large urine stains on the man’s jeans suggested he was too drunk to take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Despite his self-professed desire to sleep in the parking lot, the officers offered something more comfortable, albeit just barely, and transported the infantile student to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Just a Beer… or 10</b></p>\n<p>Fri. Oct. 16, 11:40 a.m. — After losing his balance and nearly falling to the ground, a lone partier found himself in the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive decided to stop the staggering 18-year-old, whose clothing was soiled with dirt, and check on his welfare.</p>\n<p>The officers inquired into his alcohol consumption for the night, and the blatantly drunk man told them he had barely had anything to drink. His cover was blown, however, when he told the deputies he lived at 3022 Trigo Rd., which, unfortunately, does not exist.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Jail, however, certainly exists and was happy to house the lost boy, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-21/police-blotter-43/","id":3842,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3841,3840,3839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Weekend Crime Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to burglaries, vandalism and several alcohol-related fights this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to burglaries, vandalism and several alcohol-related fights this weekend.</p>\n<p>Early Saturday morning, deputies found a bloodied man at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde Road. IVFP Deputy Freddy Padilla said the individual had passed out in the street after a fight. The victim was rushed to the hospital after brief questioning.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was knocked out cold, and deputies saw blood was on his mouth,” Padilla said. “The officers noted that the victim appeared highly intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>An hour later, deputies responded to another fight that began when an intoxicated man was attacked while sleeping on his couch at home.</p>\n<p>“The victim was passed out on the living room couch,” Padilla said. “An unknown male attacked him while he was on the couch and hit him multiple times in the face.”</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, the fight was instigated earlier in the evening when the victim of the fight assaulted the attacker’s girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“She was at a party and was kneed in the abdomen by the male victim,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Padilla said because the suspect fled the scene after the attack, authorities have been unable to identify him.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to two residential thefts over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Burglars stole a laptop computer from a residence on the 6600 block of Sueno Road at 4 a.m. Saturday morning. Later during the weekend, thieves took a camera, two camera lenses and a watch from a residence on the 6700 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>In both cases, thieves entered through unlocked windows or doors. Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her. Maybe she was being cooperative,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Authorities took the woman’s contact information and plan to ask the owner of the vehicle if they want to press charges at a later date.</p>\n<p>Officers handled a typical number of alcohol-related crimes over the weekend. Eight individuals were arrested for public intoxication and nine were issued minor in possession citations. Deputies also issued 10 citations for possession of open containers.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/","id":3839,"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer"},"related":[3838,3837,3836],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All that glitters is not gold…","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>All that glitters is not gold…</p>\n<p>Friday, May 28, 11:49 p.m. — While Isla Vista’s finest were cruising down the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road in a patrol vehicle, they noticed a male UCSB student lying on top of a bike in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Two girls were helping the 19-year-old off the ground, who had somehow managed to misplace his shirt and was covered with glitter paint across his entire face and body.
