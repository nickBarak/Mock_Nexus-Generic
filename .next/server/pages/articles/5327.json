After losing to top ranked BYU in their previous game, the Gauchos will have a shot at redemption tonight as they face defending national champions No. 1 UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Having been swept by the Anteaters earlier in the season, the Gauchos understand that execution in late game situations will be critical for them to pull out a win this time around.</p>\n<p>“It really came down to one or two plays in the later part of each game that decided that one,” freshman setter Jonah Seif said. “We know they’re beatable, they lost games this year.

Currently in second place in the MPSF, the Anteaters are 10-3 overall and 7-3 in the conference, only losing once at home this season.</p>\n<p>As Irvine is led by All-American senior outside hitter Kevin Tillie, containing the Frenchman will be essential for UCSB to defeat the Anteaters. Ranking 10th in the conference in hitting percentage (.368) and sixth in kills per set (4.00), Tillie had a monster game in the previous match versus Santa Barbara, notching 18 kills with a hitting percentage of .485.</p>\n<p>“Tillie is definitely going to have his plays, we’re not going to be able to shut him down completely,” Seif said. “But definitely if we contain him, it puts a lot of pressure on the other players on their team to come up big.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its best offensive display against BYU. In that game, four Gauchos had double-digit kills, including Evans, whose 21 kills matched a career high. UCSB will need a repeat offensive performance to offset the UCI defense. Nevertheless, defense will still be the primary focus in stopping Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Our block is going to be really important,” Evans said. “Their best player was tipping balls and that’s what we want them to do and we need to pick those up. Now that we know that they do that, we’re ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 14th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-14/ucsb-set-to-take-on-defending-champ-uci/","id":5327,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5326,5325,5324],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Falls in Season Finale to Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Senior night had no happy ending for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

After being ranked as low as 12th place in the MPSF in February, the Gauchos went on a seven-game winning streak in March that propelled them to a first-round matchup in the postseason against UC Irvine on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s kind of a bummer that we had to go out like this like in our last home game but we made playoffs, so that was our goal for the season,” senior outside hitter Grant Goswiller said. “We’re looking strong right now.”</p>\n<p>The Waves finish 14-11 overall and 13-11 in conference and will face UCLA in the first round of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came out strong in the opening moments of the match to take a commanding 10-4 lead in set one. The Waves made an effort to come back but the energy brought by the Gauchos enabled them to win the set 25-20, not giving up the lead the entire frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB once again took an early lead heading into second frame, but Pepperdine was able to even the game at 10 all before pulling ahead and winning the set 25-21. Fueled by a .409 hitting performance in the third game, the Waves won 25-19 to set up game four.</p>\n<p>Down 10-5 in the fourth, the Gauchos rallied behind senior middle blocker and team captain Dylan Davis, who scored six kills in the set and gave UCSB enough momentum to tie the game at 23. However, Pepperdine was able to earn the last two points of the set to outlast the Gauchos 25-23 and win the game 3-1.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t start off too hot but we ended up getting a lot of momentum and tied it back up,” Goswiller said. “The last couple balls just didn’t go our way.”</p>\n<p>Although limiting a majority of the Waves players, sophomore outside hitter Josh Taylor and senior opposite Maurice Torres accounted for 33 of Pepperdine’s 47 kills in the game. The two applied pressure on the Gaucho defense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>In his final regular season game at home, Davis led the way for the Gauchos with an impressive stat line of 10 kills, four digs and a .571 hitting percentage.

It’s really hard for a freshman to come in and make an immediate impact on our league and times that by 10 for a setter to do it,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “A setter has so many more responsibilities and he’s got to run the whole show and run the whole offense.

That’s what you catch right away when you watch him.”</p>\n<p>Already being familiar with UCSB from when he played in a basketball tournament earlier in his life, Seif’s familiarity with the campus as well as his love for the beach and its welcoming atmosphere convinced him UCSB was the right place. Yet Seif didn’t realize his own talents or potential until the latter part of his high school career.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really think I had a shot to play in college until probably just before senior year,” Seif said. “That’s when I realized that I could play in college.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Seif has assumed the role of the team’s starting setter, a position that comes with the responsibility of running the offense and getting the ball to the right hitter.</p>\n<p>With his amount of playing time, Seif has embraced the role of the team’s setter and has made his presence known to the entire conference. Averaging 10.70 assists per set, Seif ranks third in the MPSF in assists per set, and against Pacific, he recorded the first triple-double by a Gaucho this season and had a career-high 55 assists against No. 1 BYU.</p>\n<p>“When you look around the league there’s not a lot of freshmen who are starting their freshman year,” Seif said. “I feel extremely fortunate to be at this level right now and to be where I am.”</p>\n<p>The immediate impact and playing time Seif is having comes as a surprise to Seif himself, as he didn’t even envision playing significant minutes this year.</p>\n<p>“Coming into freshman year I didn’t think I would be getting anywhere close to this [amount of playing time],” Seif said. “I was hoping to be getting some playing time; where I am now is nowhere where I thought I would be a year ago.”</p>\n<p>Now midway through the season, Seif still finds difficulty in adjusting to the college game, especially its speed and the physical pounding the sport has taken on his body. Seif has shown tremendous maturity and relishes the role he has been given — the most difficult one on the team.</p>\n<p>“The hardest thing about being a setter I would say is that a lot of pressure falls on you to make the right play and you touch the ball every time,” Seif said. “There’s a lot of pressure in getting the ball to the right hitter in the right location, but I think that’s what I would say I love most about the position.”</p>\n<p>Besides developing chemistry on the court with his teammates, Seif also focuses on it off the court as he is majoring in chemistry and aspires to excel in the classroom just as much as he does when playing volleyball.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos still in contention for a playoff spot this year, Seif’s playing abilities will be crucial down the stretch, but his impact in later years will certainly not be limited to just his athleticism as he desires to become a team captain and win a championship at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He’s got unbelievable potential, he has not tapped two percent of that potential,” McLaughlin said. “This is a guy that could — if he keeps working hard — end up setting for our Olympic team at some point. We’re just fired up to have him here.”</p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 9  of February 13th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50157\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-13/setting-the-bar-beyond-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50157\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-13/setting-the-bar-beyond-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-13/setting-the-bar-beyond-expectations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-13/setting-the-bar-beyond-expectations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-13/setting-the-bar-beyond-expectations/","id":5325,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5324,5323,5322],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Defending National Champs For Second Straight Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Facing the No. 1 team in the country, the No. 12 UCSB men’s volleyball team was unable to defeat UC Irvine last night on the road, losing 3-1 to the Anteaters for the second time this season.

In its first match, the Gauchos defeated the Tritons 3-1.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to do a whole different lineup or anything major as far as our game plan,” senior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “What’s worked, worked and we’re going to try that again.”</p>\n<p>UCSB allowed three different Triton players to score double-digit kills in its first encounter and realize defense will be critical in stopping its current losing.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we want to do is make sure their best players, or the players that have been producing – we’re really sticking on those guys to make sure they’re not playing as well,” Evans said.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match against UCSD is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-falls-to-defending-national-champs-for-second-straight-loss/","id":5326,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5325,5324,5323],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
