Several students approached the podium during the public forum and argued that the council ignored the student body’s interests.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one speaker placed responsibility for the council’s decision on Internal Vice President Chloe Stryker due to her tie-breaking vote. Although Stryker said she supports the SOCC, she does not believe A.S.’s special projects budget should finance the conference.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she offered to dedicate $600 from her office’s funds toward the conference but did not receive a request from the group until Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter said the council’s debate focused on the appropriateness of using the special projects budget rather than the SOCC’s goals.</p>\n<p>Walter asked student attendees for input to help prove the council’s support after hearing numerous speakers.</p>\n<p>“Would you like it if we make a public statement of support, perhaps published in the Nexus — hopefully, if the Nexus will run it — would that make be a sufficient show of support?” Walter said.</p>\n<p>However, SOCC speakers said a public statement would only serve as an appeasement.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Sophia Armen, who chose to address the council as a student body member, said the student government’s endorsement for such events is vital for the campus community.</p>\n<p>“Support folks that do good shit! Students of color are disproportionately marginalized [and] they have to go through so much every day,” Armen said. “Being in this room, sitting at this table is a privilege. You are no longer acting for yourself; you are acting in consideration of other people … The climate of this room is not progressing us towards making this a more inclusive association.”</p>\n<p>In light of the council’s $145 Oct. 27 allocation toward the Campus Democrats, A.S. President Harrison Weber said the issue provokes a larger discussion on the council budget’s intended use.</p>\n<p>“The council needs to define what [its] special projects [budget] is for,” Weber said. “It sends a mixed message that the role of special projects isn’t to fund groups, but another group was funded. Also, I think it speaks to the larger issue: we need to have more discussion outside of this council.”</p>\n<p>The council had yet to discuss the bills and resolutions on last night’s agenda including legislation to restructure the External Vice President of Local Affairs, IVP and CAB Foundation offices as of press time.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

living on campus, as required by Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code for her position as an on-campus senator.</p>\n<p>“[By] not living On-Campus Yasamin Salari is unable to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” she said in the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yasamin-Salari-Petition-Redacted.pdf\">petition</a>, which was filed on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Mukai could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Mukai references Article III, Section 1 Eligibility, Subsection B4 of Legal Code, which states that “Senate Representatives must live among their constituents during Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters of their year of elective service.”</p>\n<p>Senate granted Salari a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">one-time exception</a> at its Nov. 14 meeting during Fall Quarter 2018 after she spoke about her housing situation. During that meeting, she explained that she had originally planned to live on campus, but was unable to do so due to financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email to the <i>Nexus </i>that she was “still waiting on more information about this whole situation” and would be able to discuss it further after midterms were over.</p>\n<p>According to a notice posted in A.S. Main by Judicial Council Chair Raymond Alonso, the council will be holding a hearing for the case on Feb. 20 at 6:30 p.m. in the Lobero Room in the University Center.</p>\n<p>At the Wednesday night Senate meeting, College of Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno introduced a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\">bill</a> to create Standing Policy 36, which would address the issue of senators not living amongst their constituents, Salari in particular.</p>\n<p>The Senate tabled the bill for a week.</p>\n<p>The policy establishes rules for senators who change living arrangements or colleges while serving in their positions. Previously, senators with living arrangement issues were given one-time exceptions without an ensuing Legal Code change, the bill explains.</p>\n<p>The bill writes that senators who are no longer able to live among their constituents for external circumstances — which “may include but is not limited to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” — will be given the opportunity to explain the situation before the Senate votes on whether to grant them a one-time exception.</p>\n<p>If they are not granted a one-time exception, they will be removed from the Senate.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simren Verma contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated 10:46 p.m.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

There could be some hesitation. That hesitation could be coming from different places, but to see these types of events is an opportunity to learn more about immigrant experiences,” Diana Ordorica, UCSB’s USS coordinator, said.</p>\n<p>The allyship-based event encouraged attendees to put up posters supporting undocumented students in their workspaces, rooms or social media pages.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve had presentations to update folks about what’s going on with immigration. We’ve had trainings for staff, faculty and graduate students,” Ordorica said. This training-oriented experience pursued in the past was once again employed during this year’s Immigration Awareness Week through the second major event of the annual occasion.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 24, a workshop in the Student Resource Building, titled “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Training,” promoted a holistic approach to supporting queer and transgender undocumented students. It was open to graduate students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>While partially informational, the workshop also contributed to the visibility of LGBTQIA+ immigrant students through the sharing of stories and experiences from individuals well-acquainted with the struggles of the queer immigration experience.</p>\n<p>“With the current administration that we have, immigration is right at the forefront of everything,” Dwayne Mosbey, RCSGD program coordinator, said. “It’s very important for someone who is working with the LGBTQ community to be working with all of these intersecting communities and these intersecting identities that students may have.”</p>\n<p>With this sentiment in mind, the “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans” training session featured guest speakers who gave attendees descriptions of firsthand experiences from undocumented, LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>\n<p>“As progressive as a school UCSB is, I think folks have a lot of presumptions about communities that they’re unfamiliar with, so this is an opportunity for those who are allies to make themselves more well-known for those who aren’t as educated or as well-knowledged about the subject to finally get that kind of information,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>According to Mosbey, events like “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Training” are meant “to create visibility for students and members of the community who are a part of the undocumented community — for them to feel like folks care about them and that they have clear support here on campus.”</p>\n<p>To conclude Immigration Awareness Week, an open house for UCSB’s Immigration Legal Services was held on Jan. 25 to further highlight the resources available to undocumented immigrant students. The open house, held in the Annex, offered advice from Managing Attorney Vivek Mittal, Attorney Ron Perry and other advisors who make up the Immigration Legal team at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This week is shining the spotlight for a moment, but it’s — more than anything — igniting a movement to continue on through this year,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>“I want folks who are allies or folks who are not as knowledgeable about the subject to come to Immigration Awareness Week, take the information in, analyze within themselves what kind of internalized presumptions they may have, challenge those presumptions and then continue to uplift these communities that have be ingrained in America since its conception.”</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:56 a.m.]</i></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</i></p>\n<p><i>Nyah Scott is a reporter at the Daily Nexus</i><em> and can be reached at news@daliynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
