legislature in June. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/BudgetSummary/HigherEducation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allocates $36 billion for higher education across the state, offers a 5% increase in “base” resources for UC campuses, as well as funding for several specific programs on UC campuses, including the expansion of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, UC San Francisco School of Medicine and the UC San Diego Center for Public Preparedness Multi-Campus Research Initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important step toward covering the funds necessary to meet UC’s tripartite mission of delivering world-class education, conducting cutting-edge research and providing public service that benefits California and beyond,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez and UC President Janet Napolitano said in a joint statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to ongoing funding, the budget aims to help students who require immigration legal services to defend themselves in court, support degree and certificate completion programs at UC extension centers and develop a UC Subject Matter Project in computer science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement by UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar, who “welcomed” the proposed budget, she expressed hope that UCSA could work with legislators “to secure additional investments that reflect UC student priorities: investments in outreach and retention programs, mental health services, and resources for undocumented students, foster youth, and formerly incarcerated students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the budget proposal stated that “these investments are provided with the expectation that UC will continue to focus on maintaining college affordability, increasing student access, improving timely degree completion, and reducing achievement gaps,” it made no explicit mention of the services Sarveshwar detailed in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget also detailed expectations for the UC System, but it held no requirements to maintain current tuition rates. The UC has proposed a tuition increase over five years to fund financial aid and other campus needs, with the UC Regents voting on the increase Jan. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarveshwar stated that “UCSA also hopes to work with the Governor’s office and members of the legislature to secure the funding necessary to avoid a tuition increase.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s proposed budget took into account the “significant growth” of the UCs in the past few years, and this year’s budget increase seems intended to do the same, as the proposal states that its 10 campuses now enroll more than 280,000 students, as opposed to far smaller numbers merely a decade ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsom’s budget will not go into effect until it is voted on by the state legislature in June. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

The UConsent campaign is a UC-wide initiative proposed by UCSA in 2014 to support student survivors of sexual assault through education and advocacy.</p>\n<p>According to UCSA Undergraduate Chair and third-year sociology and education double-major and External Vice President (EVP) at UC Davis Sam Alavi, the board worked hard to solidify the rubric which will be used to evaluate on-campus mental health services. Alavi said the rubric will include total wait time to see a counselor, the total number of Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) counselors available and whether or not the C.A.P.S. building is accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“We figure out what is right and wrong with the mental health services, we give them a grade and then we give them solutions to have them improve their services and help raise their grade,” Alavi said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Mohsin Mirza said the meeting began with a discussion about what other campuses have done in conjunction with their C.A.P.S. centers.</p>\n<p>“We are beginning to quantify the data that we’ve gathered so that we can better advocate for the solutions that our students need,” said Mirza.</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, the UConsent campaign advocates for a diverse set of counselors who can relate and provide help to various students seeking help.</p>\n<p>“We want to make sure that these conversations are as intersectional as they can be and so the statistics are not whitewashed,” Alavi said. “Part of this is talking about how certain communities face more sexual assault than others and training staff members to work with students who are undocumented or transgender so that they can support their identities.”</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, students felt UCSA did not prioritize sexual assault enough, which motivated the board to create a plan for preventative education about sexual assault on college campuses. Alavi also said the board is pushing for UC Office of the President (UCOP) to host a peer-to-peer training symposium where students across the UC system come together to look at the best practices for consent training.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we’ve done is pressure the regents and president Napolitano to mandate sexual assault prevention education,” Alavi said. “We believe that if we can start having these conversations, we can prevent a lot of the sexual assaults that happen, instead of focusing on dealing with their aftermath.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is hopeful of the accomplishments to come as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>“The level of dedication and planning that we have done these past board meetings makes me optimistic that we are going to make our students very proud,” Mirza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65332\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65332\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-discusses-mental-health-sexual-assault-policy/","id":3616,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[3615,3614,3613],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSA  Reviews UCOP 2015-16 Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) presented its 2015-16 budget at the monthly University of California Student Association (UCSA) meeting Saturday at UC Riverside. UCOP Inter...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) presented its 2015-16 budget at the monthly University of California Student Association (UCSA) meeting Saturday at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>UCOP Interim Executive Director for Budget and Director of State Government Relations at UC Berkeley Kieran John Flaherty presented the UCOP’s proposed 2015-16 budget and displayed connections between the California State budget and the UC budget. UCSA also reviewed the May Revise of the UCOP Budget Act of 2015, which froze tuition at current levels for a total of six years but allowed for mandatory tuition increases pegged to inflation after the six-year period.</p>\n<p>According to State Department of Finance data Flaherty presented, the primary source of state revenue is Personal Income Tax (P.I.T.), the secondary source is Sales and Use Tax (SUT) and additional revenue is from corporate tax. Flaherty said the P.I.T. has increased more than the SUT in recent years because California’s economy is largely based in universities and educational institutions rather than taxable services.</p>\n<p>“Nowadays … we don’t have a sales tax on services and our economy in California is very much a knowledge-based economy,” Flaherty said. “Good for us, because we are all in school.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the State now decides its budget in June, as opposed to January in previous years. Flaherty said this change benefits the state but poses a challenge to the UCs, as the universities must plan the yearly budget without knowing the State’s contribution.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge improvement now that the budget is settled in June because the fiscal year starts in July,” Flaherty said. “[It’s] still problematic for the University because in November we are set to approve our budget for the University, we accept students in the spring and we are not really sure how much funding we are going to receive from the State until after that.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the relationship between the State and the UC is characterized by “volatility.”</p>\n<p>“It’s has been that way pretty much forever,” Flaherty said. “Agreements between UC and the administration in the past, called compacts or partnerships … are things that can’t bring stability and predictability to the UC state budget.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, UC partnerships with the Governor are generally multi-year and extend beyond the one-year budgeting cycle that the Legislature appropriates for.</p>\n<p>“So a lot of state agencies — so labor unions for instance — a lot of businesses who have advocated for and received a tax benefit, for instance — they like to plan those over a multi-year basis,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty said the State Legislature may oppose multi-year partnerships between the governor and the UC because their decision-making role is bypassed.</p>\n<p>“The Legislature is far less fond of these funding frameworks than administrations and the University,” Flaherty said. “The Legislature is basically left out of the process, yet they are asked to approve the funding for it without having had that much input.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the UC budget fell from 103 billion dollars to 87 billion within one fiscal year after the 2008 recession.</p>\n<p>“Less revenue resulted in cuts for almost all of the agencies … and all departments, and of course UC, CSU, the community colleges [and] K-12 were not exempt from those cuts by any stretch of the imagination,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the State proposed a 25 million dollar addition to the current UC budget year if the university projects enrollment of 5,000 more undergraduate students by next May.</p>\n<p>“The State is attempting to incentivize the University to really grow enrollment by a lot more than we anticipated,” Flaherty said. “Initially back in November … last year we were thinking of growing about 2,200 students, a lot of budgetary uncertainty at that time … so there was basically no growth of undergraduate students or marginal growth of undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty said he does not like the term “affordability” when discussing tuition because it is not the only factor in student expenses.</p>\n<p>“From a student’s perspective, affordability is a total cost of attendance,” Flaherty said. “It involves housing … it involves the reality of how much support some students provide to their families. It is not just tuition alone.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

committee selecting the next head of the University of California.</span> <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event, preceded by a town hall hosted on the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/the-uc-should-strive-for-better-students-faculty-and-stakeholders-share-suggestions-for-the-next-uc-president-at-ucla-public-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> two days earlier, helps distinguish this search for a new president as being the first in which the Regents Committee have created space for public input.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the UCR speakers raised similar issues as those at UCLA, including advocacy for undocumented students and the need for climate change action, many statements addressed challenges facing the campus specifically. In particular, town hall attendees discussed difficulty the campus has had in meeting its goals of increasing student enrollment while also continuing to provide a quality and affordable education to its current student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These inequities were recognized by many individuals present, including Robin Russin, a professor in the Department of Theatre, Film, and Digital Production at UCR. Russin expressed his frustration with the lack of funding given to the university to meet this challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need money; we need resources. We cannot grow without them,” Rossin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are already in a highly impacted situation … this idea of growing to 35,000 students [by 2035] is simply not real. It can’t happen. We’re already overstressed unless we’re given the resources for new faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Chase-Dunn, a sociology professor at UCR, expressed bewilderment at the campus goal of expanding resources to accommodate 10,000 extra students within the next 15 years. He emphasized the ongoing challenges in addressing the already-expanding undergraduate student body with a limited amount of resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chase-Dunn, many faculty members remain “very concerned” about this issue since there does not seem to be a plan for sustainable growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we just expand and take care of all of the poor kids in California and solve the problem for the rest ofrestall the other campuses, we’re gonna be diplomable, doing online courses and handing out things, but it won’t really be an institution that meets the stands of the University of California system,” he stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The plan is to expand the campus hugely over the next few years, and we’re very concerned because apparently there’s no agreement on how we’re going to have enough resources in order to do that,” Chase-Dunn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the students and faculty at UCR also condemned the current lack of resources and the fact that classes are held in old buildings with various utility issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Architect Jaqueline Norman, many of the buildings on campus were built during the early 1900s and during the 1950s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of these buildings have not had any significant renovation or improvements since their original construction,” Norman said. “Supporting contemporary learning and cutting-edge research in aging buildings with often failing infrastructure is a daily institutional challenge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many also expressed their frustrations regarding a perceived status bias and disparity in funding allocations — </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2012/06/10/rebenching_budget_model_to_evenly_allocate_state_funds_per_student_to_each_uc_campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2012 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, showed an allocation of $398 million at UCLA, versus $154 million given to UCR and $117 million to UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are the lowest core-funded campus in the UC, heavily reliant on state funds, tuition and fees,” Jennifer Brown, a professor of public policy, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we need is a president … who will reverse the structural inequities which have existed across the system. As a woefully underfunded campus, UCR has fewer resources for our current students than other UC campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to figures obtained from UCR Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox’s office, which showed that UCLA receives $11,444 per student, while UCR receives $8,447 per student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand that there are weighted algorithms involved in this, but we still believe that this is an instance of institutional racism,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed this to the composition of UCR’s </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student body</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has a higher proportion of minority students compared to other campuses in the UC system on average. The student body, of which 86.6% identifies as a minority, has a higher overall ethnic diversity than </span><a href=\"http://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. More Pell Grant students are enrolled at UCR than at all of the Ivy League universities combined, and nearly 60% of the student body is made up of first-generation college attendees, according to data from the official </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Therefore, we ask that the next president commit to funding UCR on a proportional basis equivalent to other campuses and erase the structural inequalities which are deeply eroding the quality of access at UCR,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also associated lack of funding as being especially harmful to minority or underrepresented groups, often drawing from their own personal experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silvia Ferrer, a DACA recipient at the university, spoke about navigating the legal difficulties associated with her immigration status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferrera cited university support groups as critical in supporting her academic endeavors, but also described these programs as being “substantially underfunded,” which she said came as no surprise in light of the campus’s status as the lowest core-funded campus in the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent Rasso, director of government relations for Associated Students at UCR, said that the next UC president must work to help students facing urgent housing and food insecurities, issues which he attributed to being more pervasive at UCR among Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next UC president must be a strong ally to students by working diligently within university and legislative governance to uplift the voices of  students,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public commentary for the next UC president can be submitted to the Regents through email or postal mail, with the addresses on the Search Committee </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/public-input.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/heather-carr/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Heather Carr</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Heather Carr is an Opinion and News staff writer.
