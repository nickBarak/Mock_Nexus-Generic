Each of 38 dance teams represented one patient from Cottage Hospital and entered after meeting the minimum entry requirements. To celebrate the funds they raised, participants engaged in a 12-hour-long dance party from noon until midnight, partaking in activities, entertainment and free food from local businesses such as Panda Express, Sorriso Italiano and Silvergreens.</p>\n<p>Event co-chair and alumnus Sean Thompson said Dance Marathon will continue to host the event in an effort to increase their fundraising goals. This year’s raised amount surpassed last year’s total of $12,791.84.</p>\n<p>“We up the ante every year,” Thompson said. “This year our goal was to double the fundraising, double the amount of people and next year, who knows?”</p>\n<p>According to co-chair of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biological science major Molly Morrison, about 400 participants raised money, an increase from last year’s 200 participants. Morrison said this is indicative of an upward trend in participation she hopes to continue.</p>\n<p>“This is the second annual event and we’re hoping to continue for generations and generations,” Morrison said. “Children’s Miracle Network nationally reached out to the UCSB campus as they were looking to extend their reach on the west coast. They came to UCSB and we’re here now.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said Dance Marathon began in 1991 at Indiana University in honor of Ryan White, a student who was expelled from his middle school in 1984 after being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The event was then adopted by Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. According to Morrison, dance marathons are now held on over 250 campuses nationwide with participants staying and dancing for a full 12 hours without sitting down to show support for hospitalized children.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are standing for the kids that can’t,” Morrison said. “The people who really want to stay for the kids stay the whole time.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61465\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61465\" data-attachment-id=\"61465\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon-members-engaged-in-a-zumba-session/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425082645\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61465\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session.

We can get together and feel like we can help donate and have a good time together at the same time.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_61473\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"216681619\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61473\" data-attachment-id=\"61473\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon_alex-gonzalez-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425172318\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-61473\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11.  <em>Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

beets.<em> Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) hosted their quarterly Green Chef sustainable cooking competition Sunday afternoon in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>This quarter, beets were the sustainable ingredient required for all competitors’ dishes. The dishes were separated into appetizers, entrées and desserts, and attendees were invited to sample and vote for their favorites, while the winners of each category received a gift card to the Isla Vista Food Co-op.</p>\n<p>EAB Green Chef Coordinator Kristen Herrera said the required ingredient is always locally grown and organic.</p>\n<p>“We basically take local, organic, in-season foods and we distribute that to students so that they can then make their own dishes with whatever that ingredient is,” Herrera said. “The I.V. Food Co-op has given us the beets that are the highlight.”</p>\n<p>EAB Co-Chair Heather Vest said the event started several years ago, and said it encourages students to cook using sustainable, local foods by providing the ingredients for free.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pretty big event. Every quarter people come out and love to cook. … I think it teaches a lot about how to cook sustainably in I.V., which is really important,” Vest said. “It also just teaches people how to cook in general. Giving recipes out and stuff, it’s awesome.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61466\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61466\" data-attachment-id=\"61466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/cooking-competitors-beets-beat-others/green-chef_paris-cullen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425233918\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"27\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Green Chef Comp\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61466\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Chef_Paris-Cullen.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Is it beets? All dishes from participants in the competition had to include the dark purple root.<em> Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology and communication major Christina Laskorunsky, who attended the Green Chef competition, said she enjoyed the event’s atmosphere and food selection.</p>\n<p>“There’s a really nice community feeling [to the competition],” Laskorunsky said. “Everything is vegetarian or organic or local and I think that’s really good.”</p>\n<p>Laskorunsky also said the event makes a positive impact on the I.V. and Santa Barbara community because consuming produce from local farms helps promote local economic growth, health and sustainability.</p>\n<p>“Sustainability is important just because it makes our food healthier and helps the environment. It’s good for helping our local farmers instead of farmers from who-knows-where. It strengthens community bonds,” Laskorunsky said. “I like the idea of community coming together for a common purpose, and getting local food is a part of that.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Maxine Hamilton and fourth-year biology and environmental studies major Veronica Emrich both cooked one the event’s winning dishes — Thai beet stew with creamy peanut sauce. Hamilton said she largely enjoyed the Green Chef competition because it engaged students to actively think about the environmental impacts of food production.</p>\n<p>“I’m all about sustainable food and how food relates to our impact on the environment,” Hamilton said. “I think it’s an important topic to get people on campus thinking about, and it’s a really fun way to do it because everybody gets free food.”</p>\n<p>The Green Chef competition will take place again Spring quarter with a new special ingredient selected by EAB Green Chef Coordinator Herrera.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Residential Services and the Resident Housing Association (RHA) hosted the grand opening ceremony for the new Channel Island 5 (ChI-5) Outdoor Fitness Area located adjacent to the the Santa Cruz Residence Hall basketball courts on Friday.</p>\n<p>Students and staff came together for the ribbon-cutting of the outdoor exercise station that includes a leg press, dip bar, pull-up bar, pull-down machine and hip-flexing machine. After an approximately year-long collaborative effort between staff and students, the new station is now ready for use by resident students in the ChI-5 residence halls: Anacapa, San Miguel, San Nicholas, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and political science double major and 2013-2014 RHA President Andrew Soriano, Health &amp; Wellness Program Health Advocate Assistant Feras Maidaa brought the idea for the fitness area to him in summer 2013, after which Soriano suggested reaching out to Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) students to form focus groups to gauge student needs.</p>\n<p>“During the [FSSP] working group, they talked about having some sort of place to work out outside,” Soriano said. “I relayed that information to housing and they took it and rolled with it. They made it happen.”</p>\n<p>Maidaa said the fitness equipment was chosen after considering feedback from the FSSP focus groups.</p>\n<p>“We made the study group, and [the students] selected the pieces of equipment that they wanted to use over here,” Maidaa said. “So this project is our students’ project — they helped us to make it happen.”</p>\n<p>Housing &amp; Residential Services Environmental &amp; Energy Programs Manager Mark Rousseau said constructing the fitness area took longer than had been originally anticipated.</p>\n<p>“We thought this would be an easy project that we could do,” Rousseau said. “Well, everything is long and slow as you know how things go in a big university. This was a wild project.”</p>\n<p>According to Maidaa, the stainless steel equipment was ordered from Norwell Outdoor Fitness in Denmark and the fitness area’s spongy turf surface was selected because it provided the best cushioning for students to feel comfortable while working out.</p>\n<p>“We definitely did a lot of research to get the best equipment and best surfacing material for this station,” Maidaa said.</p>\n<p>Maidaa said he hopes there will be more outdoor fitness areas constructed on campus for students to use to work out.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping that this is stage number one,” Maidaa said. “We are thinking about doing another station across the campus.”</p>\n<p>Soriano said the new fitness area provides students living in the on-campus residence halls more convenient access to exercise equipment.</p>\n<p>“There’s finally a pull-up bar that’s not a bike ride away,” Soriano said. “I feel like for everyone who wants to work out outside, you’re no longer cooped to the mini-gyms in like Santa Rosa or San Miguel.”</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Kyle Hordyk said he believes the fitness area was “a big waste of money” that could have been better spent elsewhere, such as refurbishing the existing basketball and volleyball courts. He also said, however, that the fitness area is a close-proximity alternative to the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>“But for those who do plan to exercise, it makes it a lot more accessible than having to trek all the way to the Recreation Center,” Hordyk said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61492\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/fitness-area-opens-by-campus-dorms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61492\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/fitness-area-opens-by-campus-dorms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/fitness-area-opens-by-campus-dorms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/fitness-area-opens-by-campus-dorms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/fitness-area-opens-by-campus-dorms/","id":2858,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2857,2856,2855],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
