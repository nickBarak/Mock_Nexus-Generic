includes all kinds of romaine lettuce, such as romaine hearts, heads, boxes of pre-cut lettuce and salad mixes.</p>\n<p>Residents should also clean drawers or shelves where the lettuce was stored.</p>\n<p>There have not yet been any outbreaks — caused by the bacteria E. coli — in Santa Barbara County as of Tuesday.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s dining facilities are not serving any romaine lettuce, UCSB Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst confirmed in an email.</p>\n<p>Initial outbreaks began on Oct. 8, with <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm626716.htm\">43 sick so far across 12 states</a>. Of those, 11 have been in California.</p>\n<p>There have also been 22 reports of E. coli sickness in Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in a press release sent out Monday.</p>\n<p>Symptoms generally surface three to four days after consuming something that contains the bacteria, according to the FDA. The bacteria can manifest itself through diarrhea, high fevers and vomiting.</p>\n<p>The department confirmed during Thanksgiving break that the contaminated lettuce appeared to have come from the Central Coast growing regions from Central and Northern California, specifically from lettuce grown during this past summer.</p>\n<p>“The FDA believes it was critically important to have a ‘clean break’ in the romaine supply available to consumers in the U.S. in order to purge the market of potentially contaminated romaine lettuce related to the current outbreak,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>For the near future, romaine lettuce will be labeled with its harvest date and location, according to the FDA.</p>\n<p>The FDA is still investigating the outbreak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The board motioned to authorize the general manager to request funding from the university to cover the program.</p>\n<p>The finalization of the MOU encountered a minor hurdle during the meeting due to concerns about the contract phrasing which stipulated the investigator “be the primary point of contact for all such investigations occurring within the boundaries of the District.”</p>\n<p>A representative from the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) who was present during the meeting reported that the language in the MOU would create an interference with services and jurisdiction of the SBSO.</p>\n<p>“We just need to work through this to make sure we are not subverting the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff and that we are not supplanting the services that are already provided by the Sheriff as it relates to these investigations,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Brianna Conway countered their concerns, saying the inclusion of the term “primary point of contact” provided an essential element to the position of the investigator.</p>\n<p>“What that does is tell survivors that the first person they tell [their] story to is gonna be the person that stays with [their] case throughout the duration… and really provide that continuity in care in that response,” Conway said during the public comment period.</p>\n<p>Several I.V. CSD directors agreed with Conway’s suggestions, adding that these were consistent with the intended model of the program.</p>\n<p>However, UCPD would be in charge of implementation of such policy practices during the operalization of the investigator position, according to I.V. CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have pushed for the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator in I.V., including Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), C.A.R.E, UCPD and the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Members of SASA who were present at Tuesday’s meeting were glad to see the fulfillment of a program that was under discussion for over a year.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long conversation… We’re very happy to see that the needs to the community and the need for the localization of the resource being finally represented in the MOU,” SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>Bertrand also expressed similar sentiments of both hope and happiness at the long-awaited implementation of an interpersonal violence survivor service in Isla Vista</p>\n<p>“This will be successful. This is really about serving our community, making it a safer place and us, Isla Vista’s local government, saying that we believe survivors, that we stand with survivors and that time’s up,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Right before making the official motion to finalize the contract, Bertrand recounted the I.V. CSD’s first meeting, in which an attendee shared her experience of being a survivor of sexual assault in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The most important comment that I heard that night was… about the experiences of so many survivors in this community and it’s those experiences that really make me happy that we’re taking this action here,” Bertrand said, tearing up during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“There’s too many people getting hurt in this community. There’s no perfect way to solve it but this is a really good step and I’m just grateful that we’re taking it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
