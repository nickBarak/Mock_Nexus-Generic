Angie Banks/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, Boris Jovanovic’s water polo career has been remarkable — enough to etch his name into the Gaucho history books. The 6’1” senior driver has caught everyone’s attention since his arrival here at UCSB years ago, but his fourth and final collegiate season was the most impactful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although his tenure here has been a great success, his story of moving from Novi Sad, Serbia, and how water polo led him here is quite unique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My journey here to UCSB was actually very extraordinary,” Jovanovic stated. “None of my family had ever visited or lived in the United States. I didn’t really know how any of the programs worked, but in America I saw a great opportunity. The coaching staff here was incredible and far beyond any others at the collegiate level; that made the decision to come here easy.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the early part of his collegiate career and his initial experience with UCSB’s water polo program, Jovanovic’s response was, “It’s a change of mentality, a change in understanding with this team, a different approach altogether. Prior to this season I was not used to carrying such a work load, leading this team and fitting in as the captain. Growing into that position was a hard process, but I found great camaraderie with the team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, one can quickly notice the importance that Jovanovic’s stats had on the team’s overall performance. Through the 26 total games that he played, he closed the year with 78 goals, which impressively averages out to a hat trick a game, while also adding 10 assists to his name. His scoring production not only led his team but also had him tied for the most in the entire Golden Coast Conference.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very satisfied with what I’ve done; I think I helped the team out and believe I always did my best both in practice and in games. My teammates also helped me reach my individual goals and reached a level of success I hadn’t expected nor planned for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovanovic’s great stat line also translated to the team’s shared success. With a final Gaucho overall record of 18-8, this year’s record was tied for the program’s all-time best, with the last 18-8 mark occurring back in 1991. Thanks to such a great campaign, the NCAA also ranks UCSB within the top five men’s water polo programs in the nation.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As far as the team goes, I’m very proud of what we had accomplished. This year the team was very well-structured; it was a group of people who all had the same goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the bright future in store for the returning Gauchos, Jovanovic said, “We have a great group of people who are returning, and changing one element [i.e. his departure] definitely won’t change the whole machinery that was created.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add to their team’s success, four Gauchos were recognized with All-GCC honors: Jovanovic, sophomore goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano, junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and sophomore attacker Leo Yuno.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Further recognizing his teammates’ play, Jovanovic added, “To name only a few other people who didn’t get the nod, probably because they had to include more people from other teams: Jacob Halle, Tommy Fellner, Cole Brosnan and Adam Lott. They and many others are all coming back, and I believe UCSB will have its strongest year next year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jovanovic’s accolades don’t end there, however, as his 78 goals this year was the seventh most ever scored in a single season at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, his career total of 178 goals earns him the fifth place spot among career scoring leaders. “It’s something that I’m truly proud of and happy about because it’s what will remain of the four years I’ve spent here; it brings me a lot of joy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides his obvious scoring prowess, Jovanovic was also asked about what he believes is the next best part of his game, to which he replied, “It’s usually hard to talk about the best parts of your game and easy to talk about what I could improve, but if I had to choose one thing, I hope I provided leadership and the will the fight until the end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about his most memorable moment, he said, “The most memorable moment of the season was the team huddle, every time before jumping in — the cheers that we did, as well as being able to stand there in front of the guys and say a couple of words to motivate them, hopefully.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This altogether concludes Jovanovic’s stellar performance for the Gauchos, but if you ask him about what else is in store for him, he’ll respond with the utmost satisfaction and confidence.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any more water polo aspirations; I have been playing this sport for some 15 years and I feel really satisfied with what I’ve been able achieve here at UCSB. I’m now working on personal goals for my career, but I think with water polo this was may be the last year, and I’m very proud that I could be in a Gaucho cap here with my team … I’ll be their biggest supporter and I look forward to hopefully watching the best games UCSB’s ever had.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, Jovanovic added, “It’s worth mentioning again that the team and coaches worked hard together … ultimately, the most important thing was that we achieved something together through hard work and it’s something we all fought for. It’s something that I want to thank all those people for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  <em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily

With a logjam in the middle of the standings, UCSB will need to string together a win streak if it hopes to improve its seeding for the conference tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the Gauchos will host Cal State Northridge (CSUN) and UC Riverside (UCR) in two crucial matchups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, the ‘Chos will take on the Matadors on Thursday in a rematch of last Saturday’s game — a 65-55 road victory for Santa Barbara. That game was in large part dominated by freshman phenom Ila Lane, who finished the game with 16 points and 17 rebounds. On defense, Lane played a key role in shutting down CSUN’s leading scorer — senior De’Jionae Calloway, who finished the game with only 4 points on 2-12 shooting from the floor.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Tal Sahar also turned in one of her best performances of the season, chipping in 18 points off the bench for UCSB. In the fourth quarter in particular, Sahar left her stamp on the game, drilling three 3-pointers and shooting 75% from behind the arc in the quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Matadors were able to keep the game tight for much of the night. In particular, sophomore  guard Jordyn Jackson had an excellent night, finishing the game with 16 points on 6-9 shooting. In addition, despite a rough shooting night for CSUN’s starters, the team’s bench excelled all night, scoring 20 of the team’s 55 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB will have the home-court advantage this time around, don’t expect Calloway to shoot 17% from the floor this time around. The Matadors will also likely double and triple-team Lane in the post this go-around, meaning the Gauchos will need a significant contribution from their backcourt on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While senior Coco Miller didn’t shoot the ball particularly well on Saturday — finishing the game with 8 points on 3-13 shooting — her contributions extend far beyond her field-goal percentage. Currently, Miller ranks fourth in the country with a 3.1 assist-to-turnover ratio. Against the Matadors, Miller finished the game with 8 assists and only 2 turnovers and will need to continue that level of production and efficiency if the Gauchos are to walk away victorious on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, UCSB will take on UC Riverside (8-16, 4-6), looking to avenge their loss from earlier this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that game — a 66-61 victory for the Highlanders — Lane struggled mightily with foul trouble, only logging 26 minutes on the night. Without the focal point of their offense, the Gauchos struggled from the floor, shooting only 36% on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time around, UCSB will need to make a concerted effort to slow down UCR’s backcourt. In the previous matchup, junior guard Keilanei Cooper roasted the ‘Chos all night, finishing with 23 points on an efficient 8-13 shooting split.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, Santa Barbara needs to limit the production of redshirt senior Jannon Otto — who ranks second in the conference with 16.6 points per game. One of the best players in the entire conference, Otto can score from anywhere on the floor, shooting 36% from deep and 88% from the free-throw line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos can stay out of foul trouble and limit the production of UCR’s backcourt, they should have a good chance to finish the week with a crucial victory. Riverside has struggled mightily away from home this season, with only one of the team’s conference wins coming on the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will take on Cal State Northridge on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome, before finishing the week against UC Riverside on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

in their season this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two games on the docket, the first on Thursday at Cal State Fullerton and the second being a home rematch on Saturday against UC Davis, the Gauchos had the opportunity to bounce back and improve their positioning in the conference standings. UCSB took that opportunity and swept the week with a 75-66 win over the Titans and a 70-56 victory over the Aggies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two wins pushed the Gauchos’ record to 18-9 this season and 7-5 in conference play.

UCSB opened the game on an 11-0 run in the first three minutes, with graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman contributing 7 of the points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Matt Freeman had a monster first four minutes of the game,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “That really got us going.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloodied as they were by the Gauchos’ opening volley, the Titans showed no sign of quitting on their home court. Slowly and surely, Fullerton dragged their way into contention, at one point narrowing the UCSB lead to 2 points and went into the locker room down by 34-29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos maintained their advantage for the much of the second half but were unable to reopen their lead into the double-digits. Fullerton kept on hanging around, waiting for the opportunity to make their move.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That opportunity finally presented itself just after the eight-minute mark of the second half. The Titans stitched together the right combination of buckets and stops and took a 56-55 lead, their first of the game, with 7:34 to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baskets from each of Fullerton’s top three players — senior forward Jackson Rowe, graduate transfer guard Brandon Kamga and senior guard Austen Awosika — pushed the Titan lead to 63-59 with 5:40 left and forced UCSB onto its back foot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos responded to the reversal of fortunes with vigor. UCSB closed out the game on a 16-3 run for the 75-66 victory, giving the game a symmetrical appearance with Gaucho runs to open and close the proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Max Heidegger scored 8 of UCSB’s final 16 points and finished with a game-high 27 points. Heidegger also pulled down 7 rebounds and passed out 5 assists, making for a well-rounded performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger’s 7 boards tied him with junior guard Devearl Ramsey for a team-high rebound count. Neither Heidegger, at 6’3”, or Ramsey, at 6’ even, have anything resembling a height advantage on the glass, but both guards found a way to find the ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s matchup was the first between UCSB and Fullerton this season, giving the Gauchos their first chance to take on the team that knocked them out of the Big West Tournament last season. While the Titans are a much different team this season than they were last year, the element of revenge likely made the win just a little sweeter for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revenge was also at play on Saturday night against UC Davis. The Aggies came into the Thunderdome on a four-game winning streak, including an 84-75 win over UCSB last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out of the gate looking like a team intent on vengeance — perhaps a little too intent. UCSB committed 6 turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game, enabling UCD to jump out to an early 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like we were just a little anxious,” Ramsey said. “We just wanted to get out there and play really hard and we just had to channel our energy in the right way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a few minutes, but the Gauchos eventually managed to settle down and stop giving the ball away. Once that happened, UCSB was able to chip away, slowly but surely, at the Davis lead with good defense and some solid interior play by sophomore forward Amadou Sow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tip-in by junior guard Brandon Cyrus and a jumper by Heidegger brought the Gauchos within 2 points of the Aggies and forced UCD Head Coach Jim Les to call a timeout with 7:15 left in the half. That timeout did nothing to stop the Davis slide, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies turned the ball over immediately out of the timeout and suddenly, Ramsey  was everywhere. The point guard knocked down a 3, made a layup and knocked down another 3, all in the span of about 70 seconds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My teammates were just finding me, and in transition, I’m always going to try to push the pace,” Ramsey said. “Amadou had me on the skip [pass] and Max had me on the skip [pass]; those guys got me and I just hit my shots.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramsey’s one-man run pushed UCSB into the lead with 5:28 to go in the first half and energized the Thunderdome crowd. Freeman knocked down 2 free throws a few minutes later to make the score 31-21, but a couple of scores by Aggie senior guard Joe Mooney cut the deficit to 31-26 going into the locker room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither the Gauchos nor the Aggies were able to break away from the other for most of the second half. UCSB held onto their lead, but UCD managed to answer seemingly every basket or stop with one of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just under seven minutes left, the Gauchos managed to stitch together another run — their first real spurt of the half. After UC Davis freshman guard Ezra Manjon knocked down 2 free throws to cut the lead to 54-50, UCSB worked the ball inside: big man Sow scored twice and Heidegger flipped in a layup to push the lead to double digits for the first time in the half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Les immediately called a timeout and, unlike his earlier timeout, this one managed to flip the momentum, at least for a little bit. Junior forward Kennedy Koehler scored 3 straight times  to bring his team back within 4 points of the lead, putting some serious pressure on the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB responded with overwhelming force. Heidegger struck back first with a deep 3 from straightaway, and it was all Gauchos from there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koehler’s last layup in his personal mini-run was UC Davis’ last point of the night, and it came with 4:18 left on the clock. The Aggies were wholly unable to get a bucket from that point on, while UCSB poured on 10 straight points to close out the 14-point win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the end of regulation wasn’t particularly exciting, with the Gauchos holding such a commanding lead, the postgame handshake line had plenty of drama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Les appeared to pass Pasternack without a handshake and then yelled back at the Gaucho head coach. As Les was yelling, Mooney ran up behind Heidegger and shoved the Gaucho guard in the back, setting off a shoving match at center court that took a while to finally clear up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack didn’t provide an explanation of what exactly happened, but he did have plenty of praise for Les.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not sure [what was going on],” Pasternack said. “I think Coach Les is one of the best coaches in the country. I think he is very, very hard to beat. His teams execute as well as any team I’ve ever coached against in my career.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger led all scorers with 17 points, but Sow wasn’t far behind with 16 of his own. The second-year big had 6 rebounds and 2 blocks and made his presence felt against an undersized UC Davis team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, it was a guard cleaning up the boards for UCSB, but this time it was Cyrus with a team-high 8 rebounds. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin, meanwhile, led the Gauchos with 7 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB is a Thursday matchup against UC Riverside, who is currently second-to-last in the Big West, and then a Saturday game at UC Irvine. The Anteaters sit comfortably atop the Big West at 11-2, but the Gauchos stole their crown the last time the two teams met with a 64-61 victory.</span></p><div

in the Big West at 5-5, the UC Santa Barbara men’s basketball team has two chances this week to move up the ladder. The team also has two chances at revenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday evening, the Gauchos travel to take on Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) on the road before quickly returning to the Thunderdome to host UC Davis (UCD) on Saturday. The Titans bounced UCSB from the Big West Tournament last season, and the Aggies handed the Gauchos their most recent loss last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton team this season is quite different from the one that ended UCSB’s season last year. Both of the Titans’ leading scorers from last season are gone and playing professional ball in Europe, leaving Jackson Rowe, Brandon Kamga and Austen Awosika behind to handle much of the offensive load.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowe was Fullerton’s third-leading scorer last season and has picked up where he left off from last year. The senior forward missed the first 13 games of the season with a knee injury but is averaging a team-leading 15.6 points on 42.4% three-point shooting since his return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kamga is just a tick behind Rowe at 15.2 points per game overall this season but is averaging a team-high 19 points per game in conference play. Kamga, a graduate transfer from High Point University, is new to the Fullerton program but seems to have acclimated quite well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kamga […] is probably second in our league to [Cal State Northridge’s (CSUN)] Lamine Diane,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “He does a great, great job of getting baskets.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senior guard Awosika brings up the rear of the scoring triumvirate with 13.5 points per game, but he chips in 4 rebounds and a team-best 4.0 assists per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans are 10-16 overall this season, but they’re just a half-game behind the Gauchos in the Big West at 5-6. Thursday’s game isn’t just a chance for UCSB to avenge last year’s loss — it’s an opportunity for Fullerton to move up the ladder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re the team that knocked us out in the conference tournament,” Pasternack said. “They’re always a very good team. The league is so well rounded. The parity is amazing. On any given night, anybody can beat anybody.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton has compiled a record that proves Pasternack’s point. The Titans have lost to the Big West’s two last-place teams, Cal Poly and UC Riverside and have beaten UC Davis and CSUN, both tied for second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but Fullerton also upset UCLA earlier this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to know exactly what to expect from the Titans, but recent history suggests a lot of offense is likely. In six of CSUF’s last seven games, at least one team has scored over 70 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos don’t have much time to recover from Thursday’s game before they take on UC Davis at home on Saturday night. The two teams just met last Thursday, when the Aggies won 84-75 in a game more lopsided than the score would indicate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB couldn’t buy a bucket in the first half, shooting just 36% to Davis’ 50% mark. The Aggies took full advantage of the Gauchos’ slow start and rocketed out to a 36-24 halftime lead that they never fully relinquished[[ok]].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Credit to Davis, they played a great game,” Pasternack said. “They were very well-prepared. All credit goes to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only senior guard Max Heidegger’storrid second half, which saw him score 27 of his 31 points and knock down seven 3’s, kept UCSB in contention. Heidegger’s explosion aside, it was a dispiriting result for a Gaucho team that had been riding a three-game win streak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, UCSB will get the chance to bounce back from last week’s loss and land a serious blow against one of the team’s main Big West rivals. Thursday’s game pushed UCD past the Gauchos and up to second place in the conference at 6-5 and 12-15 overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack has been working his charges hard in practice this week in order to right the ship, and Thursday and Saturday’s games will test the effectiveness of his efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our guys have worked extremely hard,” Pasternack said. “It’s ‘next game.’ That’s the mentality. We lost a game, didn’t play well. They played really well, and now it’s on us to really lock in here and get ready for Thursday night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regular season is rapidly approaching its close, and the number of opportunities to move up the bracket for the Big West tournament is dwindling. The Gauchos get two opportunities this week to make a move up the standings and avenge a pair of losses — opportunities the team likely can’t afford to waste.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/following-tough-loss-ucsb-looks-to-rebound-against-csuf-ucd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/following-tough-loss-ucsb-looks-to-rebound-against-csuf-ucd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/following-tough-loss-ucsb-looks-to-rebound-against-csuf-ucd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/following-tough-loss-ucsb-looks-to-rebound-against-csuf-ucd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/following-tough-loss-ucsb-looks-to-rebound-against-csuf-ucd/","id":3419,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[3418,3417,3416],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
