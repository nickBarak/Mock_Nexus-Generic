Adds Museum Studies Emphasis","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.</p>\n<p>The emphasis combines specialized courses with selective internships at the Art, Design &amp; Architecture (ADA) Museum to give students a more broad education on museum-related careers. The emphasis has three main components: lower and upper division courses and seminars specific to the Museum Studies emphasis, internship opportunities, which are provided by the ADA Museum and two courses taken outside of the department to provide an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of Museum Studies.</p>\n<p>Director of the Museum Studies emphasis and a lecturer in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, Carole Paul said the emphasis will focus on the multiple facets of museum studies, which include emphasizes on historical, theoretical, operational and ideological aspects of art and architecture. </p>\n<p>“Many students in Art History are asking, ‘What am I going to do with a degree in Art History?’ and this is kind of a practical answer,” Paul said. “Through the internships and by giving students a broader knowledge about museums, they can begin thinking about a career path.”</p>\n<p>Paul said while most museum studies programs in the country are graduate programs with narrow foci, the new emphasis has an advantage in that it allows students to begin museum work as undergraduates.</p>\n<p>“With museum work, the sooner you’re introduced to it, the better. I myself had internships as an undergraduate. I went to Barnard College in New York, and I had an internship at the Guggenheim Museum, and I had internships in graduate school,” Paul said. “It’s a great way to learn about these fields; you can use your knowledge of Art History and find out what kind of jobs there really are out there.”</p>\n<p>Intern supervisor of the ADA Museum program Mary McGuire said internship experience is beneficial for students seeking employment at museums.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job, and the other people at the museum, it’s their job too, to write letters if someone wants one,” McGuire said. “If they’ve been an intern and they’ve shown their dedication to the museum, they’ll get a good letter by the end of their internship.” </p>\n<p>Acting director of the ADA Museum and History of Art and Architecture professor E. Bruce Robertson said the internships provided by the new emphasis give students the chance to make personal connections with professors.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that’s a little hard at UCSB because it’s a big university is to have a really personalized education experience,” Robertson said. “So one of the incentives of being an intern at the Museum is that it offers an intensely personalized experience. You’re working very, very closely with knowledgeable professionals.”</p>\n<p>McGuire said he recently traveled to Los Angeles for a tour provided by Robertson, who used to work at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).</p>\n<p>“He gave us an amazing tour about a painter who he’s very well acquainted with, who he’s written about a lot, named Marsden Hartley, and his exhibition was up at LACMA,” McGuire said. “So we got this tour from Professor Robertson that was absolutely first-hand knowledge, both of the collection — where it came from, the setting in which it was installed in the museum — and the history of the painter.”</p>\n<p>Paul said she has been working with local museums, galleries and arts organizations such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and the Arts Fund to create internships for students.</p>\n<p>“The Museum on campus has a great internship program, but also my aim with this emphasis is to give students as many options as possible,” Paul said. “So we have options within the community here in Santa Barbara, such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and the Historical Museum, the Arts Fund, and students can even do it further afield in Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Paul also said there are many departments with courses that relate to the Museum Studies emphasis, as outlined in the Museum Studies prospectus.</p>\n<p>“History, as I said, Sociology, Geography, Chicana and Chicano Studies, Religious Studies even art works very well,” Paul said. “So I think that there are lots of other majors that compliment this really well.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last week, after authorities disclosed the discovery of potential remains, protests sparked across Mexico and many parts of the United States, with students joining in the movement through organized protest in front of a row of 43 photos that represent each of the missing students.</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said the protest consisted of all day activities aimed at engaging and educating students about the incident in Mexico. </p>\n<p>“Today was a collective; we’re standing in solidarity with other UC campuses, and the entire world,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year anthropology major Stephany Rubio, who was one of many organizers of the demonstration, the issue concerning the student deaths has been worsened by the Mexican government’s control of traditional media in the country. </p>\n<p>“In Mexico, the president owns Televisa, which is the main source of getting any news and they’re quieting the situation down as much as they can,” Rubio said. “For us, <em>ya nos cansamos</em> — we’re tired, we want the state to take action.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said social media in Mexico is not regulated and that on the social media site Twitter the tag #YaMeCanse, which is trending worldwide and means, “Enough, I’m tired,” in Spanish, is directed at the Mexican government.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Spanish and sociology double major Jaime Serrano said he felt the need to participate in the protest because he feels there is not enough attention to the issue on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m out here because I think more needed to be done, here especially,” Serrano said. “With such large Spanish-speaking community, I feel more needed to be done about the injustices that are happening in Mexico.”</p>\n<p>According to fifth-year Latin American and Iberian studies and Spanish double major Gabriela Mora, the demonstration was meant to get more students to ask questions, take interest and possibly speak out against injustices in Mexico.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people haven’t even heard about the event,” Mora said. “We had a really good reaction here. We kind of scared people, but we’re not trying to instill fear.”</p>\n<p>Rubio also said she wants to see attention toward the deaths reach beyond campus and occur in other areas in the country. </p>\n<p>“We’re trying to reach farther than just the UCSB community,” Rubio said. “We want to reach the United States. What goes on over there, directly affects us here. The U.S. even funds the Mexican government. We want to reach internationally.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/students-protest-mexican-governments-connection-to-missing-students/","id":2958,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2957,2956,2955],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Author Delivers Talk on Mending Capitalism","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Author, entrepreneur and journalist Peter Barnes gave a talk called “Fixing Capitalism’s Deepest Flaws” on Tuesday evening at Corwin Pavilion.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p></p><div id=\"attachment_58699\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58699\" data-attachment-id=\"58699\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/author-delivers-talk-on-mending-capitalism/peter-barnes-archibald/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Peter-Barnes-Archibald.gif?fit=240%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"240,350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Peter-Barnes-Archibald\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Peter-Barnes-Archibald.gif?fit=171%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Peter-Barnes-Archibald.gif?fit=240%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Peter-Barnes-Archibald.gif?resize=240%2C350\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of loe.org\" width=\"240\" height=\"350\" class=\"size-full wp-image-58699\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-58699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of loe.org</em></p></div>Author, entrepreneur and journalist Peter Barnes gave a talk called “Fixing Capitalism’s Deepest Flaws” on Tuesday evening at Corwin Pavilion.\n<p>Barnes has authored several books and started an organization called Mesa Refuge, which serves as a retreat for writers. The talk was sponsored by the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at UCSB, and was free to the public. Barnes has written various books on the economy, including <em>Who Owns the Sky, Capitalism 3.0</em> and <em>With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough.</em></p>\n<p>Barnes said he believes in fixing capitalism rather than destroying it and that solutions to reforming capitalism boil involve addressing capitalism’s two “tragic” flaws.  </p>\n<p>“The relentless destruction of nature and the equally relentless widening of inequality,” Barnes said. “These flaws are coded into the system. If we want to change them we have to change the system itself, and it’s not enough to fiddle at the edges.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnes, reforming capitalism is an urgent affair that must be addressed on a systematic level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really have any time left to fiddle at the edges,” Barnes said. “We have to get to the fundamental systematic roots of these flaws and fix them.”</p>\n<p>Barnes also said capitalism’s flaws can be addressed by arguing against the idea that “the commons,” or community owned resources, are inherently self-destructive. This idea was originally proposed by late UCSB human ecology professor Garrett Hardin, according to Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The commons is not the perpetrator of tragedy but rather the victim and capitalism’s tragic flaws are the actual perpetrators, and that the commons, or what I now prefer to call common wealth, is actually a key part of the solution to the flaws of capitalism,” Barnes said.  </p>\n<p>According to Barnes, in order to fix the “deepest flaws of capitalism,” individuals need to “reclaim the commons,” or common wealth, by organizing and managing the commons on the basis of common ownership, common trustee ship and common benefit. Barnes also said he encouraged audience members to prepare for “the next crisis” by sharing his ideas regarding the commonwealth in writing and online. </p>\n<p>“Start saying things like, ‘The air belongs to all of us,’ or ‘Our money belongs to all of us. Our monetary system belongs to all of us. And they are taking it from us and we have a right to take it back.’” Barnes said. “Start naming common wealth and claiming it. If we do that I do believe that after the next crisis, we can fix the tragic flaws of capitalism.”<br>\n <br>\nEvent organizer and philosophy professor Gregory Jarrett said Barnes’ talk relates to one of his classes on environmental ethics. </p>\n<p>“This is relevant to my class on environmental ethics, but also as you will hear it is part of our mission to bring in other classes,” Jarrett said.  “They are also very excited, they are also talking about the same kind of things in different compartments, and this is our opportunity to get things together.”</p>\n<p>Students in Jarrett’s Environmental Ethics class, professor Robert Wilkinson’s Sustainable Communities, professor Philip McCarty’s Global Economic Development and his Global Studies 1 class were attendance at the lecture.    </p>\n<p>Jarrett said the event aims to bring together students with different majors to listen and talk with Barnes. </p>\n<p>“The goal is to get the students from different disciplines together in the same room not only hear him talk,” Jarrett said.  “But there will be a 30 minute Q and A so they get an opportunity to interact with a speaker like this.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year religious studies and physical geography double major Harlowe Wang said she enjoyed listening to Barnes’ ideas, but also does not see how they could be applied to the real world.</p>\n<p> “I think he was extending human stakeholders that are alive now too far to future generations and to non-human stakeholders,” Wang said.  “I thought his idea was amazing and I think it was very interesting and thought provoking [but] I wished he had spoken more to the actual feasibility and politics of it, because what I’ve taken away from is that its a really great idea … but I still don’t see how it would been implemented.”</p>\n<p>Following the lecture and question and answer segment, there was a book signing of Barnes’ With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough, which was available for purchase at the talk. </p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I need to be able to bring to the legislature and to the governor an overwhelming force from students, from UC and CSU unions, and make them realize how angry you are and how you are demanding a specific course of action, which is $100 million a year for the UC and $100 million a year for the CSU.”</p>\n<p>According to Daraka Larimore-Hall, secretary of the California Democratic Party, who has lobbied for years in Sacramento for higher education funding and opposed all UC tuition increases, all members of the UC system must communicate to the Regents that students cannot be treated as “customers.”</p>\n<p>“Now more than ever we have to provide that noise,” Larimore-Hall said. “Students, faculty members, staff, everyone in the University community, has to make their voice loud and clear to Sacramento, that not this time! This time, you don’t get to treat students as customers and cash cows. This time we need to tell the Regents no, absolutely not!”</p>\n<p>According to Robert Samuels, lecturer at UCLA and president of the University Council-American Federation of Teachers, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty in the UC system, tuition could actually increase up to nine percent per year, depending on how much funding the UC system receives from the state.</p>\n<p>“If you actually look at the plan that the office of the president presented, it says that there will be a maximum of 5 percent increases if the state gives 4 percent,” Samuels said. “Well, the governor, in his last budget, it clearly says if UC raises tuition, they lose four percent. So, it is possible that tuition will go up nine percent every year for five years. The plan that was presented is not predictable; it’s not sustainable.”</p>\n<p>However, according to the UC Office of the President, the tuition increase plan actually stipulates a maximum possible increase of five percent annually for five years, depending on the level of state contributions to UC.</p>\n<p>“The new long-term stability plan for tuition and financial aid would guarantee that tuition would not increase by more than 5 percent annually for five years, provided the state maintains its current investment commitment,” the UCOP Long-Term Funding Plan press release states. “The state could also choose to provide additional funds to cover tuition revenue, allowing UC to reduce or lower the tuition and fee increases proposed in this plan.”</p>\n<p>But Samuels said many students are not paying tuition due to Pell Grants, Cal Grants and institutional aid, and thus it is within reason for tuition to be free, as long as the rest of the funding the school receives is used appropriately.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure that the money that comes from the state, and the money that comes from your tuition, actually ends up in the classroom,” Samuels said. “What we’ve seen in the last 10 years is tuition keeps on going up and classes get bigger. There’s fewer graduate student instructors, there’s less personal attention for the students, there’s more multiple choice exams. The quality of education has gone down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58706\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58706\" data-attachment-id=\"58706\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7438/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=1600%2C1017&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1017\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416451771\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7438\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=250%2C159&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438.jpg?fit=888%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58706\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7438-1024x650.jpg?resize=500%2C312\" alt=\"Protesters chant outside of Cheadle Hall after a rally against UC tuition increase that took place Thursday in Storke Plaza.

External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh said students can do more than just rally to protest the tuition increase and that lobbying directly to legislators can be an effective form of action.</p>\n<p>“Student activism not only entails protesting as most people think, but also getting spot at the table with decision-making,” Singh said in an email. “Students need to work together on efforts, like lobbying legislators, because they need to see us people they were elected to serve. This happens with human interaction. Fortunately, Associated Students has a Lobby Corps, and I’m sure with my office collaborating, we will all be busy this year.”</p>\n<p>Singh, who attended the UC Regents meeting on Wednesday, said he learned that working with professors can increase the chances of lowering tuition costs, because students and professors are part of the same system.</p>\n<p>“They too are affected by the quality of their work based on tuition increase and class enrollment,” Singh said in an email. “The human interaction from a professor is lost in a large classroom, and instead it feels more like professor spewing information at us instead of active and engaging learning. And they know this.”</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, a third-year sociology major and rally organizer, said the tuition increases represent a failure of the state to support higher education. Mirza said he blames UC President Janet Napolitano for not exploring options other than raising tuition and said Brown has not prioritized higher education funding.</p>\n<p>“We are tired of public higher education coming at a private price,” Mirza said. “We are here because UC funding is too low a priority. We are not here to play political games of Jan Napolitano and Jerry Brown.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58709\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58709\" data-attachment-id=\"58709\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/protesters-convene-in-storke-plaza-for-rally-on-tuition/protests-on-ucsb-by-stephen-manga_for-11-21-2014-7475/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=1600%2C950&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,950\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416452272\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"28\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Protests on UCSB by Stephen Manga_for 11.21.2014-7475\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475.jpg?fit=888%2C527&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58709\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Protests-on-UCSB-by-Stephen-Manga_for-11.21.2014-7475-1024x608.jpg?resize=500%2C292\" alt=\"Protesters crowd the sixth floor of Cheadle Hall  as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael D.
