Freshman starting pitcher Robby Nesovic got through just three and a third innings, allowing six runs. However, just two were earned as the Gauchos defense lacked its usual reliability.</p>\n<p>“I thought Robby Nesovic gave us a chance. He threw the ball in there well,” Checketts said. “He should have gone five and given up just a run or two.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, now 16-14 and 3-3 in the Big West, had collected just one hit through six innings, but finally broke through in the bottom of the seventh inning as they put up two runs in the seventh, eight and ninth as they attempted a major comeback.</p>\n<p>With the score 7-4, sophomore pitcher Reed Reilly prevented a base hit from getting through the middle. He kicked a grounder and recovered to make the play, saving a run and making an important out as the Gauchos were just one base hit away from tying the game. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell struck out with the tying run on second to end the game.</p>\n<p>“We had a chance. We put pressure on them and they were backpedaling a little bit as we got our momentum going. I thought we were going to get a shot,” Checketts said. “It would have been nice to get a swing off on that last pitch, but there were some good at-bats by our guys to give us a chance.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos exploded for 13 runs as they went on to beat the Mustangs 13-2. Santa Barbara scored in the first inning, then went quiet until a huge 11-run sixth sealed the deal as the outburst brought 16 men to the plate.</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 4-4 on the day and drove in four runs as he led the team on the day, but sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward had nearly as impressive of a line as he went 4-5, scored three runs and drove in two, doubling and tripling in the process.</p>\n<p>Game one on Friday was a much closer game for the two teams. Cal Poly struck first in the top of the fourth inning on a home run by junior center fielder David Armendariz. The Gauchos came back in the bottom half of the fourth to tie it before taking the lead in the bottom of the sixth.</p>\n<p>UCSB tacked on some insurance runs in the seventh when Newell stole home on a double steal of third and home by Woodward and Newell respectively. Woodward then came home on a base hit by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa. Cal Poly scored again but ultimately fell 4-2.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to Malibu, as UCSB will head out to play Pepperdine Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50715\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/gauchos-take-series-over-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50715\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/gauchos-take-series-over-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/gauchos-take-series-over-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/gauchos-take-series-over-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/gauchos-take-series-over-rival-cal-poly/","id":4475,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4474,4473,4472],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Win Fifth Consecutive Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2757.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2757.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB baseball continues its roll after winning its fifth series in a row against Big West opponents, defeating Pacific on Friday and Sunday this weekend, but missing the sweep as the Tigers out pitche...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB baseball continues its roll after winning its fifth series in a row against Big West opponents, defeating Pacific on Friday and Sunday this weekend, but missing the sweep as the Tigers out pitched UCSB on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With the two wins this weekend, the Gauchos move to 31-22 on the year and 14-10 in the Big West.

In the eighth the Gauchos, who have become notorious in recent weeks for their comebacks, mustered a rally for one run, but junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon bounced into an inning ending double play and the Gauchos fell 3-2.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s home finale, the Gauchos put a seven spot on Pacific. UCSB wasted no time as they put up three runs in the bottom of the first with four consecutive singles.</p>\n<p>With the early lead sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Vasquez settled into one of his best starts of the year. Vasquez threw seven and a third shutout innings with five strikeouts en route to his second victory this season.</p>\n<p>In his home finale, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled and also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly helping his team to take the victory 7-3.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Venning said. “We needed to win this one; obviously all these games are important now.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to UCLA on Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page five of May 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/","id":4472,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4471,4470,4469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle in Final Big West Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A winless outing in Cal Poly capped off the final Big West Conference series for the UCSB baseball team this past weekend.

The Gauchos lost all three road games by a combined score of 29-14.</p>\n<p>With the losses, UCSB drops to No. 7 overall in conference with a 10-14 league record and a 24-27 mark overall. The Mustangs currently rank No. 3 with a 12-8 league record.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s series closer was the closest chance UCSB got to scraping together a win, yet Cal Poly was able to hold the lead through the ninth inning for a 9-8 victory. UCSB junior outfielder Brett Vertigan went two-for-four at the plate with one run and two RBIs, while senior outfielder Lance Roenicke went three-for-five with two runs and one RBI. Senior outfielder Joe Wallace led the Gauchos offensively on a three-for-four outing with two runs and one RBI in the game. Cal Poly senior shortstop Mike Miller went two-for-four on Sunday with two runs, while sophomore left fielder David Armendariz went three- for-four with one run. Cal Poly’s pitching staff allowed 17 hits on the day and gave up eight earned runs along with four strikeouts. UCSB’s Zak Edgington gave up five runs and 10 hits in six innings pitched, and Greg Mahle allowed four more runs in 1.2 innings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Friday’s series opener provided the stage for Cal Poly’s junior right-hander Joey Wagman to throw a complete game, allowing the Mustangs to secure a 5-1 win. Wagman allowed just one run on five hits, while UCSB’s starter Kevin Gelinas threw five innings and allowed five earned runs. Gelinas struck out three batters in the process.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs scored all five of their runs by the sixth inning, in which they led UCSB 5-0, and allowed only one run scored in the eighth. Vertigan led the Gauchos with two hits in four at-bats and one RBI, while freshman outfielder Luke Swenson scored UCSB’s only run of the game on Vertigan’s single. Saturday’s second game of the series saw UCSB give up the most runs to any team all season. Cal Poly’s 15 runs also mark a tie at the most that the Mustangs have scored this year (15 against Pacific on April 28). Eleven of the runs came in the fifth inning alone, an inning in which the Gauchos all but gave up the game to the Cal Poly offense. UCSB’s five runs came all in the second inning and highlighted a run sparked by Roenicke’s two-run double.</p>\n<p>The high-scoring fifth inning for Cal Poly was catalyzed by a combination of junior center fielder Mitch Haniger’s three-run home run and a three-run triple that gave the Mustang offense the advantage for the remainder of the game. Haniger currently leads the league in slugging percentage with a .616 average.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the practice field today in preparation for a home game against USC tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m., which will be the Gauchos’ final home game of the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/","id":4473,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4472,4471,4470],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Cal Poly in Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-by-Magali-Gauthier1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball-by-Magali-Gauthier1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team will jump back into conference action this weekend when rival Cal Poly comes to town.

Santa Barbara fell 7-0 in game one, took game two 7-3 then dropped game three 10-4.</p>\n<p>The 20-6 Mustangs hold the second-best overall record in the Big West Conference and are in a three-way tie for first at 3-0 in Big West action, while the Gauchos remain just about .500 with a 14-13 record and 1-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ offense played well in games two and three of the first series. Trinkwon, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa and sophomore left fielder Steven Fisher each homered in game two which was the biggest display of power the Gauchos have managed in a single game this year.</p>\n<p>However, game one was a much different story as the Gauchos were not only shut out, but ace pitcher sophomore Austin Pettibone was roughed up in the loss. It was the worst outing for Pettibone this year as he allowed six runs on 10 hits, two of them home runs.</p>\n<p>Opposite of Pettibone that day was senior pitcher Joey Wagman, who threw quite a gem for the Mustangs. Wagman allowed just two hits in seven innings while striking out 11 Gauchos en route to his fifth win of the year.</p>\n<p>Wagman is currently 6-1 with 59 strikeouts — tops in the Big West — in 46 innings and a .208 opponent batting average.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off of a sweep of UC Davis last weekend, a series in which the Mustangs senior second baseman Denver Chavez recorded seven hits in 15 at bats to boost his already impressive batting average to .390 and his 41 base hits lead the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will count on Pettibone to bounce back to form this weekend as he leads the Gauchos with a 2.92 earned run average through 48 and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Projected game two starter freshman Justin Jacome can make it two in a row against the Mustangs as he was the winning pitcher against Cal Poly a couple weeks ago when he allowed just three runs in six-and-a-third innings while striking out four.</p>\n<p>“[Our pitchers] can’t be scared. They need to come out and throw strikes and show off their stuff,” Trinkwon said. “We have great arms so if they are able to pound the zone and not be afraid, they should be fine.”</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green Rivalry continues this weekend with the first pitch set for Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium followed by a Saturday 2 p.m. game and the series finale will take place at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of April 4rth, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/ucsb-hosts-cal-poly-in-blue-green-rivalry-2/","id":4474,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4473,4472,4471],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
