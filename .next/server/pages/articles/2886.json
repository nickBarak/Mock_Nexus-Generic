During the presentation, Decker discussed various topics regarding PTSD, including the historical origins of the disorder, how combat affects soldiers, the difficulties soldiers face adjusting to life after duty and various PTSD treatments. During his talk, Decker, who has experience treating veterans from every war from WWII to Afghanistan, shared stories of individuals he had met and treated.</p>\n<p>Noting that he himself was not a veteran, Decker said civilians do not fully understand the extent of the psychological challenges veterans face.</p>\n<p>“[As] civilians, we’re so stupid, we don’t understand,” Decker said. “We don’t really want to understand. Civilians for the most part don’t want to know and they don’t really care. All we want is for you guys to just keep it to yourself, get over yourself, get on with your life.”</p>\n<p>Decker also said he has encountered many young veterans from Iraq who have expressed a desire to return to military life after service due to dissatisfaction with the banality of civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Think about it: in Iraq you’re armed to the teeth, you’ve got the power of life and death, the lives of your fellow men, fellow soldiers is in your hands. What could be more important, more meaningful?” Decker said. “Then you come back here. What do you have here? It’s an enormous statement about the meaningfulness of our culture.”</p>\n<p>Army veteran, Veterans and Military Services Coordinator and overseer of the Veterans Resource Center Kevin Hagedorn said services on campus seek to provide support for student veterans who are making the transition from service to college life.</p>\n<p>“As soon as we identify student veterans who are applying to UCSB, we make contact with them and try to help and facilitate their entry into UCSB,” Hagedorn said. “To getting admitted, to enrolling in classes, getting their GI Bill benefits and setting foot on campus.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Clinical Director at CAPS Kirsten Olson said there are many outreach programs for student veterans on campus to help with issues such as stress management.</p>\n<p>“We have staff psychologists who work with veterans,” Olson said. “They are welcome in our clinic and offer individual and group counseling. I work very closely with Kevin and our Veterans Resource Center to offer workshops for things like stress management, sleep habits and transitions to college.”</p>\n<p>Hagedorn said he had difficulties connecting with traditional students on campus after transitioning from military life to college life at CSU Chico after nine years of service in the army.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans are what we call non-traditional students, so they aren’t in the same pipeline as a lot of our students. Most of them are transferring from community colleges or they may have done school while they were in the military,” Hagedorn said. “When they come here to UCSB, they aren’t in the same loop that most of our students are. We want to make sure they get plugged into resources like CAPS, Disability Services, tutoring and career services.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

(Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus)</p></div>\n<p>Principal Researcher of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City Alicia Civera Cerecedo presented a lecture in HSSB on Monday night about the 2014 mass kidnapping of Ayotzinapa students in Iguala, Mexico, and giving a historical account of government corruption surrounding the incident.</p>\n<p>Titled “The Ayotzinapa Student Massacre and the Rural Teacher Training Schools in Mexico: A Historical Perspective,” the event drew around 100 attendees and covered the history of Mexico’s teacher training schools and the September disappearances of 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher’s College of Ayotzinapa. Cerecedo discussed the social movement that arose in Mexico after the kidnappings, the history of teacher training schools in Mexico and baseless narratives that are being forced onto teachers’ reputations by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of the population in Mexico over the age of 15 are in a situation of “lack of education or of not being fully educated,” and people who reside in rural areas have an average education of 6.4 years, according to Cerecedo. She also said Mexican youth are forced to enter cities or migrate to the U.S. because of acute poverty in rural Mexico, and many face challenging economic circumstances and must resort to the drug trade to survive.</p>\n<p>“The civil society is in a state of disbelief and the judicial process day-to-day becomes more apparent that it has been impeded,” said Cerecedo.</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, drug traffickers provide health services and security when the state fails to do so; however the line between government protection and drug cartel protection is becoming increasingly blurred. Cerecedo said drug trafficking is clearly becoming more integrated into the government entity.</p>\n<p>“In the case of Iguala, it became patently clear that drug trafficking is at all levels and in all types of government,” Cerecedo said. “Municipal, state, federal — in the executive, judicial and legislative. In the army as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the Mexican government is using corrupt forms of control and abusing their power by projecting societal problems of illiteracy and poverty onto the teachers. Cerecedo said the Mexican media, which is strictly controlled by the PRI regime, also blames teachers for the failures of the education system.</p>\n<p>Chaos surrounding the education system makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the Ayotzinapa Student Massacre, Cerecedo said.</p>\n<p>“The disappearance of the students happens at a time when you have social conflict and increasing social violence and an economic crisis all coming together,” Cerecedo said. “And it’s at a time when teachers are putting face against PRI authority or challenging the PRI.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the PRI came into power two years ago and has since targeted all opposing political parties or ideologies with hostility.</p>\n<p>“[The PRI] identifies all political parties as a political class without ideas,” Cerecedo said, “[They] are distributing power among themselves which results in a lot of corruption.”</p>\n<p>Cerecedo ended the lecture by saying that Mexico’s political system is essentially based on a “Constitution of a political system that no longer guards the people.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor in the history department and event translator Gabriela Soto Laveaga said she hopes the story of the missing students was thought-provoking for students on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s powerful because … the students who disappeared are your age,” Laveaga said. “I think that’s really poignant. Forty-three people disappeared and were tortured because they were studying.”</p>\n<p>Laveaga said the lecture highlighted to her the vital role student activists play in implementing social change.</p>\n<p>“I think we tend to be really disconnected out here. Sometimes we forget that in most countries its students are the activists,” Laveaga said. “It’s students who are really involved with social change. And maybe Mexico is not that far — it’s our neighbor to our south. And we could be a little more aware of the power of university students in other parts of the world.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Karla Estrada said she attended the event to get a different perspective on the events that unfolded during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to the event because I was aware of the massacre in Iguala and I wanted to get a first-hand account from the professor who is directly from Mexico City,” Estrada said. “She obviously has a really different perspective from professors here in the UC. A lot of my professors talk about what happened, but I felt like I just wanted to get her input.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Kreg Zaragoza said listening to Cerecedo’s lecture first-hand perspective was akin to receiving “insider information.”<br>\n“It’s good to hear from someone who is actually from Mexico,” Zaragoza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Instead, the senators fell into a disagreement after Ali Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, told the Senate at public forum that the resolution would be a “positional” and not “directional” piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional resolution “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events,” according to A.S. Legal Code. Typically, the Senate uses these resolutions to adopt an official stance on an issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional resolution, meanwhile, “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committees, and/or the Senate to specific duties” and usually moves to create an actual effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert pointed to individual parts of the resolution’s language, including a phrase about companies “profiting from human rights violations,” to justify her judgment that the resolution called for adopting a position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key difference between the two comes down to voting thresholds. While a positional resolution needs a two-thirds majority to pass, a directional resolution needs only a 50 percent plus one vote majority to be approved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That margin mattered to the divestment vote. Throughout the night, various votes to move the meeting forward stalled at 13-12. As a result, the Senate wound up discussing only the nature of the resolution itself and not its contents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, 13 senators did not want to approve the agenda, which would have codified the resolution as positional. Seeing that they wouldn’t budge, the other 12 senators did not come back from a recess, which forced an early end to the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Brandon Mora and Vanessa Maldonado co-authored the resolution, and students Naia Al-Anbar and Edan Tessema co-sponsored it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was intended to be directional, Maldonado said at the meeting. She emphasized she and Mora did not want the Senate to assume a position on the political or moral issue at the core of divestment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copies of the resolution provided by A.S. at the meeting stated that the resolution was directional. Sandhu, who chairs the Senate and has the authority to adjust resolutions, later changed it to be positional. Suebert, the A.S. attorney general, deemed it both directional and positional when she spoke at public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution will now be pushed either to next week’s meeting, an emergency meeting or an email vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Alexandra Gessesse and third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao, who substituted for Sophia Uemura, cited language used in past directional resolutions, such as a resolution to support last week’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/afscme-strike-comes-to-an-end-a-s-passes-resolution-in-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as having set a precedent for how directional resolutions should be written. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, you see the senators that came back to the table willing to have the conversation that was necessary to make sure the authors got due diligence, that the communities got due diligence and both sides on UCSB’s campus and all students involved got due diligence,” Gessesse told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse added that she felt the walkout disrespected Sandhu as the Senate chair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was disappointing to see people who I would think are committed to this campus, especially in terms of their commitments next year, to not be committed to working through student issues when I’m obviously committed to working on these student issues,” Dumlao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators who were approached for comment after walking out of the meeting asked to be contacted later in the day on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Mineiro, Sanya Kamidi and Maura Fox contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of the graphic in this story listed Adnan Mansur as Sami Kaayal’s proxy.

The Student Affairs Committee also listened to reports from the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) about a bill to create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students.</p>\n<p>The SFAC chair and fourth-year economics and accounting major Sean McKenzie said their group is separate from A.S. and is composed of 12 voting members, including two sophomores, two juniors, two seniors, two grad reps, two faculty and two staff representatives.</p>\n<p>“We are a committee under the Student Affairs Department, so we have nothing to do with Associated Students at all, even though we have Associated Students as our Ex-Officio Advisory members,” McKenzie said.</p>\n<p>According to McKenzie, the SFAC hears out public requests for departments for one-time projects such as maintenance requests, student health requests and more.</p>\n<p>“In Fall we open up public requests for those departments like the MultiCultural Center, the Rec Center, CAPS — there’s a whole list on our website actually,” McKenzie said. “So they come in [and] in the Fall they request money from us. We have a pot every year of money — it’s $285,000 each year, that’s based on a percentage of the student services fee. So based on that money, the Committee will allocate to these departments based on if they see fit whether they are going to improve the student life basically.”</p>\n<p>McKenzie also said all UC’s have a SFAC, and they meet up at various locations every quarter to work on campaigns.</p>\n<p>The Chair of the Senate Affairs Committee and second-year political science major Cassandra Mancini said SHAC had a meeting last Tuesday discussing the new meningitis vaccine, which would require three shots.</p>\n<p>“Last year, 50 percent of the student body got both shots, so that’s pretty cool. We’re very protected against Meningitis,” Mancini said. “But this new vaccine is not recommended — or you don’t have to get it if you got last year’s one — but, it would be good for new students and transfer students to get. So we will be offering that.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the new vaccine will cost money, but the amount is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>“It’ll just be in the Student Health Office, so anyone can get it at any time — it’s also not free like it was last year,” Mancini said. “They didn’t mention how much it costs. But also, I don’t know if insurance will cover it until next year, so that’s something that we might have to start talking about pretty soon.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the cost of getting the flu shot is rising, and there will be an official meeting on Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The costs of flu shots is being increased from $20-$30 for non-Gaucho Health Insurance people, and we talked about whether that was prohibitive or not,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the distance criteria will be extended to approximately 50 miles next year in order to include students who have Kaiser health insurance, which is currently not a sufficient alternative health care providers according to current GHI stantards, though MediCal students would still be denied.</p>\n<p>“Kaiser students can easily get waived,” Mancini said. “So that will be great for students because that was a big issue this year. Us and Santa Cruz are the only UC’s that didn’t have a Kaiser within a close distance.”</p>\n<p>FEC student representative and fourth year student Nikka Kurland said the Faculty Committee’s responsibilities include collecting information from end-of-the-quarter course assessments.</p>\n<p>“They review self-assessments from different departments and kind of like approve name changes [of] the department names like changes of majors and things like that,” Kurland said. “All the little surveys that you guys fill out at the end of each quarter,  like ranking the classes and stuff, basically that information does get compiled and people actually do look at it, and people actually take it very, very seriously.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Matthew Santos presented an amendment to add a second policy called “A Bill to Create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students” on to policy one in the A.S. Senate Bill.</p>\n<p>“Policy one would be created as the actual code of conduct with the A.S., all elected officials and the five bullets underneath,” Santos said. “The amendment that I would propose creates policy two under that.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the Code of Conduct had previously been voted on and approved by the Senate, but that the second policy in need of approval included the travel agreement under the five points for elected officials, appointed officials, general members and employees of A.S.</p>\n<p>According to Santos, the agreement would promote “professionalism, civility, respect and courtesy.”</p>\n<p>“We would just call that the A.S. Code of Conduct Travel Agreement… voted upon by the Senate, specific for traveling to events,” Santos said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58703\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58703\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/","id":2885,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2884,2883,2882],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
