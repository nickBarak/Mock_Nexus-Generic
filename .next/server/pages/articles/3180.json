Then once it passed a certain size, other people were like, ‘Oh, this is for everyone,’ and they felt more welcome to post,” Truong said.</p>\n<p>From the start, the page grew quickly.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t take long at all; we advertised it immediately on the other memes page, so everyone just came over,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>“It was like a snowball effect; even people from other schools wanted to join,” Ocampo added.</p>\n<p>The admins found that certain periods of the quarter, like midterm season, saw peaks in activity   because a lot of people were going through the same hardships that come with being a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“More people are likely to complain about the same thing, and because of that people are able to relate to [Overheard at UCSB] more, which contributes to the popularity,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>Overheard at UCSB quickly adopted a unique flavor in line with the campus itself and the community of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Each Overheard page has its own culture that kind of, like, reflects the culture of the college … at UCSB it’s kind of like a bit [of a] party school. You hear a lot of really inappropriate pieces of conversation,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>While Overheard at UCSB has grown organically with its community, the admins have had to exercise judgment in moderating content from certain users who have tried to hijack the page to sell products or simply commandeer the group.</p>\n<p>“There are rules in place for a reason. Sometimes people try to make it their own page … it’s not ‘Overheard from Someone Else,’ it’s Overheard at UCSB, and we want it to be about the campus, not a specific person,” Ocampo said.</p>\n<p>“There was a person on Overheard who posted multiple times a day, so we checked him out, and he doesn’t even go here. He, like, looked up facts to make the posts more relatable, and then he tried to sell them on apparel. We’ve blocked him twice,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>Still, the admins believe that the page has flowered into a thriving community.</p>\n<p>“I think, as long as people are willing to share their experiences, Overheard at UCSB has a place,” Chen said.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a copy editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 14, 2019 of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Director Jeanne Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Merchant, the demands played an integral role in her decision to work at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was inspired by the agency and activism of students to ask for what they need and to use their voices and resources to get their needs met.  I would not have left LA … if it had not been for the opportunity to respond to the call of Black students who were feeling unsupported, underrepresented, and invisible,” Merchant said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant, who grew up in Los Angeles but spent “15 summers in a row in Chicago where my parents were born,” said her parents moved to California to provide her with more opportunities than they believed she would have in Chicago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They instilled pride in being Black, demanded that I speak up for myself, and regularly told me that I could do anything that I put my mind to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a psychologist was a natural choice for Merchant, who said she has always been the person that friends confided in and looked to for advice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I chose to go to graduate school with the thought, ‘Everyone tells me their deepest darkest secrets and talks to be about anything, why not get paid to be me?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant’s areas of focus are women’s health, academic success, overall student wellness and “empowering and supporting students who may feel marginalized and specifically students from the African Diaspora,” according to the C.A.P.S. website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have always worked in settings in which I advocated for underrepresented populations and helped give voice to the voiceless,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant cited her own personal experiences as the reason she cares so much about helping others find solutions to their problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My personal reproductive trauma, having a daughter (Nailah Asha) that died the day before her first birthday in 2006, led to me learning the statistic that Black college educated women are twice as likely to have an infant die than a white woman who drops of out high school,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My loss and this data, fueled my passion for being part of the solution that reduces levels of stress of people who look like me (and anyone else I come in contact with) because too many babies and mothers are dying unnecessarily due to the structural and institutional racism across the life span, lived and passed on through generations, and it needs to stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant hopes to help Black students find peace and a sense of belonging and safety through counseling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At predominantly white serving institutions, more often than not, many students of color, and especially Black students find themselves fighting against being treated as inferior and as if they don’t belong before they even step into a classroom,” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students of color, particularly Black students, may not feel as comfortable asking for help as others for a variety of reasons, Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s a lack of trust in institutions, but there are also cultural stigmas for students of color who might be shamed for talking about their family’s private business or who worry about being called crazy, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is much easier to seek help if one feels as if someone understands their struggle and reduces the burden that students have felt to teach the counselor about the struggle to be Black at a white serving institution before they can get the help they need.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her time so far at UCSB, Merchant’s proudest accomplishment is establishing for Black students that she is there to support them and that she truly sees them. Since her and Barfield’s time at UCSB, Black students have utilized C.A.P.S. in larger numbers, Merchant said, and lately the program has been working to reach out to students more as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as she works to support Black students on campus, Merchant faces her own struggle on a predominantly white campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been lonely and overwhelming as the only Black female psychologist in CAPS,” she said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a Black staff member at UCSB mirrors the Black student experience in many ways and having community is essential and important for me too” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BSU Demands Team recently released a set of demands in early February, addressing the need for more Black student advocacy on campus, both institutionally and one-on-one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant believes the completion of these demands, particularly the construction of a building named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development,” would increase Black student retention and graduation in a significant way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that it would be very supportive, empowering, and meaningful for Black students to have a place that they can call their own, where they feel a sense of belonging, and are encouraged, in word and action, to be their best selves.  Where they are guaranteed to see people who look like them and to trust that their needs are important and their existence is validated,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a freestanding building for Black students was one written into the first demands released in 1968. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need to take more responsibility for our role in improving the mental health of all students.  This is not just the responsibility of psychologists in the counseling center but it is everyone’s responsibility,” Merchant wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, with respect to Black students who I believe make up the second smallest ethnic group on campus, greater efforts need to be made to create, sustain, and enrich the experiences and environment for Black students,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are people working independently on initiatives to improve Black student admission, retention and graduation rates, Merchant believes that centralizing those operations is key to being accessible to Black students who need help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also believes that while Student Affairs has prioritized diversity, inclusion and equity, individual professors and academic departments need to be held accountable for creating classrooms where Black students are not made to feel out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many Black students and other students of marginalized populations enter classrooms on the defense due to how they are treated by classmates as well as professors,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many professors are not held accountable for their complicit behavior and students suffer.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:12 a.m.]:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Merchant’s first name is Meridith, not Meredith.

id=\"caption-attachment-86227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vargas discussed several topics, most notably the concept of “home.” <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for UC Santa Barbara’s Student Affairs, spoke briefly before the lecture, explaining that its purpose was to zero in on the diversity of undocumented people not often represented in the media.</p>\n<p>Professor Lisa Sun-Hee Park, chair of the department of Asian-American Studies at UCSB, introduced Vargas by highlighting the significance of his lecture.</p>\n<p>“Almost thirty 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have made borders and walls essential fixture[s] of our national identity,” Park said.</p>\n<p>“It is an ineffectual shortcut and unimaginative copout from dealing with the realities of a global world.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ appearance comes at a time when the nation approaches the possibility of another government shutdown over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall.</p>\n<p>Vargas referenced this topic in his opening.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a privilege to be here tonight, considering the government may shut down again in the next couple of days, because we can’t seem to want to talk about immigration without talking about walls,” he said as he began his remarks to the crowd.</p>\n<p>The theme of the night’s lecture was “home.” Vargas used his allotted time to attempt to tease out the contradictions in how “home” is conceptualized as an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Vargas started the discussion by bringing up a seemingly trivial Bank of America email he received about his readiness to purchase a home.</p>\n<p>“I saw this email on my iPhone, and the subject line is, ‘Ready to buy a home?,’ and Trump had just gotten elected President,” he said. “At that point I heard from at least 30 undocumented people of all ages who are considering leaving the country.”</p>\n<p>Vargas said he had seriously considered leaving the United States for Canada, citing the prevalence of Filipinos in Toronto and the famous film festival named after the city.</p>\n<p>Then he received a letter from the chief of staff for Nancy Pelosi, current Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, inviting him to attend Trump’s first State of the Union as her guest.</p>\n<p>He spoke about his decision to publish an essay for the <i>Washington Post </i>jointly with his attendance, saying he felt it was risky considering Trump’s attitude toward immigrants, legal or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Vargas puts his contention to those opposed to his existence plainly, sharing the opening line of his previously published essay with the audience: “This is my country, too.”</p>\n<p>Vargas read aloud a passage from his essay explaining why he felt compelled to attend the State of the Union despite earlier considering relocating to Canada.</p>\n<p>“I decided to show up tonight [at the first State of the Union address] because that’s what immigrants, undocumented and documented, do: We show up. Despite the obvious risks and palpable fear we show up to work, to school, to church, to our communities, in big cities and rural towns.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86226\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86226\" data-attachment-id=\"86226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/activist-jose-vargas-comes-to-campbell-hall-discusses-experiences-as-an-undocumented-immigrant/immigration_riley-esguerra_online-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1405&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigration_Riley Esguerra_ONLINE-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=888%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86226\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=888%2C624\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vargas stressed the importance the immigration explosion presents historically, soberly noting the inability of “native-born” Americans to have this pressing conversation surrounding undocumented immigration.</p>\n<p>“This country can barely have a conversation about [the] Black Lives Matter Movement without having a panic attack. This country can’t even talk about Native Americans with any sort of nuance and any sort of import,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’re going to expect that this country can talk about 43 million people? It’s not a surprise that we are where we are.”</p>\n<p>Around 30 minutes into his lecture, Vargas addressed the central, basic question regarding immigration, legal or not: “Why do people move?”</p>\n<p>Vargas delved into issues with U.S. foreign policy, particularly that of imperialism and colonialism, regarding his home nation of the Philippines. He referenced a conservative Tea Party event in North Carolina that he attended, where he said his response to a condescending question about Filipinos presence in the U.S. was, “Sir, <i>we are here</i> because <i>you were there</i>.”</p>\n<p>Vargas also called attention to the different ways that mass movements of people are framed.</p>\n<p>“Why is it that when white people move it’s called courageous, necessary … Manifest Destiny [and] White Man’s Burden. Yet when people of color move, what’s the question? Is it legal? Is it a crime? Will they assimilate? When will it stop?”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of his talk, Vargas revisited his recent book and the process behind it, detailing how the separation of the book into the themes of lying, passing and hiding came about.</p>\n<p>“My editor did something that was really horrific. She said, ‘I want you to go home for the holidays and I want you to list the Top 20 most painful experiences of your life,’” Vargas said.</p>\n<p>“I listed 22. When I broke them out everything had to do with either lying, passing and hiding.”</p>\n<p>For Vargas, filling out an employment form for the San Francisco Chronicle was an especially poignant moment. At the time, Vargas was not a lawful permanent resident nor did he agree with the categorization of himself as an “alien.”</p>\n<p>Marking himself as a citizen would constitute perjury, as a sentence on the application reminded him. Despite this, he checked himself off as a citizen.</p>\n<p>“There was nothing else to check so I checked citizen, and whenever I checked it I actually convinced myself I was gonna go earn [citizenship].</p>\n<p>Vargas was told later by a lawyer this past offense — a false claim to citizenship — may be the reason he never becomes a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p>Even worse, he said he was ‘hiding’ from his mother, not having seen her in 25 years.

It passed unanimously during the meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“There is a lack of concept continuity among incoming AS Presidents which can perpetuate a culture of unfinished projects that may waste AS resources,” the bill states, arguing that Associated Students (A.S.) Presidents can be “limited” in their abilities to finish projects due to their one-year terms.</p>\n<p>The creation of the position was one of Kopel’s main projects that she hoped to accomplish during her term as A.S. President.</p>\n<p>“Particularly with this office, and especially my projects, [these] are definitely more long-term projects,” Kopel said in an interview with the <i>Nexus </i>earlier last week.</p>\n<p>“Having that position is really crucial in making sure that there’s no transition divide that would inhibit the projects from being carried through.”</p>\n<p>The position must be filled by someone who will be at UC Santa Barbara for the entirety of the 2019-2020 school year and is also familiar with the type of projects that the Office of the President takes on.</p>\n<p>The filling of the position is up to Kopel’s discretion, without prior approval from the Senate, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The position’s duties entail staying up to date on all of the president’s short-term and long term projects, meeting with the president once a week, meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez once a quarter, attending at least two Senate meetings per quarter, being in attendance and taking notes at all project-related meetings with the president, holding two office hours per week and serving at least four quarters over a span of two academic years.</p>\n<p>Kopel said that ideally she would transition one of her fellows into fulfilling that position.</p>\n<p>“Since all of my fellows are first-years, they will definitely be here next year and next Fall Quarter to transition or help the new president in any way that they can.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> held at the beginning of her term, Kopel said that being in A.S. for so long – first as a caseworker with the Office of the Student Advocate and then as a Letters and Science Senator for the 68th Senate – prompted her to create the position.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many fantastic ideas that students in these leadership positions [come up with] but cannot accomplish in a year,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“That’s shameful that you have something that would be so beneficial for this community, the campus community, and it’s literally just not accomplished because there’s bureaucratic issues.”</p>\n<p>She admitted that the position may not fix the projects problem entirely, but believes that “attempting it would be a great start.”</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:20 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
