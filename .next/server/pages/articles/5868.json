Making SBIFF history, Larson called in via Skype to recount her history as an actress.</p>\n<p>“I started auditioning when I was six or seven years old,” she said. “Been at this for about 20 [years]. It’s been a very long road, but I wouldn’t want it to be any different. I wouldn’t change it — it brings me closer to who I am.”</p>\n<p>After a year of acting in plays, her mother got her an agent and she started appearing in fake commercials for Jay Leno.</p>\n<p>Larson got her first big break in “The United States of Tara” as Kate Gregson, a role she was initially rejected for. “It set me on my path,” she said. She would go on to co-star in “21 Jump Street,” “Short Term 12” and “Room,” the film she was awarded for.</p>\n<p>For her role as Ma, a woman kept captive with her son in a shed for seven years, Larson lost fat and gained muscle and consulted with a trauma specialist. She described how she and discovered the film on an emotional level as shooting went on. Like her character’s son Jack, she ended up missing the warm security of “Room” after the crew moved out into the chilly cityscape of Toronto.</p>\n<p>Larson graciously accepted her Outstanding Performer of the Year Award before leaving the call to catch her plane.</p>\n<p>Then, Saoirse Ronan, clad in white, walked onstage with a box of popcorn. As she sat down, she said, “I just realized Brie and I are wearing the same dress,” much to the audience’s amusement.</p>\n<p>The actress, famed for “Atonement” and “The Host,” was awarded for the romantic drama “Brooklyn” — which is where she was born, according to the moderator.</p>\n<p>Not so, Ronan corrects him: she came from the Bronx. “Obviously. Clearly I was born in the Bronx. Could you not tell by my sassy attitude?”</p>\n<p>Like her character Eilis Lacy, Ronan’s parents were Irish immigrants. Her mother worked as a nanny and her father worked a variety of jobs, including actor, bartender and construction worker.</p>\n<p>One of her first acting gigs came when her father cast her in a surrealist short film. “I started acting when I was very young. Being exposed to a group of young, creative people who interacted with me when I was a kid inspired me to be like them.”</p>\n<p>Ronan’s early experience made her adept at accents, which she demonstrated to the audience by adopting typical Valley Girl twang. She would go on to star in “Atonement” alongside Keira Knightley, which earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>She later played the teenage assassin Hanna in the film of the same name. Ronan recounted doing weightlifting and practicing martial arts for the role. A clip played, showing her killing Michelle Dockery’s character. “I snapped Lady Mary’s neck,” she tells a laughing audience. “So sorry.”</p>\n<p>For “Brooklyn,” Ronan was able to deeply sympathize with her character. She eventually moved away from her family to live in London and became very homesick.</p>\n<p>“There was a part in a movie when I tell Jim Broadbent ‘I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.’ I know that feeling … everyone’s come from someplace else. We need to make that first step out the front door, and it’s frightening.”</p>\n<p>Then event concluded with SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling taking the stage to sing the praises of Ronan, causing her to tear up as she graciously accepted her golden trophy.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point of taking a photo now, my makeup’s ruined. It’s important me to remember how important the work is and how important it is to make film and stories on stage or a film set. It’s what I love to do, and I get to work with wonderful people. Thanks for listening to us go on for the last hour. I hope you have a nice night, and thank you for coming.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/the-edge-of-glory-ronan-and-larson-awarded-at-sbiff/","id":5868,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5867,5866,5865],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"SBIFF Women’s Panel","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CbHkgs9UcAAMZtH.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CbHkgs9UcAAMZtH.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The Women’s Panel was held in the Lobero theater on February 13th, the final day of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

The guests included Rosa Tran, Shannon McIntosh, Liz Garbus, Alison Eastwood, Svetlana Cvetko and Susan Cartsonis. They talked about their careers and the films they were being awarded for with moderator Madelyn Hammond. She created the panel and has been moderating it for thirteen years.</p>\n<p>Tran produced “Anomalisa,” a stop-motion film directed by Charlie Kaufman and received an Oscar nomination for her work. She described her progression through the industry: she went to film school, paying her way through as a manicurist. After working in reality TV, she became a writer’s assistant on Comedy Central and became a puppet coordinator for Robot Chicken. “Anomalisa” co-director Duke Johnson showed her the film’s script, convincing her to produce.       When asked about what was difficult about the production, Tran replied, -“[Keeping everyone together] was tough. There was someone crying her eyes out in the parking lot. You tell her she’s amazing and that this hasn’t been done before, and we’ll figure it out together.”</p>\n<p>Shannon McIntosh produced “The Hateful Eight,” working alongside Quentin Tarantino, whose enthusiasm she described as “infectious.” She is a former employee of pre-Disney Miramax. “I had a work ethic that was unparalleled for anyone who worked there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>McIntosh described how one of the greatest difficulties that came out of “Eight” was the fact that there were only around a dozen working 70mm cameras in the United States. As that was the format Tarantino wanted the film to be shown in, McIntosh had to scrounge together parts from other cameras in order to make sure there would be enough projectors to screen the film in.</p>\n<p>Garbus is a renowned documentarian. Her Oscar-nominated film, “What Happened, Miss Simone?” chronicles the life and career of jazz singer and activist Nina Simone. It was made over a period of 13 months and released on Netflix.</p>\n<p>When she was in high school, she made her own documentary and showed it at a party, where a PBS producer was in attendance. Afterwards, she studied film at college. A meeting with a prison journalist led her to Angola State Prison, where Garbus met and talked to ten inmates. The resulting documentary “The Farm: Angola, USA,” earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>Eastwood is the daughter of film legend and fellow director Clint Eastwood. -“My brother and I grew up on set,” she said. Her picture “Battlecreek” involves a romance between a girl and a boy with a skin disease.</p>\n<p>While watching the production of her father’s films, Eastwood felt a need to get involved in film. “I wanted to pay attention. I didn’t want to just sit around.” Ever since, she’s done, “… a lot of good movies, a lot of crappy movies. I learned what not to do. I wanted to produce and develop.”</p>\n<p>“Battlecreek’s” script had to be refined over the course of several months and re-started altogether when the original production fell apart. “The passion [keeps me going],” Eastwood said. The production was ultimately saved when someone wrote a check for the whole film.</p>\n<p>Yugoslavian native Cvetko works on films as a cinematographer. She started out as a camera assistant on a film set. Later, she went to India to make a short film, which was shown at Sundance.</p>\n<p>Like Gaarbus, Cvetko works on documentaries. “In [that] world, the team is very very small. Personal, tight.” Most crews are male, “but there are some amazing women kicking ass out there.” Cvetko says sometimes, she has to convince her male crewmembers that she is on their side.</p>\n<p>Cartsonis is the president of production company Storefront Pictures. She attended both UCLA and NYU, deciding she wanted to be a scriptwriter. She ended up getting a job reading scripts at 20th Century Fox, reading up to four a day.</p>\n<p>She went on to attract the attention of Scott Rudin, a film producer. After asking her to be his assistant, Cartsonis called him back and, at the urging of her boss, said, “I want to be an executive.”</p>\n<p>“Okay,” Rudin replied. Cartsonis gained the title of “Untitled Creative Executive,” later becoming a Senior Vice President of Production.</p>\n<p>Despite her high position in the film world, she described how it can sometimes be difficult to acquire funds to make films, something the other panelists agreed with. “You have to figure out the ways that are natural to you to ask for money.” She recently made “Carrie Pilby,” a Kickstarter-backed film.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the event, Hammond asked the filmmakers if they had any pearls of wisdom to share.</p>\n<p>Eastwood’s stood out the most: “If there’s something you want to do, do it. Visualize it. Do whatever you have to do to make it happen.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/","id":5865,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5864,5863,5862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek Reviews Deadpool","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ty0neic0o4jqee5oms8e-e1456371428887.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ty0neic0o4jqee5oms8e-e1456371428887.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1","description":"“Everyone, please turn around and welcome Ryan Reynolds!” A resounding crack echoes inside I.V.

Hey, they may have slaughtered the Fantastic Four, but at least they know how to market their shit.</p>\n<p>Then the screen goes dark and the comic book nerds shush their talkative neighbors. The film begins. “Angel of the Morning” plays and the film immediately lets us know what we’re in for as credits like “Starring God’s Gift to Man” and “Directed by Some Overpaid Tool” appear.</p>\n<p>Yup, “Deadpool” has arrived, a year and a half after I watched the leaked concept video during orientation. In its journey from CGI “what if” to Ryan Reynold’s flesh-and-blood crotch taking up most of the screen, the titular antihero has not lost an inch of his psychopathic charm.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is what anchors the film. Deadpool himself is impossibly hilarious. Nobody is safe from his sarcastic observations and scathing references. “Oh, your poor wife,” he moans after he punches the chrome colossus that is, well, Colossus in the balls. Ryan Reynolds has pitch-perfect delivery, although his performance is not all shits and giggles. There’s still enough emotional weight to his character that gives him motivation and humanity behind the burned casserole that is his face.</p>\n<p>That’s more I can say for the villain. Ajax (or Francis, as Deadpool vehemently insists on calling him) is about as interesting and amusing as a boiling pot of water. His only purpose is to provide Deadpool more material to work with. It’s a little disappointing that the film’s villain has absolutely no motivation, no good lines and, contrary to my friend’s insistence, has the sex appeal of roadkill. (Then again, aren’t all Marvel villains barring Loki like that?) It was a lot more gratifying to see Deadpool annihilate Rob Liefeld than watch these two mutants violently cross blades.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, you may be wondering: does “Deadpool” live up to its R-rating? Believe it or not, Marvel’s Netflix series actually seems gorier in comparison. That’s because whereas “Daredevil” treats its violence very seriously, “Deadpool” turns a man cutting off his own hand into a gag. But fear not, for there is definitely enough decapitations and blood to go around.</p>\n<p>As for the graphic nudity front, I can say that both boys and girls will probably come away turned on, but the women may have to look a little harder. Whereas the boobs are all well-lit thanks to the neon-pink strip club lighting, Deadpool’s wang is obscured in shadow. And, just saying, I only looked out for his dong for the sake of this review. I swear. Really. You should be thanking me.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful (yeah, lame transition, I know) that “Deadpool” is a riot. The jokes keep coming like a gift that keeps on giving. There’s such a wide variety of humor on display: satires of superhero movie tropes, parodies of John Hughes movies, Fawlty Towers references(!), incredibly violent slapstick and of course, a lot of penis humor.</p>\n<p>The movie’s humor, however, is not groundbreaking by any means. It still adheres to that annoying cliché of stopping the action and cutting out the music, which is basically the overpaid tool’s way of saying, “Laugh, goddammit, laugh.”</p>\n<p>Contrary to the marketing, the film is not a straight laugh train. Half of the time, both the movie and Deadpool himself steer into typical superhero melodrama. For what’s here, it works, but there’s not quite enough substance for my pretentious tastes. Deadpool has motivation, sure, but the villains don’t. The villains are there to look mean and act likewise. It’s a movie of halves.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean half the movie sucks; it’s undeniably entertaining. Deadpool is not the messiah of superhero comedy; it’s flawed, but it definitely takes advantage of its hard R to the best possible extent. The badass Merc with a Mouth is unashamedly immature and is all the more awesome for it. I definitely don’t regret waiting for an hour and a half for my ticket. Go see “Deadpool” and make it rain for 20th Century Fox.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

beginning to worry that Johnny Depp might not show up to collect his Maltin Modern Master award from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. A no-show would have been uncharacteristic of someone who Scott Cooper, the director of Depp’s latest film “Black Mass,” described as “one of the kindest, most soulful, most generous men that [he knows],” and true to form, Depp eventually arrived. Depp was rushed past reporters and into the Arlington Theatre by his handlers, although he made an attempt to answer a few questions along the way.</p>\n<p>This effort on his part was surprising since, as Leonard Maltin, the film critic for whom the award is now named, pointed out at the start of the evening, Depp is notorious for avoiding press. “People have said in the past week or so: ‘Johnny Depp doesn’t do things like this,’ which he doesn’t,” Maltin said, although even without this observation, it would have been obvious to most people in the audience. Depp was visibly nervous and fidgeted throughout the evening with his rings, hair, sunglasses and, most notably, his black and white HUF Plantlife socks. For much of the first portion of the interview, he stared down at his hands, peering sideways at Maltin or up at the audience to see if one of his numerous jokes got the right reaction.</p>\n<p>For the most part they did, although some of his more bizarre jokes were lost on Maltin, and this seemed to boost his confidence. By the time Maltin and Depp were halfway through their hour-and-a-half long interview, Depp’s body language had opened up. He was looking at and interacting with the audience more, affectionately imitating former co-stars and, on two occasions, gesturing so enthusiastically that he knocked his own microphone. Depp even joked, un-annoyed, with the one bizarre heckler of the evening, who told the actor to “grow more things.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I grow things,” Depp said, adding, “Might not be the same things that you’re growing,” although his socks implied otherwise.</p>\n<p>This was in contrast to Maltin, who stayed in almost the same rapt position throughout the interview and seemed a bit awestruck by Depp. He didn’t interject often, content to listen to Depp’s rambling, often inconclusive but entertaining stories and, when he did interrupt, it was to introduce one of the many movie clips that interspersed their conversation or to prod Depp for the end of a sentence. It’s possible that Depp could have used a bit more prodding, however, since the event went on so long that some people started leaving and at least one woman fell asleep in her seat. This could also have had something to do with the sheer number of movies Depp has in his repertoire — over 40 at this point — and Maltin even apologised at the start they could not show clips from all of his works.</p>\n<p>Clearly Depp shared the opinion that the interview went on too long, though, since he started rolling a cigarette about forty minutes in and had it in his hand until the end. He may have lost his initial shyness and expressed sincere gratitude that he was “lucky enough to meet [his fans] outside and across the globe” but it remained obvious that he dislikes press and the general trappings of fame. He apologized for his awkwardness at the end, saying “I’m not good at this stuff … Stuttering and stammering — I don’t know, they haven’t really diagnosed it yet,” and mentioned being disguised with prosthetics in order to “take his kids to the London Eye without people looking at [him like he’s] Johnny Depp.”</p>\n<p>Still, Depp’s assessment that he is not good at interviews was perhaps too self-critical. Over 90 minutes he walked the audience through his entire career, starting with his stint as a TV actor on “21 Jump Street,” right up to the present day. He related how unhappy he was acting for TV, “where you can only play one character for a long period of time” and end up “being a product,” along with the bizarre ways he tried to get fired, including refusing to remove a turban or inventing a peanut butter obsession for his character. He went on the describe his “instant” connection and three-hour-long conversation with Tim Burton, after seeing him at the coffee shop where they had agreed to meet “with his hair looking like there was an explosion at a hardware store and … chewing on his coffee spoon. I walk into a joint, I know that’s the guy I’m talking to,” Depp said of the encounter, “Even if it’s not Tim Burton.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Depp had glowing things to say about everyone he has worked with and even his insistence that Al Pacino is “certifiably insane” was more loving than not. He was particularly emotional about the late Marlon Brando, whom he described as “a hero, a father, a mentor, a brother and a friend.” He again demonstrated his distaste at some aspects of the industry, though, when describing how his agent received a call after his friend’s death, asking if he now wanted to release “The Brave,” the movie he had produced and starred in with Brando some years earlier. Depp was disgusted at this attempt to have Brando “exploited and looked upon as a freak or some novelty,” a sentiment that merited a lot of applause from the audience. That said, the film’s abysmal reception when it premiered at Cannes could also have contributed to this decision, although Depp clearly isn’t afraid of making mistakes and claimed at the end that the possibility that “[he] could fall flat on [his] face” is a vital part of being an actor.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the event made clear that Johnny Depp has not only achieved a staggering amount of success but has also done a lot to earn it, including trying to contract heat stroke to perfect the reeling swagger of Captain Jack Sparrow. He remained humble, however, making constant references to the hard work of his agent of 30 years, Tracy, and avoided any hints of pretentiousness. He was particularly flippant about method actors, who he envisaged “at the craft table refusing to eat those Doritos because [they’re] Henry the Eighth,” and said that he knows he’ll see them “in the bar later, because [they’ve] got more problems than [he does].”</p>\n<p>A similar humility was displayed by Leonard Maltin who, though not an international film star, had reason to think highly of himself, since it was his first time conducting the Modern Master interview since the award was renamed in his honour and he was described by Mark Scher, the president of SBIFF, as a “rockstar.” Maltin, though, attributed his success as a film critic to having “broke in at the right time” when it was still possible to become established through “old school print journalism,” stating that he “wouldn’t want to be breaking in today … [since] the internet’s changed everything.” Maltin arrived at the red carpet with his daughter as his date and was affable and eager to talk to everyone, which was probably why he got on well with Depp, who could be seen leaning over to talk to him while the film clips were playing.</p>\n<p>The interview ended with Black Mass director Scott Cooper appearing on stage to heap more compliments on Depp, who bashfully deflected these by making the “make it rain” gesture after being called generous. Depp, having accepted his award, said he was “lucky to get away with everything [he] got away with over the years” and focused on the “talent … [and] brilliance of men like Leonard Maltin.” Cooper, however, who said he’d “travelled the world espousing the virtues of Johnny Depp,” insisted that “there really is no one like Johnny” and called him “the most overlooked actor of the year” in reference to his Oscar snub. From the response this got from a, by that point, very tired audience, it was clear they agreed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68124\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68124\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/sbiff-awards-johnny-depp-with-modern-master-award/","id":5867,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[5866,5865,5864],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
