The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.”</p>\n<p>Those were some of the opening lines of Malcolm X’s speech at the funeral of Ronald Stokes in 1962.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 56 years to 2018, Kimberlé Crenshaw would argue X’s statements still ring true.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, April 25, attendees at Campbell Hall heard the words of Crenshaw, who popularized the concept of “intersectionality” nearly three decades ago. The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

After a screening of S02E06, “You Also Have a Pizza,” the director, film and media studies faculty member Allison Anders, held a Q&amp;A session ending with a reception in the lobby. The event was co-sponsored by the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and the Department of Film and Media Studies and Davidson Library’s “UCSB Reads,” which chose Kerman’s memoir as this year’s campus-wide reading selection.</p>\n<p>When film and media studies faculty member Cynthia Felando asked Anders how she began watching the show, Anders said “OITNB” is one of the few shows she has “binge watched.”</p>\n<p>“I watched everything and I thought it was a really brilliant pilot, and of course I loved the fact that there was so many women in one show. It was amazing to me,” Anders said. “I love it that Piper was so well equipped for prison — it was just like the greatest thing to me that all of her sort of yuppified, kind of hipster stuff was not going to fly in prison. But yet it also became how she coped.”</p>\n<p>Anders said race, class and age are balanced in the series, and that the characters’ shared situation equalizes their different backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“That is the genius of Jenji Kohan, who created the show,” Anders said. “Whether it is a guard or inmate, there is a humanity there. There is a heart under that, there is a person who is struggling, and I thought that was just amazing with these characters — all of the characters, really.”</p>\n<p>Responding to an audience member’s question, Anders said she is an active feminist in the midst of the film industry’s gradual acceptance of women in the business.</p>\n<p>“I do feel like it is getting better,” Anders said. “It gets better in small increments each year. It is remarkable how far behind the industry is, and I do not understand why.”</p>\n<p>Felando said Anders, who has directed films such as “Gas Food Lodging” (1992) and “Mi Vida Loca” (1993), and episodes of “Sex in the City”, “The L Word” and “The Mentalist,” has had a full and fulfilling career.</p>\n<p>“Film and episodic television, and now streaming with Netflix,” Felando said. “It is like the gamut.”</p>\n<p>Assistant University Librarian for Outreach and Academic Collaboration Rebecca Metzger said UCSB Reads has brought people together with its screening of “OITNB”.</p>\n<p>“UCSB Reads is meant to bring the UCSB and Santa Barbara communities together to read and discuss a common book,” Metzger said in an email. “While the UCSB Library plans and hosts most of the programming, we encourage others on campus and in the community to organize their own events around the book, too.”</p>\n<p>Campus groups such as the Literature Club and the Queer Book Club have read OITNB, and the Associated Students campaign Invest in Graduation Not Incarceration, Transform Education (I.G.N.I.T.E.) hosted events focusing on the book, according to Metzger.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had faculty from the Department of Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology talking about local rehabilitation programs for inmates, and faculty from the Theater &amp; Dance Department talking about empowering incarcerated youth through theater and faculty from English and the Writing Program talking about the drama of prison narratives,” Metzger said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Reads had a speaker from the university Office of Judicial Affairs talk about how the restorative justice process is applied on campus to students who violate university policy.</p>\n<p>“That discussion was attended by many students in the Teacher Education Program on campus who wanted to know how to apply restorative justice to the K-12 setting,” Metzer said.</p>\n<p>Through UCSB Reads, Metzger said restorative justice issues have been brought to a local level and made meaningful for students in their work and research.</p>\n<p>“You only have to stop by the lobby of the UCSB Library to view our exhibition of photographs of girls in the juvenile justice system by Art Professor Richard Ross and read the comment book to understand the impact of these issues to our students and community,” Metzger said in an email. “There are students here who have been in juvenile facilities, or whose parents or other family members have been in or are in prison.”</p>\n<p>The last UCSB Reads event on Orange is the New Black will be Wednesday, April 15 at 8 p.m. when Orange is the New Black author Piper Kerman will deliver a free, public talk titled “The Real Story Behind ‘Orange Is the New Black’” at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The meeting also addressed the success of this year’s Deltopia festivities and the continuing security of I.V. in future years with regard to the festival.</p>\n<p>The reputation and presence of Greek organizations on campus was also discussed, with an emphasis on looking toward greater unity between Greek organizations and the university for future events.</p>\n<p>The senators heard from representatives from C.A.P.S about the organization’s future plans and needs. Assistant Clinical Director of C.A.P.S Turi Honegger said a new wellness center is going to open in I.V. in 2015.</p>\n<p>“I have seven offices that are going into Isla Vista,” Honegger said. “It’s going to be above the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic. Four of those offices are going to be dedicated to full-time psychologists. That will be available for all students and any I.V. resident can get a consultation.”</p>\n<p>According to Honegger, the C.A.P.S program is very popular with a significant portion of the student body, bringing in nearly 25 students for initial mental health assessments on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>“That’s over one hundred a week, and over the course of a quarter that’s over five percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S Student Mental Health peer Janice Ong said the mental health peer program could use more space.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing as best we can to provide mental health services to students, but expansion can be done in this situation,” Ong said. “For example, as of now we don’t have a dedicated space for students to come in to talk, usually when drop-ins happen we try our best and maybe a clinician can give up their office for twenty minutes for us to use.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy introduced the Senate to the Dear Governor Brown campaign which starts Friday and aims to educate students regarding the “financial irresponsibility within the UC system stemming from Governor Brown’s plans for higher education.” The campaign mainly focuses on his plans for expediting graduation and expanding online education.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the irresponsible use of information by the governor’s office is “disconcerting” to the A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“The governor’s office has desired to increase summer sessions as a way to expedite graduation rates,” Guthy said. “But they weren’t aware that Pell grants and other aids don’t cover summer sessions. And summer sessions are usually more expensive because they are paid by units.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said she is concerned about the lack of a long-range budget planning for the UC system which is aggravated by Brown’s endeavor to make budget allocations on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>“They acknowledged that they did not have long term vision when they were planning the budget,” Guthy said. “When you’re conceding that you don’t have long term vision when you’re funding a major institution like University of California, it’s seriously problematic.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the governor is cutting funds from the wrong places, and she disagrees with the suggested changes.</p>\n<p>“The governor is being insistent on trimming the fat of the UC,” Guthy said. “Unfortunately, it seems like the ‘fat’ he is trying to trim is the student resources and services that we get. I would characterize it as trying to industrialize the student experience. Moving it [education] online and making it faster doesn’t make it better.”</p>\n<p>Guthy discussed the halted plans for redesigning the A.S. main entrance, saying A.S. would seek funding from alternative sources for the proposed new entrance from campus to the A.S. main office due to its predicted cost amounting to $10,000 as opposed to the projected $5,000.</p>\n<p>“My plan is to go to the UCen Governance Board and talk with them about potentially contributing to the design and funding, if that’s something we’re still interested in pursuing,” Guthy said, “because there is a renovation fund for the UCen, so I’m curious to see if they would be willing to contribute to that project.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk spoke to the Senate about Deltopia’s success and the upcoming planning for next year’s event to ensure continued success of the event. Schunk said he is currently recruiting participants from the Office of Student Life in order to get involvement from a diverse pool of students.</p>\n<p>“This coming week we are going to be having what I am calling ‘Del-scussion,’” Schunk said. “It’s going to be an opportunity for everyone to get together and have a dialogue about what they liked about this Deltopia and what they really didn’t like.”</p>\n<p>Schunk discussed updates on district boundary bill AB 3, saying consensus had been reached on taxation powers. Schunk also said funding was coming from the Fund for Santa Barbara, The Santa Barbara Foundation, Santa Barbara County, the university and Assemblymember Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>“Were still working on deciding on board structure and actual boundaries of the district,” said Schunk. “The issue is not so much where is the money coming from anymore. It’s who’s the financial host going to be.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also discussed a tentative plan for Greek organizations within I.V., suggesting a series of Greek workshops centered around educating Greek life on their responsibility to the campus and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Part of the goal there is to empower Greek students and make them feel as if they can be stewards of this community,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>The senators also voiced different opinions on whether UCSB Extension students who do not pay A.S. fees should be able to attend student-only events like Extravaganza.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said extension students should be allowed to attend with additional fees.</p>\n<p>“They could be allowed to attend, but they would have to pay,” Lau said. “So for example, The Warm-Up was five dollars for us, but Extension students would pay way more than that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology and feminist study double major Daisy Fernandez said allowing extension students into campus events could open the door for too many non-affiliated students.</p>\n<p>“Program Board does not like this idea at all because this opens the door to other people, like SBCC students or members of the public saying, ‘Hey they get to buy tickets, why don’t we get to buy tickets?’” Fernandez said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Brooks has been featured on ”PBS News Hour” and “All Things Considered” on NPR and has written several best-selling books.</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, two sets of virtue exist: “résumé virtues,” which he characterizes as qualities people bring to their jobs, and “eulogy virtues,” which Brooks said are characteristics people value in a deceased person.</p>\n<p>“Most people today are clear on how to have a good career, but not really clear on how to have a good eulogy,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>Brooks went on to say résumé virtues and eulogy virtues are in tension with each other, causing individuals who pursue good résumés to lose their ability to have a good eulogy.</p>\n<p>“[If you pursue résumé virtue] you turn into a shroud animal. You lack inner depth. You forget how to speak with a moral vocabulary. You live as an unconscious organism not really attached to the highest ideals, and you settle for a moral mediocrity,” Brooks said. “You’re not deserving of the eulogy you want, which only comes from an unfakeable virtue.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, people can overcome “moral mediocrity” by first confronting themselves and weighing their values on morals that he alleged have become less common in today’s culture.</p>\n<p>“To have that inner happiness, or even approach it, you have to step outside the ‘big me’ culture and you have to step back into a different moral collage, which used to be more common than now and which is based on a profound honesty about yourself,” Brooks said. “Character is built over the course of this confrontation with yourself.”</p>\n<p>Brooks also said stepping toward “inner happiness” comes from receiving help from others, rather than searching for self-help.</p>\n<p>“Character is not inside — no one is really strong enough to defeat selfishness or defeat self-obsession,” Brooks said. “We all need help from outside.”</p>\n<p>According to Brooks, pursuing virtue by self-confrontation and help from others makes it possible to escape the stresses and conflicts of a life of moral mediocrity.<br>\n“It is possible to go from scattered life to a really good life,” Brooks said.</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Leslie Medina said she was surprised that Brooks spoke on virtue, despite his reputation as a prominent political pundit.<br>\n“I feel like his talk was a little wishy-washy,” Medina said. “I wasn’t expecting what it came out to be.”</p>\n<p>Medina said she was glad she was able to attend Brooks’ lecture because he made profound points on the moral structure of modern culture.</p>\n<p>“I’m still glad I went because he had a lot of important things to say about society,” Medina said. “It left me with a lot to think about.”</p>\n<p>Second-year earth science major Ryan Kelleher said he particularly enjoyed when Brooks explored his characterization of eulogy virtue in today’s society.</p>\n<p>“I think he’s right in saying that people today just aren’t all that moral,” Kelleher said. “Virtue is something that everyone, especially college students, needs to keep in mind.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/brooks-discusses-death-careers-at-campbell/","id":2848,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2847,2846,2845],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
