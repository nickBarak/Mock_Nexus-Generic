UCSB was down 4-0 as early as the first inning as freshman pitcher Shane Bieber struggled settling in. The Gaucho offense was kept in check by the Highlanders’ senior relief pitcher Dylan Stuart. Stuart entered the game in the fourth inning and had command of his four pitches to keep hitters guessing throughout his 5.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“They came out and scored four in the first; that’s usually tough to rebound from,” Woodward said. “Those are big momentum swings. We added on and responded and scored in the same inning — in the first — but it’s tough when you have a deficit like that early on. I think some things didn’t go our way (yesterday).”</p>\n<p>UCSB mounted a come-from-behind 6-5 win on Saturday after erasing a two-run deficit. Down 5-3 in the sixth inning, the Gauchos got the ball rolling on a double that brought junior outfielder Cameron Newell home from first base.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders went down quietly in the top of the seventh inning, Santa Barbara began the bottom half with consecutive singles to put runners on first and second base. UCSB was quick to capitalize on the situation when UCR committed a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt that brought in the runner from second. With one out and the scored tied, Newell gave UCSB the lead with an RBI groundout before the inning ended.</p>\n<p>Now with a one-run lead, Head Coach Andrew Checketts elected to bring in his shutdown closer, sophomore Dillon Tate, for the two-inning save. The right-hander had his usual stuff working and converted his tenth save of the season, with five of the six outs recorded coming by way of strikeout.</p>\n<p>“We rely on Dillon to do that when he comes in the game,” junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “We think he’s going to get it done. It wasn’t a surprise to any of us how he performed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was in full control in the series’ opening game on Friday, coming out with a 6-2 win behind the stellar pitching of sophomore Justin Jacome. Jacome tossed 6.1 innings of three-hit ball and gave up only two runs on the day to improve his record to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>“He did a good job throwing strikes and pounding the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He struggled a little bit with his command early and was able to find it; he did a good job.”</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris led the way offensively for Santa Barbara with a three-hit performance. Maris tripled in the first inning to bring in a runner from first base and then came home on a sacrifice fly to give UCSB a 2-0 lead. Maris once again came to bat with a runner on second in the sixth inning and singled to left field to tack on another run for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCR got back to into the game with a two-run seventh inning, however, Santa Barbara countered with a three-run effort in the bottom half to push its lead to 6-2 and put away the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play UCLA at home on Tuesday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/","id":4715,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4714,4713,4712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 13 UCSB Takes Series Against Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 13 Gauchos won the series against the No. 19 Titans 2-1.

Both kept batters off balance by throwing breaking pitches, with Mazza’s curveball helping him get through 5.2 innings of relief and not allowing a run. The left-hander improved to 3-2 on the season after coming in for freshman starter Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to pick up my teammate, Bieber. He struggled a little bit, but he kept them to only two runs,” Mazza said. “I just wanted to come in and keep them where they were at, basically limit the inning and pound the zone.”</p>\n<p>With a new pitcher for Fullerton on the mound in the ninth, junior outfielder Cameron Newell singled up the middle on the first pitch of the inning to put a runner on first base. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runner, the nation’s leading hitter, Epperson, connected on a fastball for his second walk-off hit against a ranked opponent in his career.</p>\n<p>“I thought they were just going to put me on, but when they didn’t, I figured they were pitching around me,” Epperson said. “I was trusting that Newell’s got good legs out there, and I was just trying to put a good swing on a ball, and not do too much.”</p>\n<p>Game one foreshadowed the closeness of the two teams. What was thought to be a low-scoring game turned out to be anything but as each team knocked around each side’s best pitcher early on.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ pitcher Thomas Eshelman came in with a 1.43 ERA and 5-1 record, but the Gauchos roughed him up for six earned runs, the most given up in his career. UCSB’s ace, junior Austin Pettibone did not fare better, lasting just three innings before exiting.</p>\n<p>The game was tied 9-9 in the tenth before darkness forced the match to be rescheduled before the start of game two. CSUF came out on top when play resumed by sneaking in two runs in the 11th inning for the hard fought 11-9 win.</p>\n<p>“You end in a tie to be resumed the next day and there’s a little bit of a letdown,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately they put a couple good swings together in that first half and we went down 2-0 right away.

Bieber tossed eight innings of four-hit ball and struck out eight batters to limit the Dirtbags to just one run.</p>\n<p>“That was the best I’ve ever seen [Bieber],” junior pitcher Austin Pettibone said. “He was kind of in the zone with his fastball. His slider was pretty filthy. That’s all you want to do — to be able to get deep into the game.”</p>\n<p>His outing set the stage for sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate to collect his ninth save of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game’s deadlock on a RBI groundout by sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic in the third inning to go up 1-0. Santa Barbara manufactured another run in the following inning on a fly out, after a sacrifice bunt advanced a runner to third base.</p>\n<p>Much of the game from there on consisted of each team’s pitching retiring the others’ bats. Bieber’s lone blemish came in the fifth inning when he allowed a runner to score on a fielder’s choice.</p>\n<p>Bieber was near perfect on the day, needing only 93 pitches for the win and lowering his ERA to 2.89.</p>\n<p>Bieber’s outing came the day before when Long Beach’s senior pitcher Josh Frye shutout the Gauchos in a tight 1-0 decision. Frye canceled out Pettibone’s own impressive efforts. The two starters were locked in a pitcher’s duel with Pettibone exiting after six innings with one run allowed.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach capitalized on two hits in the first inning to score the game’s only run, Pettibone seemed in for a long outing similar to his last start, but the right-hander settled down from there on.</p>\n<p>“It felt good to throw well again; I’ve been struggling these past couple weeks against Cal Poly and Fullerton,” Pettibone said. “I gave up an earned run which ended up hurting us, but overall I had a competitive outing.”</p>\n<p>Frye went the distance to improve to 3-0 on the season. Long Beach has now won Frye’s last four starts as the senior has given up only one run in his last 27 innings thrown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s only threat came by way of junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who was the only Gaucho to get past first base.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s five-run game was the highest scoring game of the series. Mounting a two-run rally in the ninth, the Gauchos’ comeback attempt fell short in the bottom half of the inning on a walk-off hit by the Dirtbags.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s sophomore pitcher Andrew Rohrbach kept hitters guessing for eight innings and did not rattle until the ninth. Kuresa doubled to force a change, and junior Kyle Friedrichs came in for the save.</p>\n<p>Friedrichs, however, gave up a walk and was victim to an infield error that brought in the runner from second. Freshman DH Billy Fredrick then stepped up to the plate and delivered the game-tying hit to nod the score at 2-2 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Long Beach got the bottom half of the inning started with a single off junior Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has been a workhorse and reliable relief pitcher for the Gauchos, retired the next batter before giving up the game-winning double for the 3-2 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UCR beginning Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of </em><em>April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/","id":4713,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4712,4711,4710],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 Gauchos Enter Must-Win Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UC Riverside in second to last home series.

Climbing their way to almost .500, the Highlanders are 17-19 overall and 6-3 in league after sweeping UC Davis in their last conference series. Riverside sits alone in third place, two games out of the second spot.</p>\n<p>With just two conference road wins under its belt, Santa Barbara welcomes a return to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium where it is 15-4 this year. Meanwhile, the road has been a headache for UCR. Riverside is 4-12 outside of home and has lost eight of its last nine away games. UCSB will have to take advantage of the home field given this is the second to last conference home series on the year.</p>\n<p>Senior Jake Smigelski will take the mound in game one for the Highlanders. In his last start against UC Davis, Smigelski threw 100 pitches in five laboring innings of work to improve to 5-4 on the season. For UCSB, sophomore Justin Jacome will be called on to contain the UCR offense that ranks third in hitting.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone is slated to take the mound for the Gauchos in game two, followed by freshman Shane Bieber in game three. Bieber is coming off his best start of the season last weekend when he tossed eight innings and gave up just one run en route to striking out eight batters.</p>\n<p>After leading the nation in hitting last week, senior third baseman Joey Epperson now finds himself in an unexpected hitting slump. Epperson has gone 1-12 in the past three games to lower his batting average to .418, a drop from his previous clip of .441. Nevertheless, the senior still leads the Big West in batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>Epperson and junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa have provided the one-two punch on offense for the Gauchos. Kuresa leads the team with 33 RBIs, and his .574 slugging percentage and eight homeruns are second-best in league. He was one of the few productive bats in the lineup last weekend as he hit .400 in the series.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sophomore Dillon Tate has served as the shutdown closer this year with nine saves.</p>\n<p>Tate has been lights-out in his 21.2 innings of work. He has given up just one earned run on the season and has struck out 28 batters, well above one strikeout per inning.
