The talented Seattle Seahawks cornerback has emerged as one of the most popular yet polarizing figures in the game of football thanks in large part to his postgame rant after the NFC Championship game. In case you need a refresher, Sherman yelled on camera, criticizing 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree and proclaiming himself the best cornerback in the game. Within minutes, Sherman was trending on Twitter, and he immediately became a national sensation.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have received much criticism, both online and in the media, and rightfully so. His behavior showed poor sportsmanship and took away from what truly should have mattered — his teammates and the team victory. Instead, Sherman took the spotlight to belittle an opposing player who he had just trumped on national television, causing media and fans across the nation to focus more so on his antics rather than the Seahawks advancing to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>But the way in which many have responded to Sherman is troubling and brings up an interesting and disturbing discussion. Many people, particularly online, resorted to calling Sherman a “thug,” a word with an extremely negative connotation. Is Sherman a loudmouth? Sure. Can he be described as cocky and at times arrogant? I wouldn’t argue against it. However, calling Sherman a thug and making him a villain out of a mishandled interview is certainly now way to him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sherman came from the poor neighborhood of Compton, worked hard in high school to graduate as the Salutatorian with a 4.2 GPA and received a scholarship to play football at Stanford. Once at Stanford, Sherman continued to excel, graduating with a 3.9 GPA and a degree in Communication while balancing football and a spot in the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He is also working towards a Master’s degree from Stanford.</p>\n<p>In addition to his academic excellence, Sherman is a generous and philanthropic man, often visiting underprivileged schools and providing students and athletes with the necessary resources that are often taken for granted in the classroom and on the field. Sherman even went as far as signing a contract with students, stipulating that if they were good students and members of the community, he would continue to provide them with classroom materials.</p>\n<p>A Stanford-educated man who has no criminal history and has shown a knack for helping children and the underprivileged certainly does not sound like a thug to me. Whether it is racism or even poor judgment and word choice on the behalf of critics, a thug is no way to describe Richard Sherman.</p>\n<p>His antics are over the top at times, but that, along with his talent on the field are what make him such a popular player. Sherman is the only defensive player in the top-10 of NFL jersey sales, and those numbers have skyrocketed in the past month.</p>\n<p>As far as his claim to be the best cornerback in the game — I’d have to agree with Sherman. The last two years he has been named All-Pro first team, registering eight interceptions in each season, a league high this year. In only three seasons of play, Sherman has registered 20 career interceptions. Not bad for a player who switched from wide receiver to cornerback in his final year at Stanford.</p>\n<p>A fifth round pick in the NFL draft by Seattle, Sherman has excelled in life every step of the way in the face of tremendous opposition. If you’ve ever heard him speak, aside from the notorious NFC Championship Game interview, you’d know Sherman is an intelligent and well-spoken man.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have certainly garnered him more haters, but with that come more and more fans as well. When examining Sherman for the man he is on and off the field, and not only judging him on the one instance of poor behavior, it is hard to justify the hate. I am surprised to admit to myself that I am a Richard Sherman fan, something I never thought I’d say.</p>\n<p>You can be sure he’ll be in the spotlight come Sunday and all eyes will be on him and his actions during and after the game. Sherman is no villain, just a fiery competitor. Best of luck to you, Richard, this Super Bowl Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/","id":3249,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3248,3247,3246],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Nothing But the Best Out West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Durant.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Durant.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grade Breakdown for the NBA's Western Conference","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The NBA is nearing the halfway point in its season and already there is plenty to talk about. Some teams have surprised us, like the Portland Trailblazers; other teams that looked promising have turned out to be massive failures, such as the two teams in New York. One of the biggest stories this season is the domination of the Western Conference over the East. Only four teams in the East are over .500 compared to eight in the West. With the exception of Indiana and Miami, there has been no competition when teams from the two sides have gone head-to-head. So, it’s time to take a look at the teams in the West. While the West has dominated over the East, there are some teams have overall have done really well and some that haven’t. At the halfway point, here’s a grade breakdown for each team in the more successful West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oklahoma City Thunder, A-</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>OKC is once again looking like a team that could contend for an NBA championship. Kevin Durant is making a strong case for MVP once again, leading the NBA in points with 29.2 points per game. He is also shooting 49.7 percent from the field and 42.2 percent from three point range. His partner in crime on offense, Russell Westbrook, was having one of his best NBA seasons until he suffered another injury, but he will be back this season. Westbrook was giving the Thunder a phenomenal 21.3 points and 7.0 assists per game. If he can return to full health, OKC will be playing late into the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Antonio Spurs, A</p>\n<p>The team that was seconds away from another NBA championship last season is at it again. The Big Three in San Antonio in Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili continue to get older and yet still continue to be great. They lead the Spurs offensively, averaging 14.2, 17.7 and 12.6 points, respectively. The success for the Spurs, however, still comes on the defensive end. San Antonio doesn’t allow opponents to find an offensive groove and continues to rank among the best in scoring defense. Most didn’t think San Antonio would compete with Miami last season, but this team of veterans doesn’t like to lose. They will always be around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portland Trailblazers, A+</p>\n<p>One of the biggest surprises in the NBA this season has been Portland. A team that was at one point topping the West, the Blazers are the top scoring team in the NBA, averaging 108.7 points per game. The scoring starts with LaMarcus Aldridge, who is averaging an incredible 23.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. Complementing Aldridge’s inside game is point guard Damian Lillard, who adds 21.3 points and 5.8 assists per game. Combined with Wesley Matthews on the perimeter, all-around player Nicolas Batum, and Robin Lopez, who is exceeding expectations, Portland finally has a team that is coming together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Clippers, B</p>\n<p>The Clippers are right where they’re supposed to be, atop the Pacific Division. While the defense needs to improve, Chris Paul continues to show why he’s the best point guard in the NBA, averaging 19.6 points and a league-leading 11.2 assists per game. However, Paul is now out for three to five weeks with a shoulder injury and without its glue, L.A. must show it can still win games. Blake Griffin, who is currently averaging a team-high 22 points per game, will be critical. L.A. has plenty of role players on this team, so if they can play well, the Clippers should be able to manage until Paul’s return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Rockets, B</p>\n<p>Houston has dealt with inconsistency this season, losing to bad teams like Utah and Sacramento. Yet, the Rockets could be a great team going further into the season. Of course, the Rockets should be winning games with two of the best players in the game. James Harden is having another fantastic year, having his way with opponents’ defense, averaging 24.4 points per game. In the middle, Dwight Howard has returned to more of the dominant center fans know. Howard is giving the Rockets 17.8 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. Along with Chandler Parsons and Jeremy Lin this is a team with plenty of firepower.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors, B+</p>\n<p>The Warriors aren’t atop the Western Conference right now, but they’re always dangerous and have won eight straight games. They’ve dealt with small injuries along the way to Stephan Curry and Andre Iguodala, but scoring will never be a problem on this team, which features the most dangerous backcourt in the game right now. Curry is averaging 23.3 points per game while Klay Thompson is tallying 19.3 points per contest. David Lee has stepped up too, giving the Warriors 18.9 points per game. Defensively, Golden State has Iguodala and Andrew Bogut to keep opponents in check, so if healthy, they could go far this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns, A</p>\n<p>Nobody thought Phoenix would be a playoff team. Most, including myself, thought the Suns would be a cellar dweller in the West. We were all wrong. Currently in the seventh seed, Phoenix is in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring, putting up 103.7 points per game. The reason for that can be found in Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Bledsoe, the understudy of Chris Paul last season, has spread his wings, averaging 18.0 points and 5.8 assists. Dragic is averaging slightly better numbers, tallying 18.8 points and 5.9 assists. The pair of guards has made Phoenix a playoff team and a huge surprise this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dallas Mavericks, B</p>\n<p>When your team has Dirk Nowitzki, you always have a good chance of making the playoffs. The veteran forward is not showing signs of age by any means, putting up 21.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He’s shooting 48.8 percent from the field, 40.8 percent from behind the arc and 92.0 percent from the free throw line. With Monta Ellis also making a big impact, averaging 20.2 points per game, there isn’t one player defenses can focus on. Defense might not be this team’s strength, but Nowitzki is a veteran player, making Dallas a team nobody can overlook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Timberwolves, B-</p>\n<p>Kevin Love has been a monster on the court this year. Averaging 26.4 points (second-best in the NBA) and 13.5 rebounds per game, Love has been consistent, putting numbers on the board night in and night out. Kevin Martin and Nikola Pekovic also keep the defense busy, tallying 19.8 and 18.0 points per game, respectively. So the offense is strong in Minnesota. The problem keeping the T-Wolves out of the playoff picture? Defense. The team gives up 102.9 points per game, fourth-highest in the NBA. Yet, the Timberwolves are currently just one spot out of the playoffs, so this is a team not to give up on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denver Nuggets, C+</p>\n<p>There’s one name to know in Denver: Ty Lawson. With Andre Iguodala gone, Lawson knows this is officially his team, and has put up the numbers to prove it, averaging 17.7 points and 8.1 assists per game. His teammates have matched his energy and the team has plenty of threats from behind the arc. Nevertheless, I don’t see this as a team that makes the playoffs. They simply don’t play good enough defense to be a top-eight contender.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New Orleans Pelicans, B-</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has stepped up big for New Orleans this season. The power forward continues to spread the opponents’ defense, shooting 40.9 percent from three-point range. Overall, he’s averaging an impressive 19.8 points per game. The problem for the Pelicans is that last week, Anderson went down with a neck injury and is still undergoing tests in Boston. The Pelicans do have Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, all of which are capable of putting up big numbers, but without Anderson, this team will struggle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Memphis Grizzlies, C-</p>\n<p>It seems like the Grizzlies have always been known for their defense. And they still are, holding opponents to 97.5 points per game. Defense will win a lot of ball games, but to win, you also have to be able to score points. Mike Conley has found his stride on the offensive end, giving the Grizzlies a solid 17.3 points per game. Zach Randolph has also done his job for Memphis this season, leading the team with 17.1 points per game. Yet, the Grizzlies are still on the bottom end of the NBA in scoring. This may change when Marc Gasol returns, but the Grizzlies need to find an answer now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Lakers, B+</p>\n<p>The Lakers have to be wondering how they could receive so much bad luck in one season. Many teams have suffered injuries, but none as many as L.A. First, superstar Kobe Bryant returned from his torn Achilles tendon. Six games later, he injured his knee and will be out for extended time. Steve Nash has also only played in six games. He is one of a handful of point guards the Lakers have gone through. L.A. has gone deep into its D-League team with the only recognizable name left on the Lakers being Pau Gasol. With so much uncertainty and so many roster changes, Head Coach Mike D’Antoni requires a lot of credit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sacramento Kings, D</p>\n<p>In a rebuilding year, star DeMarcus Cousins has proved himself a premier center in the NBA, averaging 23.2 points and 11.4 rebounds, but Cousins still has a lot of maturing to do as he currently leads the league in technicals. Isaiah Thomas has also stepped up, adding 19.3 points and 6.2 assists per contest. The recently acquired Rudy Gay has been great thus far, putting up 19.5 points per game. But offense isn’t the problem. Despite Head Coach Michael Malone preaching defense, Sacramento still gives up 104.5 points to its opponent, second-worst in the NBA. The formula for improvement is pretty simple: play defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Utah Jazz, D+</p>\n<p>Compared to most NBA teams, Utah doesn’t have much talent, lacking a huge NBA star. Therefore, the team wasn’t expected to win big. Nevertheless, with the worst record in the West, it’s not possible to give this team a passing grade. In what was supposed to be a developmental year for the Jazz, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors have been decent for the Jazz, averaging 16.5 and 13.5 points per game, respectively, but the Jazz need more from Trey Burke. The highly-anticipated rookie that slipped to the ninth pick in the draft has struggled with consistency despite averaging 13.3 points and 5.2 assists. Right now, the Jazz would have a good shot in the lottery, which looks to have several franchise-changing players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/","id":3246,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[3245,3244,3243],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GRECIA-MARTINEZ-–-Peyton-Stotelmyre.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GRECIA-MARTINEZ-–-Peyton-Stotelmyre.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grecia Martinez overhauled many aspects of the OSA and made a lasting effect on the office, despite a lack of transparency at times in her term.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The </em>Nexus<em> has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

She said the physical space within Associated Students (A.S.) Main in the Multi-Cultural Center was in poor condition and lacked the supplies needed to do casework effectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming in and realizing all of these things … the person who assumes this position has to really care about students and want to do it,” Martinez said in an interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of immediately beginning the projects she planned for her term, Martinez said she first “had to take a huge step back” and “really pick apart the foundations” in order to improve the general functioning of the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I settled into the position in the summer, that’s when I realized that this office needed to be number one, the foundation needed to be fixed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fundamental part of this was rewriting A.S. Legal Code for the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) in order to better reflect the needs of students. Martinez said she changed the former divisions of casework within the office from Academic, Housing, Code of Conduct and Public Interest to consolidate some categories and create new divisions, which are now Grievances, Conduct and Academic and Financial Aid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this new organization of divisions fostered a more streamlined approach to case handling, in addition to making the process more intuitive for students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewriting Legal Code also included taking out the polling analyst project that was added the year before by Tannenbaum. Martinez said that the project’s execution did not reflect the initial vision or the needs of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In terms of the execution and the survey questions and everything, there wasn’t really anything there,” Martinez said. “Those questions that they had spent the whole year working on, I didn’t see how they would it would directly benefit this office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her term, Martinez also began a project to create a database of past cases that were previously filed physically. Now, the office files all cases online, and the next S.A.G. will be able to use that database to observe patterns in the data of the cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped to create a new logo for the OSA, which she said would help with outreach and better reflect the services of the office. She also noted that her office was more active on social media compared to her predecessor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Martinez did not have updated office hours for Spring Quarter 2019 available on the website, which she said was due to ongoing construction of the website. Office hours for Spring Quarter were also not readily available on the S.A.G.’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez collaborated with other UC campuses’ OSAs throughout the year to inform some of her projects for her term as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot of close communication to the other campuses and seeing how their student advocate offices work and what works well for them and what doesn’t.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, conversations with UC San Diego inspired Martinez to create an online appointment system for the office, similar to the one she had seen at their campus. The project is still in progress, but Martinez said she hopes it will make the office more accessible and user-friendly to students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped lift a project off the ground that had been floating in the office for some time: moving OSA office to the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. The idea was something Robin Unander, the attorney for A.S., introduced to Martinez, and now something that Martinez hopes to pass on to the new S.A.G.-elect, Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move aims to provide a more secure and confidential place for students to air their grievances, cases or concerns with OSA staff. Martinez’s case workers began holding office hours in the Pardall Center beginning in Spring Quarter 2019. The case workers from OSA literally worked alongside Undocumented Student Services and other legal services to create a more centralized space for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this quarter has focused on the logistics of moving the office, but she hopes that the OSA will be operating its services from the Pardall Center and the current space in A.S. Main will be used for administrative tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said a goal of hers for this year was to advocate for historically underrepresented and silenced students on campus. One way she addressed this was through her hiring decisions within the office. Martinez said she intentionally hired staff that came from different communities, clubs and cultural groups in order to better reach those people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, Martinez said the staff in OSA created a more welcoming place for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who I hired in the office are definitely a lot more understanding of the students who come in and they know how to talk to them better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her own background, as well as her work in various roles on campus, including as an A.S. senator in the 2017-2018 school year, helped her better understand students alongside her caseworkers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just know what it feels like to need help and not know where to go,” Martinez said. “Because of our background and experiences, I feel like a lot of people are more willing to go to great lengths to make sure that student is helped, that a student gets what they need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this aspect of her office is an improvement over Tannenbaum’s, citing that her office was more efficient in completing casework. Martinez said her office completed around 60 cases over the course of the year, but she noted that a lot of helping students involved giving guidance, talking things over and resolving problems that didn’t necessitate an officially documented case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez initiated significant projects during her term and followed through with a handful of the platform promises she made during her campaign. She had hoped to collaborate more with other groups on campus to specifically address student needs, but she said the conditions of the office that she inherited required more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Martinez at times failed to be completely transparent with the student body. Martinez <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\">withdrew from classes during Fall Quarter 2018</a>, but never came forward about withdrawing until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported the withdrawal in Winter Quarter 2019. Concerns about Martinez’s eligibility for the position erupted soon after, but ultimately, A.S.

The <em>Daily Nexus</em> Editorial Board wrote that Ho “fails to show professionalism” during Senate meetings, seemingly forgetting that  ”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.”</span></p>\n<p>While Ho has maintained a more professional decorum at more serious Senate meetings, such as last month’s divestment meeting, in some ways, he has continued to act unprofessionally throughout his term.</p>\n<p>Ho has been involved with A.S. for all three of his years at UC Santa Barbara, beginning as a fellow in the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office during the 2016-2017 school year before being elected as an on-campus senator for the 2017-2018 year.</p>\n<p>Two main platforms Ho emphasized during his term were expanding the A.S. Fellowship and making A.S. more visible to undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“I think I was able to fulfill both, [but] not to the extent that I really hoped to do so,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho cited deputy chief of staff resignations in both A.S. President Brooke Kopel’s office and his own, beginning the year in a scramble.</p>\n<p>“Because of academic reasons, the deputy chief of staff I had the vision with had to resign before the actual year started. So I had to try really quickly to hire a new one … so basically our hopes for it were not intermingling with the new people that were appointed,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho said he took a more “proactive” role in attending meetings for various advisory boards that he said the IVP does not usually attend, including the UCEN Governance Board, A.S. Finance and Business Committee, Elections Committee and Student Fee Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, the IVP is required to attend meetings for the above listed committees, as well as the Calendar Committee, A.S. Commission on Public Safety, Transportation Alternatives Board, Parking Ratepayers Board and Tech and Media Services Committee, which Ho said he did not attend.</p>\n<p>Ho said he was “never contacted by the Calendar Committee,” “[didn’t] think [A.S. Commission on Public Safety] even had a chair this year,” didn’t know if Transportation Alternatives Board and Parking Ratepayers Board even existed and said the Tech and Media Services committee was “not existent this year.”</p>\n<p>Other responsibilities of the IVP, according to A.S. Legal Code, include ensuring honoraria is given to senators on time, ensuring a parliamentarian is hired for Senate proceedings and planning senator trainings during Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>While honoraria was issued on time during Fall Quarter 2018, the Honoraria Committee had problems meeting quorum, resulting in a late dispersal of honoraria during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>After the A.S. Parliamentarian, Morales, resigned earlier this year, Ho could not find a replacement after multiple attempts.</p>\n<p>Ho did plan required trainings for senators on topics including anti-Semitism and sexual violence, but A.S. Legal Code states these trainings must be completed by week six of Fall Quarter 2018; Ho delayed them to the first week of Winter Quarter 2019, citing attendance issues.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to invite an external organization to come talk to less than half the Senate. I didn’t want to waste their time, I didn’t want to waste our time. So the first week of winter quarter seemed the most practical, because we got higher attendance when that happened,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Through his work with certain committees, Ho worked alongside Finance and Business Chair Zion Solomon to extend more funding to various Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs).</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he and Solomon did an “excellent job” at reaching out to campus organizations to get funding through A.S.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why we ran out of money so quickly in the year; it was really hard when you have to turn down some groups that wanted funding.”</p>\n<p>“Traditionally A.S. runs out of money week five, week six of Spring Quarter, this year it was around week three, week four that we ran out of money,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“Other than allocating more money towards our OSL fund, and encouraging groups to go to BCUs for their funding sources [or] adjusting the A.S. Budget or maybe proposing a lock-in on top of what we already have for Finance and Business, there’s no other thing we can do.”</p>\n<p>Another goal Ho campaigned on as IVP was to make all Senate resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible on the A.S. website, but failed to do so due to an “outdated system.”<br>\n“The thing about editing the website, it’s super difficult because we run on an outdated system at Associated Students,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“A lot of communication disparity happened within that and I just never got that finished.”</p>\n<p>Ho’s leadership style centered on fostering a collaborative environment for senators divided along party lines, and “[controlling] the room when it needed to be controlled.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously party politics played a huge role in this year’s Senate, even a bigger role than I’ve ever seen in my years in A.S.,” Ho said. “So [I kept] that atmosphere loose when I need to foster a collaborative environment, but if it did get hostile… [I would make] sure people aren’t out of order.”</p>\n<p>“If you met those senators, they definitely do not like each other. So making sure that if there’s a chance they can collaborate with one another, and be loose and be friends, I have taken it this year.”</p>\n<p>Ho did not run for any A.S. position for the 2019-20 year, but instead hopes to “get more involved with my own communities I identify with.”</p>\n<p>Alli Adam, a third-year political science major currently serving as a Letters and Science senator, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/live-a-s-election-results-2019/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1557993045384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHk38ViiWD4JQuHfJNuFIEP6ua-w\">succeed</a> Ho for the 2019-20 school year</span>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
