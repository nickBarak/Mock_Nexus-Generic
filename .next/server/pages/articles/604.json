\r\n</script> \n<p>In addition, after losing its entire starting frontline to graduation, Santa Barbara will feature a much smaller lineup this year, with only two forwards and one center on the roster.</p>\n<p>If any players will look familiar, it will be the guards as UCSB’s trio of seniors will be the leaders of this year’s team.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be obvious with anyone we play we’re going to be undersized,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But we have an experienced group of guards and they’ve worked extremely hard and it’s their third year in our system.”</p>\n<p>With a new team comes a new style of play, especially on the offensive end. While the Gauchos finished last in the Big West in scoring offense last season at 51.3 points per game, a fast-paced, run-and-gun offense will complement the smaller lineup and the Gauchos will try to spread the floor with guards that can score in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>“I’ll make the adjustment that we’ll have to get up and down,” Mitchell said. “I think in the past, it was in our benefit to find ways to grind it out, but with this team we’re going to have to keep it pretty simple and spread people out because we have to take advantage of our strengths, which is quickness.”</p>\n<p>However, one thing that won’t change under Mitchell’s control is the focus on defense. The coach that has led Santa Barbara to the postseason in her first two years at UCSB will look to up the defensive intensity, implementing a high-pressure press.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Gauchos topped the conference and ranked 20th in the nation in points allowed per game at 52.9 and opponent field goal percentage at 36.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to press a lot more,” Mitchell said. “I think it’ll be to our benefit to speed people up and get easy baskets. Hopefully, we’ll get teams into some shot clock issues with our [press]. Now, we can get more aggressive on the ball and in the passing lanes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was picked to finish fifth in the Big West Preseason Poll behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“I think we have the chance to be a very good team and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later,” Mitchell said. “Northridge tended to play that same style: quick, small and athletic. That’s probably going to be more of our personality this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Guards</p>\n<p>#1 Kristine Brance (junior)</p>\n<p>Brance may be new to UCSB, but she’s not lacking any experience. The Latvia native transfers to Santa Barbara after playing two years at the nationally ranked Chipola College in Florida, where she led her team in scoring, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field and an incredible 36 percent from three point range. Bringing toughness from her experience, knowledge of how to win, as well as the European style to UCSB, Brance will be critical in providing an offensive spark, especially from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>#2 Jasmine Ware (sophomore)</p>\n<p>In her first season at UCSB, Ware showed her potential to fit into Mitchell’s system, proving to be an effective defensive stopper. In her 11.4 minutes per game last year, she averaged 0.5 steals per contest. This year, as a taller guard at 5’10’’, Ware could help the Gauchos offensively too, as she has a smooth shot from 15 to 17 feet. Mitchell even described her midrange game as “second to none on this team.” Plus, needing to play small and push the ball should play right into Ware’s strengths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#3 Nicole Nesbit (senior)</p>\n<p>One of the three key seniors this season, Nesbit is a two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection. As the floor general last season, she ranked third in minutes at 29.5 per game, second in points per game at 10.5, second in steals per game at 0.8 and led the team in assists per game at 2.8. This season, Nesbit will move over to the shooting guard where she can use her scoring instinct and speed to either get to the basket or rise up for the jumper off the dribble. And the more she can get to the rim, the better because last season she led the team in free throw percentage at an impressive 87.5 percent. According to Mitchell, “we haven’t seen Nic’s best game yet.” She is certainly capable of averaging double digits every night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#10 Onome Jemerigbe (freshman)</p>\n<p>The player allowing Nesbit to slide over to the shooting guard is Jemerigbe. Coming from a great high school team in St. Mary’s High, Mitchell compared her young point guard to Shannon Bobbitt from Tennessee. Giving the Gauchos a different type of point guard, Jemerigbe has a pass first mentality. Lightning quick, she has the lateral foot speed that UCSB has lacked the last few years, which will allow Santa Barbara to hound the opponent’s ball handler and help in transition defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#22 Melissa Zornig (senior)</p>\n<p>The second of the trio of seniors, Zornig is another offensive threat for UCSB. She has the ability to score in a variety of ways, averaging 8.0 points per game and 81 percent shooting from the charity stripe last season. However, Zornig can certainly average double-figures this year, as shown by her career-high 24 points against UC Davis last season. Next to Brance, Zornig will form a duo of three-point threats as she led the team in three-point percentage last year at 32.5 percent. She also averaged 2.2 assists last year and led the team in assist to turnover ratio, exemplifying her high basketball I.Q. As the “most consistent player right now” according to Mitchell, Zornig will be a big part of the team and a leader for Santa Barbara this upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#33 Destini Mason (senior)</p>\n<p>Rounding out the trio of seniors is Mason, who is known as the athletic defensive stopper for the Gauchos. Described by Mitchell as even “light-years better than last year,” Mason has stepped up as the vocal leader for UCSB. Ranking second on the team in three-point percentage last year at 28.0 percent and third on the team in rebounding, but the top rebounding guard, at 3.8 per game, Mason is an exceptionally versatile player. Like Angelei Aguirre from last season, Mason will be asked to play a lot of minutes in lots of positions, anywhere from one through four.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forwards</p>\n<p>#13 Kendra Morrison (sophomore)</p>\n<p>Morrison only played 5.8 minutes per game last year, but when she did find time on the court, she took advantage, shooting 43.8 percent from the field. Showing what she could do last year against USC where she totaled 11 points on 5-5 shooting, Morrison should expect more minutes this season with the lack of depth at the forward position. With a high basketball I.Q. and the ability to open up the offense because she is a stronger body who can also knock down the three, it could be a breakout season for Morrison.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#34 Mi’Chael Wright (freshman)</p>\n<p>In high school, Wright averaged 12.7 points and 9.4 rebounds. Now here at UCSB, Wright is a blue-collar player with a knack for rebounding, which will be critical for the Gauchos because if they’re going to play a faster style, they have to be able to rebound. Described by Mitchell to be like Charles Barkley or a more offensively- minded Aguirre from last season, Wright has the ability to put up 10-12 points a night simply on hustle and her notable basketball I.Q.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Center</p>\n<p>#12 Melissa Maragnes (freshman)</p>\n<p>At 6’2’’, Maragnes will be the tallest player on the UCSB roster this season and be responsible for guarding the opponent’s center. At St. Monica High School, she averaged 9.9 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, setting the school’s block record at 60.

Signing after the Gauchos’ tournament run was junior guard Akilah Jennings, who transferred to UCSB after one year at Northern Colorado and one season at Foothill College.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules after her departure from Seattle University, will be making her Gaucho debut this year.<br>\nUpon entering Saturday’s matchup, UCSB was tabbed to finish third in the Big West standings in both of the conference’s preseason coaches’ and media polls.</p>\n<p>Presuming that its starters will play for only the first quarter at most, Santa Barbara’s exhibition will serve as more of an experimentation period with its lineup considering some players will be sidelined.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting and a good opportunity for us to play somebody else. The third chapter might start with a bunch of Band-Aids on it because we’re a little dinged up, but at least it’s November,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re going to hold Drew [Edelman] out because she’s got a right thumb that’s been sore. We’ve got a couple more bodies in that we didn’t have a week ago so we’re still a work in progress. For those that have been out and are coming back in, [the most important thing] is for them to get some reps and be in practice every day as their growth continues.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, other Gauchos who have experienced offseason injuries and are gradually making their way back include sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez, Bates and Quintino.</p>\n<p>While exhibition games typically result in a Division I program facing some lower-tiered Division II, III or even less reputable schools, the Gauchos are going against one of their best preseason opponents of the Henrickson era on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Cal State East Bay enters the 2017-18 season with momentum following a 22-9, 16-4 CCAA record with the guidance of then first-year Head Coach Shanele Stires. Within the past two years, the Pioneers have made back-to-back Division II NCAA tournament appearances after capturing consecutive CCAA women’s basketball tournament titles.</p>\n<p>East Bay won 11 of its last 12 regular season games going into the CCAA tournament, where it won three straight games to win the title before losing to Western Washington in the first round of the DII NCAA West Regional.</p>\n<p>How CSU East Bay will do on the offensive end is most intriguing following the loss of former guard Shomari Harris, who led both the CCAA and Pioneers in scoring with 17 points per game (PPG). Another senior that will be missed is former center Remy Puou, who was the team’s second leading scorer with 10.2 PPG.</p>\n<p>Despite its DII status, East Bay presents a challenge that could possibly deliver an exhibition game that possesses a regular season feel, which is competition the Gauchos are ready to embrace.</p>\n<p>“When you’re scheduling [games dating back] a year ago, considering our anticipation of returning to the Big West tournament, it’s the right thing to do [to challenge ourselves],” Henrickson said. “We’re going to play against some players that we haven’t seen in their system. We’re trying to dig up some film on what they looked like last year. There’s going to be some things that we’re going to see that we’re not going to be able to anticipate. But then that’s where the use of timeouts and communicating in huddles help to make some adjustments on the fly.”</p>\n<p>With very little weighing on the outcome of Saturday’s exhibition, not much pressure is on UCSB, who won’t be at full health when they compete. With just one preseason game before its regular season tip-off, the Gauchos still have a chance to set a precedent as to what they hope to become this year.</p>\n<p>The exhibition between UCSB and CSUEB will take place in the Thunderdome at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/","id":601,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[600,599,598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Preview: Pacific Division","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Kings.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Kings.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"NBA Pacific Conference Preview","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The NBA season is now underway with preseason games already started.

It should be an exciting race, basketball fans.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sacramento Kings</p>\n<p>At the top of the Sacramento Kings website is the saying “1985-Forever”. After uncertainty as to the Kings’ future in Sacramento, the team is staying for the long run with new ownership, marking a new era in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings aren’t a team that will be in contention for an NBA championship this season, but as a rebuilding year, Sacramento will be looking for growth and improvement, and lots of it. The team has compiled some solid pieces that should at the very least make the Kings competitive on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“We really have the pieces in place to be a special team,” point guard Isaiah Thomas said. “The goal is to make the playoffs. If everything comes together, if we play consistently and give it all we got, I think we can compete for one of those spots in the Western Conference.”</p>\n<p>Anchoring the franchise is center DeMarcus Cousins. The third-year player was just given a four-year, $62 million contract extension, showing the Kings’ faith that Cousins is their franchise player. Sacramento needs Cousins to step up as the team’s leader and be a consistent, dominant big man. Last season, Cousins averaged 17.1 points and 9.9 rebounds, but struggled with maturity. If Cousins can step up, he could change the path of the Kings in a very positive way.</p>\n<p>General Manager Pete D’Alessandro’s biggest offseason move was shipping off Tyreke Evans, which is a perfect symbol of the changing culture in Sacramento. No longer will the Kings be a selfish team, but will focus instead on selflessness and defense.</p>\n<p>Even without Evans, the Kings are deep at point guard. Competing for the starting role are Greivis Vasquez and Thomas. Vasquez is a pass-first point guard, ranking third in the NBA last season in assists at 9.0 per game. Thomas, on the other hand, is a quick fire cracker who, at just 5’9’’, can get underneath the defense. The opposing styles of the two should bode well for the Kings, giving the team plenty of choice for different situations.</p>\n<p>“Greivis is not the quickest of guards, but he’s big in size and can post up and use his body. Also, he can look over the defense and distribute the ball,” forward Jason Thompson said. “And Isaiah obviously isn’t the tallest guy there but has a huge heart and brings a lot of energy. He can really shoot the three-ball too.”</p>\n<p>Starting at the shooting guard position will be Marcus Thornton, a natural scorer. Also available is rookie Ben McLemore, a terrific shooter from Kansas. Malone also has a few options at the small forward shot with veteran John Salmons and Luc Mbah a Moute. Both are great defenders,and Salmons brings veteran leadership, entering his 12th NBA season.</p>\n<p>“John is a talented player. He’s been around the league a long time and he’s a versatile guy,” Malone said. “And bringing a guy like [Luc] into our culture is a huge bonus because of all the things he stands for: professionalism, hard work, defense and high character.”</p>\n<p>Possibly the deepest position for Sacramento is the power forward spot, with Thompson, Carl Landry and Patrick Patterson all viable options for the Kings. Thompson, the athletic, long big man, averaged 10.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know that there’s any other NBA team that has the depth that we have at the power forward,” Malone said. “They all bring something different to the table, but those are three players that deserve to be on the floor.”</p>\n<p>While Sacramento didn’t sign a marquee player to send them to be a shoe-in for the playoffs, the improvement for the Kings is evident. With so much unknown as to how everything will come together, the Kings could make some noise and show a glimmer of hope that they might return to their glory days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA playoffs last season, it seemed L.A. had all the pieces to go far. But despite the incredible offensive firepower, the squad flopped when it mattered, falling to Memphis in the first round.</p>\n<p>Five months later, the Clippers still have a roster full of talent, keeping all core players intact. A different style though, will be on display as L.A. brought in a new head coach, Doc Rivers. Rivers will bring a more fluid, balanced offense to the Clippers as well as an emphasis on defense.</p>\n<p>Therefore, “lob city” is no more in L.A., but that shouldn’t matter. This should be a fun team to watch with two of the most exciting players in the league. Point guard Chris Paul is the first, averaging 16.9 points and 9.7 assists last season, second best in the league.</p>\n<p>Power forward Blake Griffin can fly high, throwing down monstrous dunks. Last season, he averaged 18 points and 8.3 rebounds as the go-to player for the Clippers. Playing next to Griffin is Jordan, the Clippers defensive presence with 1.4 blocks per game last season.</p>\n<p>The additions of J.J. Reddick and Darren Collison to solidify the shooting guard spot along with role players Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford, the Clippers have compiled a roster that’s ready to win games.</p>\n<p>Last year, the LA team in red, white and blue won its first division title and earned 50 wins for the first time in its 44-year history. This year, the Clippers absolutely have the pieces to outright win it again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>\n<p>One thing will determine the Los Angeles Lakers’ success this year: injuries. The team is full of aging veterans, who together could be great, but have to remain on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Lakers lost many key players in the offseason, including Dwight Howard, Metta World Peace and Earl Clark, leaving plenty of pressure on three big players for L.A.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant, one of best players in the game, is still out after rupturing his Achilles tendon at the end of last season. He’s not expected for the season opener, but when he returns, he’ll be back to prove himself after people questioned whether the injury would end his career. Last season, the “Black Mamba” averaged 27.3 points per game on 57 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>The Lakers will always be dangerous with Bryant on the floor, but he is showing the very beginning signs of slowing down and needs to make sure he doesn’t come back too soon.</p>\n<p>Point guard Steve Nash only played in 50 games last year., but at 39, still has the ability to be great, averaging 12.7 points and 6.7 assists last season.</p>\n<p>And then there’s forward Pau Gasol, who is probably thrilled Howard is gone. The two didn’t mix well, and Gasol will finally own that big man role. As a result, the Lakers should expect an increase from his 13.7 points per game last year.</p>\n<p>One problem for the Lakers this season will be depth. They brought in Jordan Farmar and Chris Kaman, but their bench isn’t nearly as strong as it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Lakers could make the playoffs, but everything will have to go right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors</p>\n<p>The darlings of last year’s NBA playoffs return even stronger this year.</p>\n<p>To start, the team picked up veteran Andre Iguodala, an athletic small forward who can bring it on the defensive end as well as score, averaging 1.7 steals and 13.0 points per game last season. He adds a defensive presence to a team that is typically very offensive-minded.</p>\n<p>Of course, the most important player on the roster is Stephen Curry, who averaged 22.9 points and 6.9 assists last season. He shot just over 45 percent from behind the arc, setting an NBA record of 272 made threes.</p>\n<p>Combined with Klay Thompson, the duo scored 483 threes, more than any other twosome in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The focus on the three-point shot leaves plenty of space inside for both Andrew Bogut and David Lee. Lee averaged 18.5 points per game, second on the team last season, as well as 11.2 rebounds. Along with Iguodala, they should be able to go inside or out.</p>\n<p>What kept the Warriors from moving deeper in the playoffs last year was their inability to finish games. Now, the team has another year of experience under their belt and has added a few veterans, leaving the team extremely dangerous down the stretch of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns</p>\n<p>Every division needs its cellar dweller. In the Pacific Division, Phoenix is that team.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Suns finished at the bottom of Western conference at 25-57. Although the team hired a new head coach in NBA legend Jeff Hornacek, the team is still without any stars for him to work with.</p>\n<p>The team acquired guards Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green, but lost Michael Beasley and second-leading scorer Luis Scola.</p>\n<p>The team will rely on point guard Goran Dragic to lead the team, which he did last year with 14.7 points and 7.4 assists per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of Oct. 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We’re [still] going to bank on our returners, and we have certainly relied on them and will continue to rely on them to get the young people … more comfortable every day as far as how we play and the style of play,” Hendrickson said. “Will we rely on our returners? Yes. Will the young players in our program get opportunities? Absolutely.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79606\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1381518073\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79608\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79606\" data-attachment-id=\"79606\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/m-and-w-bball-opener/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"m and w bball opener\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79606\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener-683x1024.png?resize=800%2C1200\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/m-and-w-bball-opener.png?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Following Saturday’s exhibition win, Henrickson admitted she might have been worried starting three freshmen in years past, but her high praise for her newcomers grants the Gauchos some flexibility.</p>\n<p>With senior Drew Edelman and sophomore Natalia Bruening sitting out due to minor injuries, Santa Barbara seems to have the luxury of not rushing their returns.</p>\n<p>Edelman, who played for Team USA over the summer for the Maccabi Games in Israel, is looking to bring that experience back to UCSB in a positive way for the Gauchos when she returns to action for the season opener.</p>\n<p>The 6’4” redshirt senior not only played in the Maccabi Games, but she also was a key component in the U.S. winning gold at the event, recording a dominant 29 points and 19 boards in the championship game over Israel.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Edelman will be a big part of Santa Barbara’s season this year if she can manage to put up even half those numbers consistently.</p>\n<p>“[Edelman]’s just in better shape and stronger than she was last year,” Henrickson explained, “and now she’s as strong as she’s been in the last couple years.”</p>\n<p>After proving that they can effectively utilize a small-ball lineup, the Gauchos only become more threatening with the anticipated return of Edelman and Bruening.</p>\n<p>Bruening, also 6’4”, plays center and will free up Akilah Jennings of her duties at the five, allowing Santa Barbara more length and versatility on the perimeter when she returns.</p>\n<p>However, for Henrickson, Sahar has definitely been one of the key players to watch.</p>\n<p>Before transferring to UCSB, Sahar spent a season at Seattle University, where she averaged a slash line of 10.2/3.9/1.7 while even dropping a career-high 23 points against Big West foe UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>At Seattle, the Tarzana native’s deadliest weapon was her three-point game.<br>\nIn her freshman season, she was the team’s best, averaging 38.2 percent from beyond the arc and nailing 68 threes, 23 more than the second most on the team.</p>\n<p>“She can shoot the three, and she’s at the right place for that because we can get her uncontested shots. She gives us added weapons from the three-point line,” Henrickson said. “Tal’s big enough, long enough to play a four and defend a four, so it gives us some size on the glass, too. And that’s what we need our big wings to do; they’ve got to rebound the ball better.”</p>\n<p>The Coach Bonnie era is in full swing for Santa Barbara; however, for Northern Arizona, their new era has just begun, starting with the signing of a new head coach, Loree Payne.</p>\n<p>Payne previously led a successful seven-year coaching campaign at Puget Sound that saw her winning just under 70 percent of games in both conference and regular-season play.</p>\n<p>The Lumberjacks under Payne are looking to move in a new direction, having 10 newcomers to the team. The rebuilding effort of Northern Arizona will be a process, as the Lumberjacks finished with just six wins last season.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup will feature plenty of newcomers from both teams, as well as ambitious coaches in Henrickson and Payne looking to guide their programs to an opening win.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on NAU on Friday, Nov. 10, with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79608\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79608\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/womens-basketball-opens-season-on-the-road-versus-northern-arizona/","id":603,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[602,601,600],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
