id=\"caption-attachment-82096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SB 461 will provide up to nine units of financial aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In its current iteration, Senate Bill 461 (SB 461) will provide up to nine units of aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant, and would be valid for four-year students for two summer sessions, and valid to transfer students for one summer session.</p>\n<p>Generally, summer sessions are six weeks long, shorter than the standard 10 week quarter.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple changes this year, but it doesn’t have to do with the bill, it has to do with the climate,” Kuvimbinashe “Eddy” Chikukwa, chair for Coalition for a Better UC, said.</p>\n<p>He cited the election of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a reason for why the bill may pass this time.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom is] more favorable towards funding higher education… and really willing to reform the Cal Grant system in a way that we did not see last year.”</p>\n<p>Newsom, who previously sat on the UC Board of Regents, has been much more receptive to suggestions compared to former governor Jerry Brown, who had “a very antagonistic position with regards to the UC,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom] got to hear a lot of the complaints people had, and he got to hear a lot of the solutions people had regarding this issue… Gavin understands that you need to fund higher education so that students have adequate aid to get out faster.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the bill, students are pushing for a budget request to ensure that money is allocated specifically for summer aid.</p>\n<p>“Last year, a lot of people were hesitant to support it because if the bill were passed it would be drawn from the general fund, and there were concerns that this money could be taken from other students,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>SB 461 has drawn more support and grown a larger coalition of interest groups that are invested in reforming Cal Grant. The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is co-sponsoring the bill, while the CSU Chancellor’s Office and the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) are also in support of it.</p>\n<p>“There is also the will to reform Cal Grant. There is an actual desire which is evidenced by the recent assembly,” Chikukwa said, in reference to the joint legislative hearing chaired by California State Assembly Members José Medina and Kevin McCarty on Feb. 6, where “Closing the Degree Gap” was discussed.</p>\n<p>Regarding the necessity of summer aid for eligible students, Chikukwa noted the projected deficit of college graduates by 2030.</p>\n<p>“We’re acknowledging the fact that there’s a 1.1 million college graduate deficit that’s going to happen, we’re acknowledging the fact that low-income students tend to be the ones who don’t graduate on time, and we’re acknowledging the fact that we need more of these students to graduate faster.”</p>\n<p>Chikukwa also noted how S.T.E.M. students, who don’t necessarily always pass their major classes, often must resort to taking summer classes.</p>\n<p>Another issue which arises is that major classes during the year are often overenrolled.</p>\n<p>“So the state is making us enroll all these students into these courses and we don’t have space to put you in right now, so the best option is summer, and the state is making the UC do this and not providing summer aid, which is problematic,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>The bill has a long way to go, however.</p>\n<p>“We just introduced it, this is still the ‘hip hip hurrah’ phase.”</p>\n<p>In order to become law, SB 461 must make it through the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate floor. Then, after this, it must go through the California State Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, Chikukwa is optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It was really scrutinized heavily last year. A lot of people looked at it and they made their suggestions, and so this year I haven’t heard too many objections because the final objection last year was the lack of a budget request. People didn’t have any problems with the language of the bill.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday marks the fulfillment of some of Black Student Union’s (BSU) primary goals in its demands throughout the years: the creation of an Office of Black Student Development at UCSB and a space on campus dedicated to Black students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang sent a message to the BSU Demands Team yesterday, promising funding for BSU’s eight proposed positions within the office, $55,000 annually for BSU programs and that the university would “work toward the vision of a Center for Black Student Development over the next several years,” according to the message.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These proposals were part of the most recent <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\">set of demands</a> BSU released to the university in February, but built upon over 50 years of efforts from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For BSU President Mariyah Lewis and BSU Demands Team leader Samantha Sanchez, seeing the fulfillment of these demands warranted a moment for the two to pause from their efforts and celebrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cried for about two and a half hours,” Sanchez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commitment the university made to the Black student community by fulfilling these demands speaks to a greater awareness of Black students and their unique needs as a student community on campus, Lewis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a good feeling to say the least, to know the administration is pushing for us and striving for better support of Black students on campus,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said BSU’s demands represent a vital aspect of university’s commitments, which include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“creating a culture that affirms the intrinsic dignity in each of us, celebrating differences, and making UC Santa Barbara an inclusive environment in which to live, work, and learn,” he wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to Black student groups and community members, Sanchez acknowledged the strides made by UCSB administrators in its support of Black students, noting that these commitments are a symbol of courage as well as progress toward equity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes strong leadership and courage on the behalf of administration to understand and implement a structure to repair those deficits and restore the Black community’s faith in the education system. Today, our university administration displayed both this leadership and courage,” Sanchez wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Sanchez said the fruition of these demands will pave the way for “monumental initiatives across the UC system to create greater access to higher institutions of learning and overall achievement for Black people and people of color.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez said that the hiring process for positions in the Office of Black Student Development can start immediately. The positions will be developed within the Division of Student Affairs, and  hiring will be led by BSU members and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The positions within the office include a director, an assistant director, two academic support counselors, a recruitment and retention specialist, a coordinator of Black student life and two advocacy counselors.

After winning the Premier League in 2009, Ferguson was handed the task of rebuilding the team after basically being forced into selling his best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, to Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>Not only that but during this time, the economic climate of English football was radically changing. Free-spending Chelsea and Manchester City were breaking transfer records left and right, and Ferguson simply didn’t have the same amount of funds at his disposal.</p>\n<p>However, with his deft maneuvering in the transfer market, he built a squad that has now won the Premier League title two out of the last three years. United have also made two appearances in the Champions League final, but unfortunately were matched up against a Barcelona squad that many consider to be the best team of all-time.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, now that Sir Alex has announced he’s stepping down, it is time for everyone who enjoys the beautiful game, not just United fans, to look back and marvel at everything he has accomplished over his illustrious career. Indeed, we may never see another manager like him again.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Biology is something that students see in high school, they already have an exposure to it,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>Stopple acknowledged the tendency for biology majors to declare the major with a pre-med track in mind, only to realize how overwhelming the major can be later on.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes [they switch out] because their grades were not good enough to get into medical school. They think ‘well if I’m not going to be a doctor then, I don’t want to do biology after all,’” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> reached out to students to gain insight on their perspectives regarding the department of biological sciences at UCSB, and found several recurring complaints.</p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that S.T.E.M. majors be rigorous and require strong academic engagement, many students expressed frustration with the difficulty of prerequisite classes, as well as an initial lack of emphasis on biology during the foundational coursework.</p>\n<p>“A lot of Bio students come in unsuspecting of how difficult the gen chem series is, especially resenting it because they’re not interested in studying chem in the first place, or necessarily good at it,” second-year pre-biology major Aja Whitehead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students found that the administrators and advisors were at best overburdened and at worst outright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>“The school would probably like to think that the major is hard and that’s why people are dropping it, but in all honesty I think the lack of support from the department itself plays a larger role,” Aidan, a fourth-year biology major who declined to give their last name, said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had great professors, but the advisors and administrators have never been helpful to me.”</p>\n<p>Olivia, a fourth-year aquatic biology major who asked that her last name not be used, expressed similar discontent with advisors who she felt encouraged her to take an excessive course load during her first quarter after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I really do feel that students look to the advisors for guidance and help with structuring their plans here and they do not provide that,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>Ivan, a fourth-year biology major who asked that his last name not be used, was among a group of about 20 undergraduate molecular, cellular and developmental biology (MCDB) students who were part of an external review committee. The committee invites other faculty from universities around the west coast to evaluate the department, gather input from students and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>“The complaints against the Bio department were pretty strong… comments ranged from poor class structures during the first two years all the way to a deficit advisory team,” Ivan said.</p>\n<p>However, members of the faculty have coordinated with students in attempts to raise retention rates. Mike Wilton and Eduardo Gonzalez, two lecturers in the MCDB department, have worked to make more resources available to incoming freshmen who declare as pre-biology majors.</p>\n<p>Associated Students On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal has also been collaborating with Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) — alongside Wilton and Gonzalez — in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>“[Wilton and Gonzalez] introduced the mentoring series MCDB 11, 12 and 13, which are to be taken in conjunction with the gen chem series,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>MCDB 11, 12 and 13 serve as chemistry support classes, so one can establish a community of like-minded peers with who to study and hold each other accountable. For classes like the general chemistry series which lack a section, Nagpal believes that these provide a more collaborative and intimate setting.</p>\n<p>“Having these support programs that [Wilton and Gonzalez] create is essential to student success,” Nagpal said. “They see that students who take MCDB 11, 12 and 13… these students specifically have higher retention rates in the pre-biology major.”</p>\n<p>EOP students are a demographic which leave the biology major at a much higher rate than the general student body, Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>“Low-income students have to work for college compared to their more-privileged peers… because of this they can’t devote as much attention to their academics,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Nagpal is advocating for the expansion of financial support to more EOP-eligible students, which he hopes will alleviate some of this financial stress.</p>\n<p>“EOP has an emergency grant alongside A.S., and as a senator I have taken it upon myself to work with the director of EOP, Aaron Jones, to revise the A.S. EOP grant and essentially expand this,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Although a consensus from students is relatively easy to find just by surveying the academic body, extensive qualitative information regarding the “why” of switching majors has not been compiled.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to have more data in many ways, and know more about the process by which students change majors. We could do better generally, as a campus, in collecting data,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:46 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
