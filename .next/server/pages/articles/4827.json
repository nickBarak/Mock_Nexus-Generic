Now, 21 games in, the Gauchos are sitting pretty in first place of the league standings heading into its first week of Big West play.</p>\n<p>A 17-4 overall record through 21 games, regardless of competition, should not be overlooked, especially considering the Gauchos amassed a below average 51-60-1 overall record the prior two seasons.</p>\n<p>Still, a fast start such as this one will mean nothing if Santa Barbara cannot sustain this success where it matters most, conference play. And, first up on the league slate for UCSB is Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton who currently boasts just an 11-11 overall record to this point.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recent history would suggest that the Gauchos are poised for success this weekend. Last year, UCSB took two of three from the Titans, its first series win against CSUF since 2014.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara has historically struggled against Fullerton. In the Andrew Checketts era, UCSB has gone just 9-12 with no series wins at Fullerton. In fact, the last time the Gauchos bested the Titans was back in 2007 when they took two of three.</p>\n<p>Since then, UCSB has gone just 3-12 when playing at Goodwin Field, home of the four-time national champion CSUF. All-time, UCSB is 44-109 against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this Gaucho team is as prepared as any to take a series from the Titans at their home field.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into this game fresh off a loss against St. Mary’s in which it blew a 6-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Before the loss, Santa Barbara had won 15 of its last 16 matchups including three-weekend sweeps. In fact, UCSB has yet to lose a weekend series this year registering a 7-0 record scoring an average run of 7.9 runs per game.</p>\n<p>A big factor in that is due to the Gauchos hitting power as a squad. This season, UCSB has hit 25 round trippers to rank 23rd in the nation and nine different Gauchos have hit one through 21 games.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielders Tommy Jew and Armani Smith both lead the team in home runs each hitting six apiece. Jew and Smith also rank first (.695) and second (.633) in slugging percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>Overall, Jew has also been consistently getting on base with a .412 percentage which ranks fourth among starters while his .329 batting average ranks third among the same bunch.</p>\n<p>Arguably the best hitter on the team is still junior catcher Eric Yang. The man behind the dish has been spectacular when stepping up to it currently slashing .408/.505/.566. Both his batting average and his on-base percentage rank first on the team while his slugging ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>To start the series, Ben Brecht will also be on the mound for the Gauchos. The southpaw has been great garnering a 4-0 record with a 3.06 ERA to start the year.</p>\n<p>In his last three starts, he has struck out 29 batters in 20 innings pitched while allowing just 12 hits and five earned runs. In total, Brecht’s 50 strikeouts are the second most of any Big West pitcher.</p>\n<p>Brecht will have to be at the top of his game this series though as he is facing some serious athletes. CSUF boasts a strong pair of outfielders themselves as Isaiah Garcia and Mitchell Berryhill are the two best hitters on the team.</p>\n<p>Garcia leads the team in nearly every offensive category as he slashes .400/.477/.564. His 14 RBI’s rank second and he is only one of four batters to hit a home run this season.</p>\n<p>Berryhill is just as solid as he ranks second in batting average (.395) and fourth in slugging percentage (.461). The senior is also dangerous out on the basepaths as his five stolen bases are the best mark on the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also have to be wary of CSUF’s right-handed pitcher Tanner Bibee who will get the start on Friday. Bibee has a team-best ERA of 2.43 and has amassed a 3-3 overall record to this point. His 41 strikeouts are the third most by any pitcher in the league.</p>\n<p>This weekend is huge for Santa Barbara as it is a chance for them to show that it is for real. People could chalk up UCSB’s record due to its competition but shutting down a powerhouse like Fullerton would certainly speak for itself.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Fullerton in a three-game series beginning at 7 p.m. on Friday, Mar. 29 at Goodwin Field. Game two will be at 6 p.m. on Saturday while game three will be at 1 p.m. on Sunday at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

He added that UCGPC performs systemwide and statewide advocacy and often works with the UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel said that the timing of the UCOP’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-s-statement-her-invitation-meet-graduate-and-professional-council\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, combined with language that alluded to the potential discussion of a COLA, led some groups such as UCSC’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) to feel as if the UC was trying to circumvent ongoing demands for a COLA from organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel described the incident as a “misunderstanding” and said that UCGPC meets with Napolitano on a yearly basis, and, after its meeting in January 2020, UCGPC wanted to follow up with Napolitano on a handful of other issues. On Friday, Strobel said he was contacted by UCOP to meet again, to which UCGPC agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first discussion item listed in the UCOP press release was “cost of living,” followed by “housing.” Strobel maintained, however, that the meeting will not be about discussing a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole genesis of a potential board meeting with [Napolitano] and her team was to talk about state advocacy and some of the issues facing graduate students,” Strobel said. “But we’re not negotiating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that’s a sentiment she also expressed to me,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students across the UC system have now begun organizing for COLAs of their own, and at UC Santa Cruz, where graduate students have been on a formal strike since Feb. 10, they have withheld Fall Quarter 2019 grades as part of a wildcat strike. Last Friday, around 500 UC Santa Barbara graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the University Library to Cheadle Hall, where they occupied the space from 8 a.m. to midnight in solidarity with UCSC graduate students who were given a midnight deadline on Feb. 21 to end their strike and submit the grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, UCSC graduate students are still on strike, as the original Feb. 21 “doomsday” deadline to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades was extended to Feb. 27, according to an email sent to faculty and graduate students from Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UCOP press release sent out on Friday, UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, noting that UCSC does not have any representation on the council that she would be meeting with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For many reasons including, but not limited to, the fact that [UCGPC] does not represent our campus in any leadership or representational capacity, we are sorry to inform you that any decisions at which you may collectively arrive will not impact our organizing or our conviction,” the UCSC GSA wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, Cierra Sorin, president of UCSB’s GSA, said that the UCOP’s press release announcing a meeting with UCGPC was “uninspiring.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I don’t agree with that decision to reach out to UCGPC necessarily, since they have been pretty anti-COLA, I think it makes sense from a bureaucratic perspective,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Sorin said she doubted that UCGPC will specifically discuss a COLA at their meeting, she commented on UCGPC’s previous meeting at UCSB in early January, where she said “most of the folks in that room were anti-COLA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Sorin’s comments, Strobel said that UCGPC’s role is unrelated to the COLA movement. UCGPC is trying to alleviate rent burden through other measures, he said, such as reducing the cost of living for graduate students rather than advocating for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to go about it both in the the cost mitigating way, which is sort of open turf, like anyone can work on it,” Strobel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then in terms of increasing pay, that’s a little more of a complicated dance because you have other stakeholders who have been working on the issue for a long time, who have the legal first dibs to it, like the union, in which case we played an important, coalitionary partner to some of those folks,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents UC student workers at the bargaining table, UCGPC is a form of student of student government that describes its role as “complementary” to unions, according to the statement, and plans to continue advocating to “reduce the financial burden” of graduate students’ living expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of an ongoing battle between graduate students and the UC, Strobel asserted that UCGPC has no plan to negotiate a COLA in its upcoming meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think it was an honest misunderstanding,” he said.   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

A.S. is condemning these companies due to their involvement with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Both pieces of legislature, drafted by Off-Campus Senators Rafael Cornejo and Christian Ornelas, were student-sponsored by Rachel Andrews, Dylan Kupsh and A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>To attain “sanctuary status,” the school needs to meet several stipulations outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>Refusing to share information with immigration enforcement agencies, investing in “faculty and staff training to support undocumented students,” protecting students and faculty from deportation, barring I.C.E. from all UCSB-owned property and blocking “campus security” from asking about an “individual’s immigration status” all contribute to the definition of “sanctuary status,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for all current A.S. executive offices to “release a statement in support of the Undocumented community &amp; International Community at UCSB,” and for the A.S. Executive Director to “release a statement in support of UCSB as a ‘Sanctuary Campus.’”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also cited the Senate’s history of support for undocumented students by passing a resolution that supported voter rights for undocumented residents in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“This Senate and past Senates have history of supporting the undocumented community and it would be good to continue that. Earlier this year, we passed something about voter rights for undocumented folks in I.V. and it’s good to just do something on campus,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>Rachel Andrews, a second-year biopsychology major, spoke about the resolution during public forum. Andrews said undocumented students often fear being “separate from us, as if they’re not your neighbor or the person you’re sitting next to in class.”</p>\n<p>The bill carries similar sentiments to the resolution, with the exception that it is tailored specifically to UCSB-invested companies, stating that “Associated Students shall not provide assistance or resources” and will prohibit any presence of these companies in A.S. “physical space[s]” without the proper documentation to enter them.</p>\n<p>Also tacked onto the bill: “ASUCSB will no longer use e-verify in its practices in order to protect the identities of its undocumented members.” E-verify is a “web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States,” according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.e-verify.gov/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>While addressing the Senate, Kopel noted that she asked UC President Janet Napolitano if she plans to make UCSB a sanctuary campus. According to Kopel, Napolitano ultimately said she would not, citing fears that it would make UCSB a target if it were to assume the label of a “Sanctuary Campus.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Reasonably so, they claimed an easy 6-1 victory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Next were the No. 2 doubles teams. Thanks to the sophomore duo of Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, UCSB clenched the doubles point and granted the Gauchos an early advantage on the evening. No. 3 doubles resulted in Santa Barbara’s first loss as Pacific senior Miguel Diaz and freshman Ross Watson earned a 6-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Commencing the singles portion of the meet, Freund ousted the competition once more with matching 6-2 scores. Junior Cody Rakela continued the Gaucho streak as he won his singles matchup at 6-2 and 6-3. After Holm’s singles set, the tally was brought to 4-1, which practically ensured UCSB of an early win for the day.</p>\n<p>After junior Chase Masciorini’s 1-6/3-6 loss, the rest of the day resulted in Mays and Alboran tiebreaker matches. Eventually, the day’s final score finished at 4-3 as the Gauchos narrowly held off a late Pacific Tigers comeback.</p>\n<p>With that, UCSB returned to their winning mentality and improved to 3-1 on the season. Celebrations couldn’t last too long since the team was only allowed a night’s rest in preparation for their meet in Fresno, Calif. the following day.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, competition once again began with doubles play. Mays and Freund bested Fresno State senior Euan McIntosh and sophomore Patrik Pech with a close 6-4 score.</p>\n<p>Fresno State immediately responded with a 6-3 victory in the No. 2 doubles match, thanks to the Bulldogs duo of junior Youssef Hassan and freshman Zdenek Derkas.</p>\n<p>Reflecting off of the previous day’s results, the Gauchos knew how important this doubles point was. Luckily, Alboran and Holm secured the advantage with a 7-5 score in their match.</p>\n<p>As for the singles portion, Rakela delivered once more and extended the Gauchos lead with a 6-3/6-0 score. Mays provided UCSB with an even more comfortable lead as he won his match with 6-3 scores.</p>\n<p>For the 5th match spot, Hassan earned what would be the Bulldogs’ only point of the day, as he beat Masciorini with scores of 6-1 and 6-4.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the meet was total Gauchos dominance, as Freund, who is undefeated in both singles and doubles play, beat Derkas at 6-1 and 7-5. Alboran, 6-2/6-3, and Holm, 7-6(5)/6-3, closed out the day with two more Gaucho victories.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is much to be proud of over UCSB’s doubleheader sweep over the weekend. The team will return for a week’s worth of practice and downtime before heading out on the road for more regular season play.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s tennis season returns again on Feb. 25, away against San Francisco, and on the 26th, away against Cal Berkeley, as the team competes in another doubleheader weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75786\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/ucsb-claims-back-to-back-victories-over-pacific-and-fresno/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75786\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/ucsb-claims-back-to-back-victories-over-pacific-and-fresno/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/ucsb-claims-back-to-back-victories-over-pacific-and-fresno/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/ucsb-claims-back-to-back-victories-over-pacific-and-fresno/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/ucsb-claims-back-to-back-victories-over-pacific-and-fresno/","id":4826,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4825,4824,4823],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
