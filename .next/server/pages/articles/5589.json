Wilcox finished with a team high 15 kills on a kill percentage of .419; the team collectively finished with a hitting percentage of .398 as well. Keenan Sanders was expected to play an impact role in this matchup. Along with 12 total kills to his name, Sanders also finished with a game-high 12 blocks against the Matadors. Going forward, both players are sure to keep producing for their side as the Gauchos will face their toughest challenge in their semifinal matchup against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The first set began in a closely fought fashion. By the score mark of 10-10, there had already been 8 different instances where the teams had brought the scores back to level. Soon after, the Gauchos started to slowly chip away at this and break free for a small lead of their own. Off a setup by Wilcox, junior setter Randy DeWeese earned a kill that would bring UCSB’s lead to 5, at 15-20. The Matadors would only go on to manage a single other point before the set was closed out and the Gauchos had earned a 1-0 start with a final set score of 25-16.</p>\n<p>CSUN would go on to bring that initial intensity back as the second set proved even closer than the first. With leads never surpassing more than two points at any moment in this set, the Gauchos found themselves constantly trailing without being able to find a rhythm of their own. It wasn’t until DeWeese assisted a kill by Wilcox late in the set that the Gauchos manage to bring things all level at 18-18. Still, the lead continued to evade UCSB but they managed to tie the match up four more times through the remainder of the set. Ultimately, the Matadors managed to close out this one as the final set score came in at 27-25 and the set tally on the night stood at 1-1.</p>\n<p>The third set similarly followed the nail biting trend, as it once again took extra points to decide the set victor. The Matadors looked to build off the momentum from the previous set, and once more it was the Gauchos who were trailing for the majority of it. It wasn’t until the 17-17 mark that UCSB found its first tie of the set, off a kill by Spencer Fredrick set up by DeWeese. The Gauchos would go on to earn a slight 2-point lead deep into the third set, but unfortunately they couldn’t get the job done in the final moments as the Matadors snatched this one at 28-26.</p>\n<p>Now in a make or break set, the Gauchos started the fourth set in inspired form as they raced out to a 15-6 lead following excellent offensive play and several mistakes on CSUN’s end. As the set progressed UCSB’s lead did as well, Sanders and senior outside hitter Corey Chavers lead their side to a 25-13 set victor, a performance worthy of a top-4 program.</p>\n<p>With the set tally all even at 2-2, a fifth set was needed to decide this quarterfinals matchup, and the Gauchos were up to the task once more. Again, UCSB raced out to another massive early lead, and another Spencer kill assisted by DeWeese brought the score to 11-3. At this point it was far too late for the Matadors to salvage their season. However, at game point, CSUN found a second-wind of four scores in a row that brought the tally to 14-9. Nevertheless, the Gauchos got the job done at 15-9, earning themselves a 3-2 matchup win that advances them to the Big West Semifinals.</p>\n<p>Next up for No. 4 UCSB is a meeting with the best in the nation, No. 1 Long Beach State. This semifinal bout will be the Gauchos’ biggest challenge of the season yet, with both teams hungry for a playoff finals spot, this one’s shaping up to be another stellar opportunity for elite college volleyball.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Long Beach State are set to duke it out tonight, April 19<sup>th</sup>, at 8 PM, in the tournament location of Honolulu, Hawai’i.</p><div

Sophomore utility Sarah Snyder led the way with four goals while freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck had six saves in front of the cage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their previous matchup, which dates back to last season, Hawaii won 8-3 behind a high-powered offense that averaged 10 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has won six of their last seven games by an average margin of seven goals.</p>\n<p>They last played against No. 14 Long Beach State in their last home game of the season and won by a score of 12-6. Sophomore utility Maartje Keuning led the way as she netted four goals, giving her 36 on the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Irene Gonzales netted a hat trick on the game as well, adding to her team-leading record of 49 goals, which also leads the Big West.</p>\n<p>It will be crucial for the ‘Chos to limit the amount of chances Hawaii has on goal by continuing to stay consistent with their defensive energy throughout the entire game.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii has very good shooters,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “I think they have a lot of fire power so we are going to need to be able to really lock down on defense and get some good shot blocks.”</p>\n<p>As winners of seven of their last 10 games, UC Davis will look to continue their hot streak by relying primarily on their potent offense as they average 11 goals per game on the year.</p>\n<p>The Aggies were last in action this past weekend when they won a thriller against No. 9 UC Irvine. Senior center Greta Kohlmoos had a hat trick on the day while sophomore goalkeeper Caitlin Golding had seven saves.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to have success against UC Davis, it will be crucial for the ‘Chos to slow down junior utility Annie Kutt, who leads the team with 73 points on the year, consisting of 32 goals and 41 assists.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling on offense in the prior two games before CSUN, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm offensively, primarily due to the play of Snyder.</p>\n<p>Snyder comes into this game as the third-leading goal scorer in the conference. With 45 goals on the year, she has already passed last year’s personal scoring record by 10 goals and still has two regular season games as well as the Big West Tournament to add to it.</p>\n<p>“She has been inspiring,” Kay stated. “I think it is important for her to realize that she does lead our team and there is a target on her back, which makes it a little more challenging for herself but that will lead to other people being open.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman attacker Mollie Simmons continues her diverse level of play in terms of goals, sprints and steals. The San Jose native currently has 17 goals and 33 steals on the year and has consistently won sprints to start off the period and give the Gauchos early momentum.</p>\n<p>“She is only a freshman and I think there is such room for growth from her,” Kay said. “I am excited for what is going to come in the future.”</p>\n<p>Both Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder continue to split time in front of the cage and will look to continue their dominance as of late. With 10 saves and two steals combined in their last game, they have made it extremely difficult for opponents to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“I think their presence was good,” Kay said. “They have been communicating very well and that is something we have been focusing on.”</p>\n<p>With just two games remaining before the Big West Tournament, UCSB will look to increase their seed in the Big West Standings as they are currently in fifth place. If they win both games, they will put themselves in a great position to secure at least a top-three seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to add on to their one-game win streak as they host both Hawaii and Davis this weekend in Santa Barbara at 12 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 12th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/","id":5586,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[5585,5584,5583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2019-20 Season Preview: Women’s Volleyball Team Hoping to Turn Individual Accolades Into Team Success","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2019-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team are hoping that their combination of young talent and experienced veterans will lead them to their first Big West title since 2013.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_85075\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"810582656\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89632\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85075\" data-attachment-id=\"85075\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/freshman-setter-olivia-lovenburgs-immediate-impact/olivia-lovenburg-sets-for-zoe-fleck-angie-banks-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WVolleyball-vsCalPoly-Nov0218-AngieBanks-9-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Olivia Lovenburg sets for Zoe Fleck.

The rebound was a team effort that featured top-level contributions from a variety of positions and experience levels.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ultimately invited to the National Invitational Volleyball Championship after finishing 9-7 in league play and winning their last three games, including two back-to-back sweeps.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 9-7 league record was their best since the 2013 season and they will be looking to improve as they begin the 2019-20 season this weekend.</p>\n<p>It should be an uphill battle though, as conference rivals Cal Poly, Hawai’i and UC Irvine finished last season with conference records of 15-1, 14-2 and 10-6 respectively.</p>\n<p>An eleven-game stretch near the start of the season features one matchup with Irvine and two with Hawai’i, as well as two Blue-Green rivalries. That means five of those eleven games will be against last year’s top three conference teams including UCSB’s archrival. This stretch also features two matchups with UC Davis and two with Long Beach State, the two schools who finished just below UCSB in the Big West standings. UCSB split the two-game series with both schools last year.</p>\n<p>This stretch will almost guarantee UCSB’s position as an elite club or expose the team as a one-season wonder.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be especially careful not to let their emotions get the best of them in the games against Cal Poly, as the Mustangs’ defense was frustrating to play against last year and their offense was efficient.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Torrey Van Winden led the Big West in hitting percentage at .365 while teammate Meredith Phillips was ranked fourth with a .328. The Big West’s leader in blocks per set was also led by Mustang Madilyn Mercer who posted a 1.12. Not a single Gaucho was in the top five of either category.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s stingy defense and crazy efficient offense catapulted them to a 15-1 conference record and a 25-3 overall.</p>\n<p>Individual efforts were the premier highlights for the Gauchos in 2018-19, and they will be looking to put it all together into team success this season. The Blue-Green matchup will showcase some of the league’s best talents as well the Big West’s fiercest rivalry. Each game will be a must-watch.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begin the season on Friday, Aug. 23 with a home scrimmage against CSU Bakersfield.

University as part of the Buffs Invitational on August 30. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the Gauchos were selected to be the third-best team in the conference in a preseason coaches poll, teams will definitely be looking to make a statement by beating the ‘Chos. Even before playing a single game the Gauchos face an immense amount of pressure to play up to the expectations league-wide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has lost one of its premier players Emilia Petrachi who is a vocal veteran leader. It’s even more imperative now more than ever that the ‘Chos get out to a good start and don’t fall behind early and play catch-up like last season.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the consistent leadership presence of a veteran like Petrachi the team needs less-featured players to take the next step and fill the void if they want any chance to come close to their expectations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, look for sophomore Gigi Ruddins and her older sister senior Lindsey Ruddins to make a statement. Lindsey is as decorated as any player in the league – boasting a three-time AVCA All-American Honorable Mention selection and putting up an outworldly 5.34 k/s which ranks her as the second-most efficient outside in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gigi will be looking to take that next step as she fills the role Petrachi played. After putting up an impressive freshman season (All-Big West Freshman Team) the ‘Chos desperately need her to post another stellar season for them to reach anywhere close to their potential. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main weakness for this Gaucho team at the moment seems to be their blocking with their lineups featuring an undersized setter, Olivia Lovenberg, who is 5’8”. Her efficiency on offense negates this as she leads the conference in assists and became the second player to reach 1000 assists. Expect games this season to become Big 12 football-style shootouts, as Lovenberg airs out sets to premier hitters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a star-studded offensive unit we would also be remiss if we did not mention middle Rowan Ennis. With the elite Ruddins sisters playing outside and a facilitator like Lovenberg, expect Ennis to put up big numbers as well, especially considering the amount of defensive pressure Lindsey absorbs on her own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Long Island University team the ‘Chos will play against has a roster with a very high upside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of their blocking, the LIU team runs a high octane offense run by setter Amanda Hubbard. In order for the Guachos to win tomorrow look for them to use their high tempo offense to beat out the LIU blockers to generate long point streaks and keeping the LIU team from getting in system. Where “in system” refers to being capable of setting the middle in a given play. Without being able to set the middle, the opposing blocking middle has an easier time cheating to either end to put up a block – which greatly improves the outcome for the defending team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team this young there are a lot of x factors, but the biggest one will most likely be Ennis. If she can take her offensive efficiency up a notch and continue to be an unstoppable force on defense, the sky’s the limit for this group of ‘Chos. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-30/ucsb-set-to-take-on-long-island-university-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-30/ucsb-set-to-take-on-long-island-university-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-30/ucsb-set-to-take-on-long-island-university-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-30/ucsb-set-to-take-on-long-island-university-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-30/ucsb-set-to-take-on-long-island-university-in-season-opener/","id":5588,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[5587,5586,5585],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
