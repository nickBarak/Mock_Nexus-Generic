It was April 7, a Thursday night, and the venue was nowhere near its capacity. Nevertheless, DiMona proceeded to play his remix of Blackbear’s “90210.” There was a wave of head bobbing as the song played and the pace stayed moderate as he went on to play his song “I Just Want You.” After giving the crowd a taste of his own music, DiMona filled the venue with some nostalgic vibes as he played “Bartender” by T-Pain. Everyone sang along as the soulful jam boomed from the loudspeakers.</p>\n<p>After the R&amp;B hit was over, it was clear that everyone was ready for more. At this point what was once a room filled with a few heads bobbing back and forth was now one with the nightclub aesthetic. A slight pause went by, and the words “Your love is fadin’” filled the room as the song “Fade” by Kanye West came on. The audience rocked back and forth with intensity as the funky vibrations shook the room. Not only was DiMona able to make great use of one of West’s newest songs, but he also managed to resurrect the sensational music of R&amp;B artist Frank Ocean as he played his song “Lost.” The crowd yelled in agreement with the DiMona as he questioned “Yo, when is Frank Ocean going to drop that album though?!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69887\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69887\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1782381608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69887\" data-attachment-id=\"69887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69887\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-3-e1460711552276.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As DiMona made subtle transitions between electronic and rock music — ranging from from Blood Orange to music with a much more house-like feel — the energy levels only became higher and more intense. It was clear that DiMona was feeling the liveliness of the crowd, seeing as he was jumping up and down and encouraging those around him to join him. Just as the crowd thought he was finished, the DJ yelled, “Yo, you guys down to listen to a song I’ve never performed before?” Of course, the audience yelled in excitement as his never before heard tune came on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was a bittersweet ending to an amazing set list, but the night was not over at the Hub. Goldroom had yet to reach the stage but everyone continued dancing, keeping the upbeat mood alive. The tone was set in stone as the Goldroom crew proceeded to set up their variety of instruments.</p>\n<p>There was a unique array of sounds infused throughout the venue as the six-person group began their set for the night. The musicians began the night by performing their song “Only You Can Show Me,” and as the audience engaged themselves in the sensational sounds that the tropical band had to offer, it was clear that the Gauchos were digging the music.</p>\n<p>“Her voice is crazy!” yelled one of the audience members in reference to the female vocalist. For a brief moment the singer stood in the middle of the stage, and as she sang “Till Sunrise” the melodious lyrics pierced through the crowd and echoed throughout the venue. Josh Legg, the mastermind behind the production and lyrics of the music Goldroom has to offer, has stated that he enjoys switching up the musicians for his live performances. It makes for a unique show with unpredictable outcomes seeing as everyone is artistic and skilled in their own way.</p>\n<p>Along with the beautiful vocals that Goldroom provided came the energetic instrumentals. From the drums, guitar, bass, keyboard and even the chimes, every instrument played a crucial role in the live performance. It was dance music with a serene and passionate feeling throughout the crowd. Although it was a bit awkward when Legg announced, “Find somebody to make out with,” as the song “Fifteen” came on, there was a sense of relief when Goldroom played what was deemed to be a new song called “Breaks.”</p>\n<p>“This song can be a break from anything, really.” Legg said, and it was just that: a break from reality.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, you guys are beautiful!” said Legg as he and the rest of the group made their way off the stage. However, that was not enough for the Gauchos on that Thursday night; they fiended for more, and as they yelled, “Encore!” over and over again, Goldroom came back to the stage to perform one last song for the deserving audience. In an interview a few days prior to the concert, Legg stated that a good crowd for him is one that is not “cool” but is willing to embrace the music, dance and have fun. That night, the Hub’s audience, without a doubt, met his expectations.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_69888\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69888\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"185469295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69978\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69888\" data-attachment-id=\"69888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/goldroom-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Goldroom by Jenny Luo 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69888\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Goldroom-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-e1460711602882.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-15/the-hub-gets-painted-goldroom/","id":6751,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6750,6749,6748],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales","biography":"Not available","articles":[5759,5772,5899,6167,6528,6609,6614,6637,6644,6646,6653,6749,6751,6768,6799],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Anoushka Shankar Charms Campbell Hall","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3284-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3284-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"Anoushka Shankar brought her intricate skill and her international musical background to Campbell Hall on Monday night with a concert celebrating her new album Land of Gold.

The murmuring chatter of the audience began to die down until the only perceptible sound was a steady note from the ensemble’s backing track. The ensemble waited with readiness at their instruments as Shankar gently tuned her sitar. She paused, then with a graceful flick of her wrist she began to fill the theater with clear, plucking notes.</p>\n<p>Anoushka Shankar brought her intricate skill and her international musical background to Campbell Hall on Monday night with a concert celebrating her new album <em>Land of Gold</em>. The renowned sitar player and composer has been performing since age 13 and has received five Grammy Award Nominations. Her original compositions seek to use the traditionally Indian sitar across various genres and in both classical and modern styles. <em>Land of Gold </em>seeks to bring cultures together.</p>\n<p>“It’s moments like these where there’s a connection with you, a connection with us,” Shankar said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The concert was dynamic and varied throughout, with changing styles, different combinations of instruments and rapidly shifting tones. The fast tempo and mixture of instruments in “Secret Heart” got the audience’s feet tapping from the start. Sanjeev Shankar’s high, clear notes on the shehnai kept pace with the quick plucking of the sitar in perfect harmony. Manu Delago added lower harmony on the hang with smooth tapping from one end of his instrument to the other. During the quiet interludes of the song, the drawn-out notes of the shehnai provided a dramatic difference from the pounding beat and full sound.</p>\n<p>“Dissolving Boundaries” began with gentle notes from the sitar, creating a relaxing atmosphere. As Shankar began increasing the tempo of her strumming and plucking, Tom Farmer’s soft piano notes joined in rhythmic melody. The building combinations of instruments in harmony were intercut with moments of only slow sitar plucking. Suddenly and jarringly, the music was interrupted by a news sound bite playing, a newscaster reporting on an influx of refugees in a professional tone. The musicians continued playing as the sound bite faded to become part of the background rhythm, melding into the song. Shankar had included the newscast to express the larger theme of her album. She explained, “The process of making this music was in response to the current refugee crisis.”</p>\n<p>The hardships of refugees and the themes of fear and the unknown were explored further in “Crossing The Rubicon.” Shankar described her ideas of people crossing the Rubicon River or refugees travelling to a new country as people “going all the way.” She said solemnly, “This music is an interpretation of what it must be like for those people.” The song began slowly and ominously with a delicate melody on the hang and slow sitar strumming, creating a mournful tone. The tempo and volume began increasing gradually as Shankar’s notes on the sitar became more harsh and pronounced. The building music created an increasing feeling of suspense. The sudden burst of booming bass and pounding drums filled the theatre in the song’s climactic moment, as though mimicking the rush of fleeing people.</p>\n<p>The entire ensemble truly demonstrated their rapid skills during “Last Chance.” Quiet trills from Shankar’s sitar and occasional booms from Farmer’s bass created a mysterious atmosphere in the song’s opening. Unexpectedly, a quick pounding beat from Delago’s small, hand-held drum signaled the beginning of a jolting tempo increase. Shankar’s hands flew up and down the sitar with lightning fast precision, bringing the audience to their feet with applause. Quick, powerful bursts from the bass added body to the pulsing rhythm that vibrated throughout the theatre. The fluidity of Shankar’s notes increased as lights flashed around the theatre, resembling a rock concert.</p>\n<p>As the cheering and whistling from the audience began to die down, Shankar introduced her last piece, smiling as she said, “I’m trying to end with a little bit of hope.” The song, “Reunion,” expressed a lighthearted tone with its major key and quick, light plucking on the sitar. Delago’s soft beat complimented the gentle melody and left pauses for Shankar’s sitar to pierce the stillness with clear high notes. All instruments in the ensemble came together at the song’s end along with a prerecorded chorus of voices to create a sense of unity.</p>\n<p><em>Land of Gold</em> expressed an intersection of antiquity and progressiveness, of home and places unknown and of Western and Eastern music. Shankar’s compositions and their use of both traditional Indian instruments and innovative musical techniques represented the complexity of the artist herself while also creating varied musical narratives. Anoushka Shankar’s<em> Land of Gold </em>was a dynamic melding of style, culture and intricate talent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70177\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70177\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-20/anoushka-shankar-charms-campbell-hall/","id":6748,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6747,6746,6745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"María del Pilar Shares Truth in Song at MCC","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maria-Del-Pilar-5-17-3-e1463528105807.jpg?resize=350%2C525&ssl=1","description":"“Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor.” The words rolled off smoothly as del Pilar strummed the strings of her ukulele.

Throughout del Pilar’s performance it was clear that embracing who she is a motto that she lives by.</p>\n<p>Just about every seat in the building was taken and the crowd was filled with a variety of people. It was a fusion of cultures; the conversations that went on in the venue were in several different languages. People were anxious and a few minutes had already passed by after the scheduled start time. Despite the slight delay, the performer did not waste any time in delivering her eclectic sounds. Immediately after taking the stage, del Pilar took control and made the building a place full of energy. Her first song was intense. The way she sang was so passionate that it caught the crowd off guard.</p>\n<p>“<em>Tu y yo bailamos, con mucho vigor</em> (You and I dance vigorously).” the intimate words rolled off of her tongue smoothly as she strummed the strings of her ukulele. The passion from her high-pitched vocals resonated throughout the room. Del Pilar’s fluorescent vocals were also accompanied by some amazing electric guitar accompaniment. The guitarist’s solos were intricate and very well done. The riffs vibrated throughout the room and created a powerful and alternative aesthetic. All the sounds going on meshed together perfectly and created a pretty and melodic vibe within the small venue.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After just about each one of the songs she performed, del Pilar shared some insight about her life with the crowd. She spoke about the bicultural influence that has inspired her to bring about this English and Spanish blend.</p>\n<p>“I started off with a band called ‘Los Abandoned,’” del Pilar shared. “We started somewhat of a Spanglish scene in Los Angeles. I just thought I should share with you all some of my back story since you may be wondering why I am dressed the way I am.”</p>\n<p>Del Pilar, embracing her roots, danced on stage wearing high-waisted pants and a large flower around her neck. Her energy rubbed off on the audience, and people were either standing and dancing — which del Pilar highly encouraged — or bobbing their heads and tapping their feet. It was evident that the artist has a rebellious soul and that all she wants is to have fun doing what she loves most: sharing her art with others and empowering those who face similar circumstances as hers. She spoke about the obstacles that her father had to overcome in order to provide her with a good life. Her father’s will to strive is what fueled her ambitions to be not only a musical artist but also a role model to others.</p>\n<p>“I am still going to do my thing despite anything that comes my way,” del Pilar exclaimed as she began her final song of the night.</p>\n<p>The singer finished off her setlist with her song “Quien Eres.”</p>\n<p>“This song is about not being afraid of who you are,” she stated. It was [[a]] night of Chilean alternative pop with a hint of young angst. Once the event was over just about everyone in attendance stood in line and waited to pick up a copy of del Pilar’s album <em>Songs+Canciones I</em>. I made sure not to leave without grabbing one for myself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71077\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71077\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-17/maria-del-pilar-shares-truth-in-song-at-mcc/","id":6749,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6748,6747,6746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Election 2016: 6 Songs for a Young, Apprehensive Voter","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fc8a3eb0-400c-44d9-9378-d95b7a2e94ac.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fc8a3eb0-400c-44d9-9378-d95b7a2e94ac.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There is a strong undercurrent of apathy buoying this election season, and the brunt of it is being felt by us young voters. We are facing an unprecedented amount of pressure right now, trying to figure out how the decisions made by us and for us will affect our futures. Politically charged music has been created throughout the years for this very reason and have consequentially become classic anthems of unrest. There is a new class of songs that have been created with the same purpose and carry the same weight that political songs of the past did for our parents.</p>\n<p>Baby Boomers gave way to Generation X, and Generation X gave way to Millennials. Each generation of young people comes with their own set of large-scale anxieties and therefore creates art to serve as both a response and a relic as time goes on. Younger generations do not only serve as tastemakers in culture, but they also have the power to completely shift the tide of politics. This is especially important in this election because Tuesday’s outcome does not only have obvious partisan and economic implications, but monumental cultural implications as well. We can confront this in the best way <em>we</em> know how: Let’s cling to our technology, put our earphones on and reflect on politically aware songs of the past and present.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol>\n<li>“Mr. November” by The National</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This song was written during the latter half of George W. Bush’s second term. The National seem to scrutinize career politicians like Bush: blue-blooded, Ivy League men who have consistently led our country. The titular “Mr. November” churns through an overwrought, aggressive internal monologue. “I won’t fuck us over, I’m Mr. November,” lead singer Matt Berninger sings in a way that strains his voice beyond comfort. The pressures leading the country pose to any potential leader are captured by the song’s pounding, kick-crash drums that carry the song’s angst to unfathomable heights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjszc2YOAE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>“Young Americans” by David Bowie</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For clarification’s sake, Bowie was British in every single sense of the word. Even from the other side of the ocean, however, he was fascinated by our way of handling political unrest: specifically, the widespread uneasiness that characterized Nixon’s presidency and how young people acted upon the way they felt. This and Bowie’s use of elements from soul music of the ‘70s, characterized the album <em>Young Americans</em> as a whole. This song is upbeat, which makes it easier to find positivity in being unestablished but still in control of our futures.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSHY1_ux8rs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>“Fortunate Son” by Creedence Clearwater Revival</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a communication class I am taking this quarter, the professor screened an advertisement featuring this iconic track written by war veteran and lead singer of CCR, John Fogerty. It was an advertisement for jeans; denim as a symbol of classic American ideals is analogous to apple pie. However, the professor mentioned the irony of this song being used in the commercial as a positive representation of being an American citizen because it is a blatant criticism of young men being drafted for the Vietnam War. America, of course, is not currently under the threat of war, but it is important to remember that although for different reasons, young people in the ‘60s were facing just as much — if not more — discontent with our country as we are now.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec0XKhAHR5I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>“Holy Shit” by Father John Misty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Singer-songwriter, amateur comedian and all-around magnetic persona Josh Tillman, also known as Father John Misty, is famous for his commentary on the state of love as it relates to everything. Whether it be religion, technology or politics, he glides through it all, acoustic guitar and silky voice softening his tongue-in-cheek criticisms. In this track from his sophomore effort <em>I Love You, Honeybear</em>, his disillusionment with the issues our country is constantly bombarded with is clear. He is a part of the group of people in the grey area between Generation X and Millennials, and his music reflects his uncertainty in his position. Tillman is well aware of how the problems we are facing are affecting us, but he is unsure of how to confront them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TXdtZLrsZc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of the many stories I’ve heard from my mother about my great-grandfather, one of the fondest is her memory of this song by Marvin Gaye, his favorite classic soul track. My own memories of him are blurry because he passed away when I was young, but I can imagine him sitting at the kitchen table, shaking his head at all of the confusion going on in the world and tapping his cigarette into an ash tray. The finger snaps and doo-wop singing in the background of the record give it a pool hall feel, but it is instantly elevated by the impassioned lyrics and string orchestration in the foreground. This song, like “Fortunate Son,” is anti-Vietnam, but it is more of a plea than a protest. With the current state of conflict within this country, this would still be my grandfather’s favorite song if he were alive. Because certain tracks have a way of bridging gaps between multiple generations, it is just as relevant to me as it was to him.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-kA3UtBj4M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although Dylan is practically the father of musical activism, this track is not explicitly political. “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,” he sings, as though he is soothing a crying child, and it is a sentiment which can quell the worry of almost any problem. Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion we are feeling this election season is uncertainty. No matter who you are voting for, the outcome this year is quite uncertain. But, in a way, it is comforting to know it is floating somewhere in the universe, and we will figure it out very soon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWwgrjjIMXA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
