Farr also discussed the process currently underway attempting to establish a form of local government in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, after the terrible events of last year, the issue really came to the floor again,” Farr said. “Associated Students became interested in it, trustees became interested in it, and so I thought well if there’s this much support, then maybe it’s time to take a look at it and see if there’s a way to craft something that would be unique to Isla Vista that would best fit the needs of Isla Vista and provide more representation on a wide variety of issues.”</p>\n<p>California State Assembly Member for Santa Barbara Das Williams, an alumnus and I.V.-native, introduced a bill early in December into the California state legislature seeking to establish I.V. as a community services district (CSD), a form of local government allowing an unincorporated area to provide services for itself independent of county oversight.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the bill does not yet outline the specific brand of self-governance I.V. will potentially take on, but rather serves as a proclamation that can be amended when more concrete plans are established.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a placeholder … after the series of meetings [Williams] is having are over with and the community has reached some consensus on what they want it to say, then he would amend the bill to include that in it and then it would start through the regular legislative process,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>While Farr said she commends the ongoing town hall meetings that have served as forums for students and I.V. residents to discuss forms of self-governance, Farr also said she is concerned that the expectations of Isla Vistans may not meet the reality of a local government once it is implemented.</p>\n<p>“I am supportive if the community can find some sort of consensus; I think my greatest concern is that a lot of people don’t understand what it could do and what it couldn’t do,” Farr said. “At the end of the day if something was formed I wouldn’t want people to be disappointed.”</p>\n<p>Farr said it is currently unclear exactly what a governing body in I.V. would look like, but said one possible scenario of self-governance could include a governing board made up of a variety of representatives from I.V. and the university.</p>\n<p>“I think people are looking for a body that sits locally,” Farr said. “I think in this case it might be some sort of board where there is representation from the county, the university, elected representatives from the community [and] some appointed property owners. I guess we’ll have to see what comes out of the discussions that Assembly Member Williams is having.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the creation of a local government in I.V. could also lead to the introduction of local taxes or fees that would help fund local services and projects.</p>\n<p>Farr also said one of the new services I.V. could benefit from is the introduction of a community resource officer, an individual “who could really be a full time, hands on liaison between the community and law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Assembly Member Williams’s bill will be amended in the upcoming months to include detailed plans for I.V. self-governance as public discussions continue. The next town hall regarding the bill and its contents will be held Feb. 5 in a location in I.V. to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/","id":4793,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4792,4791,4790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Assemblyman Holds I.V.

That’s my endgame.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, all individuals invested in the I.V. community are invited to participate in town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“Eventually, everyone who will be here will always have this government to help us aid them,” Minoeifar said. “So, just because you’re not going to be here when you graduate doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be here.

LAFCO is a state-mandated agency present in every California county to oversee the formation of CSDs. AB 3 would establish, by act of the state legislature, an I.V. CSD and thereby bypass the traditional role of LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>The letter was drafted and released at LAFCO’s Feb. 5 meeting and enumerates 11 concerns held by the commission over the bill, primarily regarding the bill’s current lack of specificity over the types of services that would be available in an I.V. CSD and how they would be paid for. Additional concerns questioned the role of the county, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and UCSB in a CSD, the makeup of the administrative board in a CSD and how the CSD would be governed after it is formed.</p>\n<p>The commission heard over two dozen speakers during its roughly hour-long public comment period, with primarily I.V. residents, property owners and students voicing their concerns.

We already have law enforcement there,” Mitchell said. “We have a government that deals with those issues already … by creating more government you are asking the students to pay more, you are asking the residents to pay more … we have enough government in Isla Vista already.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61165\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61165\" data-attachment-id=\"61165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/lafco_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424356580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61165\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.

By overturning our role in the process to a board like LAFCO we remove our hand from this important step.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also said LAFCO should work to ease tensions between residents of I.V. and LAFCO in order to allow the community to address the concerns the commission is taking on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have some trust issues with you all and I would feel that as a board who is made to represent the interests and assert the interests of local districts you would all be willing to compromise with us on that and understand that,” Schunk said. “By allowing us the determination of continuing these talks … you allow us to move forward and answer the very questions you have presented.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman has agreed to work on a financial feasibility study for an I.V. CSD, and sociology professor Victor Rios has begun an effort to attain $18,000 of university money to fund a demographics study of I.V., to meet the concerns of the LAFCO. Schunk and other speakers also encouraged LAFCO commissioners attend the weekly stakeholders meetings taking place in I.V. to flesh out the specifics of the bill.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Geyer said LAFCO members may be limited in their ability to attend stakeholders meetings because of the Brown Act, a piece of legislation guaranteeing the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>“It is hard for commissioners to come to meetings because of the Brown Act,” Geyer said. “We can violate the Brown Act in a very easy manner and I think that’s probably why a lot of us don’t attend.”</p>\n<p>Following public comment, commissioner Moorhouse said LAFCO’s purpose is to create local governments and to encourage county, state and university administrations to assist in demographic and financial feasibility studies.</p>\n<p>“Opposing AB 3 does not mean that LAFCO opposes I.V. self-governance,” Moorhouse said, “LAFCO exists to create local governance, among other things. We are here to help and there is an established process to follow and it works.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2006 law updating the CSD formation process, part of LAFCO’s role in creating a CSD is to ensure 25 percent of residents of the proposed CSD area sign a petition indicating support for the effort.</p>\n<p>Geyer said LAFCO’s role is to ensure public participation in the CSD formation process and expressed concern about inaccessibility of the bill once it moves along in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>“The formation of anything, any special district in Isla Vista, should come back to the local LAFCO. That’s what we are here for. That’s why the legislature invented LAFCO, and LAFCO locally [allows] the public to be involved,” Geyer said. “When this thing heads up to Sacramento, you think you have a hard time making it here [to downtown Santa Barbara], you’re gonna have a real hard time making it up there.”</p>\n<p>The commission amended the several points on the letter before approving it for release. The commission eliminated the first sentence on point three, which falsely stated the bill was introduced in December without public outreach on the concept, when in fact two town hall-style meetings had occurred in the months prior to determine an appropriate form of local government for I.V.</p>\n<p>The commission amended language on point three to reflect concerns that LAFCO would be bypassed as a result of “commission meetings” rather than “community meetings” because of a lack of familiarity with the content of the stakeholders and town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>On item nine, the commission deleted the final sentence, which stated “LAFCO has no authority to deviate from the CSD law regarding makeup of the CSD board” and inserted, “However, if it is determined that state legislation is needed, it could be requested by Santa Barbara LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>On item 11, the language was changed from “if the Isla Vista CSD is formed with LAFCO approval” to “if Isla Vista CSD is formed without LAFCO approval, would the district be subject to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act after the … CSD is formed?”</p>\n<p>Finally, the commission agreed to issue the revised letter undersigned by LAFCO executive officer Paul Hood, rather than LAFCO chair Farr, who opposed moving forward with the letter and had her name signed to the draft released Feb. 5.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They rank 2<sup>nd</sup> in the Big West in batting average (.297), and on-base percentage (.410), while ranking first in runs scored (88), hits (121), and extra-base hits (26).</p>\n<p>UCSB’s slew of hitters starts with sophomore designated hitter Austin Bush. The DH leads the team and is fourth in the Big West in batting average (.429), first in the team and fifth in the Big West in RBI (12), and first on his team in hits (15).</p>\n<p>Another great hitter has been redshirt junior Andrew Calica. The center fielder has been a great leadoff hitter and is currently first on the team in on-base percentage (.557), third in hits (13) and fifth in batting average (.325).</p>\n<p>Other great hitters include redshirt sophomore J.J Muno who is third in hits with 13 and senior third baseman Ryan Clark who is second on the team in hits (14), and third in batting average (.368).</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff for the Gauchos on Friday’s opening match-up is junior Shane Bieber. The right-handed pitcher is currently 2-1 on the season but has struggled a bit posting a 5.40 ERA, 28<sup>th</sup> in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, he is helped by a solid bullpen led by left hander Kyle Nelson who has had an amazing start to the season. The sophomore has allowed only nine hits on the season and no earned runs in 16.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Dating back to last season, he has gone 43 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run, the longest active streak in the NCAA and a UCSB record. He is one of 26 pitchers that currently has a 0.00 ERA.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has not lost a home series to a non-conference opponent since 2013 and hopes to keep it that way against Hartford, a team they have never dropped a series against in school history.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is Friday, March 11 against the University of Hartford at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s game is at 2 p.m. as well while Sunday’s begins at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
