The grand opening included a demonstration of a Kundalini yoga class for attendees and performances by Sukhdev Jackson of the musical group Aykanna and local singer and songwriter Gabriel Kelly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident and Yin Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Dolliane Lipman said the studio will offer an opportunity for I.V. residents to participate in a neighborhood activity.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really great idea to have a yoga community in Isla Vista, just somewhere people can come and … heal, because there’s a lot of negative stuff that’s happened here,” Lipman said.</p>\n<p>Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Peter Stephan said many of the instructors connect deeply to Kundalini yoga, a tradition Yogi Bhajan brought to the west in 1968. According to Stephan, Kundalini yoga focuses on conscious experience.</p>\n<p>“Kundalini is the yoga of awareness, there’s a real emphasis on the community… and it incorporates all the other styles of yoga,” Stephan said. “Kundalini is all about the direct, personal experience.”<br>\nStephan said he encourages students and I.V. residents to try yoga even if they are unsure about the activity.</p>\n<p>“My advice would be to show up and experience the technology. It’s a science because there are steps that, if taken, give guaranteed results. It’s simply about taking those steps,” Stephan said. “This science can help us dissolve the illusion of who we think we are.”</p>\n<p>Smart, who graduated from UCSB in 2003, said he began yoga to seek relief from a hectic career in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“My first passion in life was surfing, I was a semi-professional/professional surfer. And when I went off into the real world to get a job in the film industry… I wasn’t getting the same physical activity that I got through surfing,” Smart said. “So I first came to yoga to help me deal with working 12, 14, 18-hour days. It was the most strenuous job I could have dreamed of.”</p>\n<p>Smart said yoga helped bring calm to his life and inspired him to open his own studio.</p>\n<p>“That was a lot of stress for the body, mind, and spirit. So, trying to finding a balance there, I just had to have a personal practice,” Smart said. “That’s how I found yoga and a daily practice, to counterbalance that chaos,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said while he and the instructors have roots in Kundalini yoga, Yoga Isla Vista will offer many styles of yoga to best serve each individual.</p>\n<p>“We’re not just doing Kundalini, we’re doing all different types, because we believe that everybody has a different path. We just want to offer authentic forms of yoga; we’re not a corporate yoga, it’s not a gym workout,” Smart said. “We’re just offering a slice of different traditions, so the community and students within it can be exposed to it and gravitate towards whatever tradition they like.”</p>\n<p>According to Smart, Kundalini yoga helps individuals attain a flowing mindset rather than a fixed one, and encourages people to follow their intuitions.</p>\n<p>“To me, we can approach life in two ways. One is, ‘my way or the highway.’ The other is to surrender to the flow and that natural, tiny voice that’s saying ‘go this way, don’t go that way,’” Smart said. “That’s the voice we’re trying to listen to, that passionate, energetic guide.”</p>\n<p>Smart said his goal is to share the yogic tradition rather than control it, and encourages campus clubs to continue their activities.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to monopolize yoga; that’s totally against the tradition. The idea is that it spreads,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said he hopes the studio will impact I.V. in a positive, life-changing way.</p>\n<p>“The whole purpose was to give this community and college kids the tools they need for life … and there’s certain things that aren’t taught in school, unfortunately,” Smart said. “So that they have it in their tool kit, so they can live happier, healthier, holier lives — ‘holy’ meaning kind, loving, compassionate, realizing you’re part of a bigger whole and you’re grateful for that.”</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics and statistics major Caroline Cubero said yoga is a source of tranquility for her during stressful times, and the she wants to look into taking classes at the studio.</p>\n<p>“I did yoga over the summer, and it really calms me down. It helps me get all of my stress out and I feel so much better at the end of the day. Especially if I’m having a really bad day, it helps to reduce my stress. I definitely want to check it out,” Cubero said.</p>\n<p>Kundalini Yoga student Cy Cascade said setting aside inhibitions with an open mind is the first step to benefiting from yoga.</p>\n<p>“When you first come to class, you’re gonna be greeted by your teacher, who probably doesn’t look like a typical yoga teacher in the spandex or yoga pants,” Cascade said. “You have to let go of your preconceived notions that ‘this is weird’…you have to get past yourself. Which opens you up to being available to experience the amazing rewards.”</p>\n<p>Classes at Yoga Isla Vista will begin Monday, Nov. 2 with a special two-week student trial period for $25.</p><div

believe noise, drugs and alcohol are problems in Isla Vista. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Middle school and high school students convened Tuesday in Isla Vista, asking community leaders to acknowledge the need for a safe, peaceful community conducive to their busy schedules.</p>\n<p>About 35 teenage students from schools throughout Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of 200 I.V. residents indicating that Isla Vistans are overwhelmingly concerned about alcohol, drugs and noise in the community.</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the students split into groups and canvassed I.V., asking 200 residents — almost half of which were college students — what they found problematic in the area.</p>\n<p>Of the 200 residents surveyed, 88.5 percent said alcohol is a problem in I.V., 84 percent said drugs are a problem and 85 percent said noise is an issue on the weekends.</p>\n<p>“Some of my nights when I’m in Isla Vista doing my homework, it can be really noisy,” said one 15-year-old who presented some of the findings Tuesday. “I am a student, too.”</p>\n<p>Named “I’m a Student, Too!,” the event sought to remind UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that there are younger students in I.V. who attend middle schools and high schools in the county.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 200 residents surveyed, the students also asked 100 locals for their favorite thing about I.V., recording responses including the beach, the warm weather, Freebirds and the Children’s Park. Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V.

She said the noise is the most difficult part of living in I.V., adding that she often sees people smoking and drinking at a park near her house, although the problem is improving.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I’m not able to go outside to enjoy the park,” she said. “I hope it gets better. It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70477\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70477\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/teens-express-frustrations-of-living-in-isla-vista/","id":4607,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[4606,4605,4604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The meeting focused on whether or not the CSD should establish a tenant mediation program and, if it is established, what its specific design and functions should be. I.V. residents will vote in November of 2016 on whether or not to approve the formation of a CSD.</p>\n<p>According to Community Organizer from Assemblymember Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott, a tenant mediation program would be the simplest service to establish because it would not directly conflict with any state’s codes for CSDs.</p>\n<p>City of Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program representative Andrea Bifano, who sits on the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force for the potential CSD, describes mediation as a process that “empowers” disputing parties to reach a resolution.</p>\n<p>“A neutral third party helps facilitate communication by clarifying both the views and positions and helping the parties come up with their own solutions,” Vivano said. “Often times, people are in a situation or relationship that they need to continue, and if they don’t work out their dispute it could escalate and lead to conviction, which is something we would like to prevent.”</p>\n<p>Elliott said that the UCSB Community Housing Office is currently the only tenant mediation service for students living in I.V., and it is not available to non-student UCSB resident of I.V., such as Santa Barbara City College students.</p>\n<p>“They provide tenant mediation for all students, faculty and staff of UCSB. They handle 500 cases a year, 85 percent of those are people that reside in Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “A lot of SBCC students that live in I.V., a lot of non-student renters that live in I.V., they don’t have any sort of tenant mediation offered to them … This is why this service became one of our top priorities.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and fourth-year English and sociology double-major Clara Perez said IVTU advocates for tenants and empowers them to fight for their rights but does not provide mediation.</p>\n<p>“We have recently worked to fight with eviction cases,” Perez said. “We work to bring awareness to the community about how families and students are being treated by their landlords.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Downtown Business Association Vice President Jay Freeman said a CSD might not provide the power needed to run an effective tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, I think we’re kind of hamster-wheeling on some of these issues, because the form of government that we’ve been able to come up with and been able to construct doesn’t allow us to have the kinds of land use power that will allow us to have the kind of teeth that would actually allow us to force landlords to do anything,” Freeman said. “We need a city or a county to actually step in and do something.”</p>\n<p>Perez said IVTU could “be those teeth” by advocating for tenants if landlords do not cooperate.</p>\n<p>“We can’t necessarily get involved as far as the mediation goes, but if landlords are refusing to come to mediation tables, we want to know,” Perez said. “We want to know if anyone’s rights are being neglected so that we can have their back and put them on blast.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print

Courtesy of St. George</p></div>\n<p>Independent housing developer Ed St. George of St. George Associates introduced a proposal earlier this year to convert Beach City apartments on Cliff Drive into dorms for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students.</p>\n<p>St. George plans to renovate the two-story apartments by adding a third story to accommodate up to 1,500 SBCC students. Existing kitchens will be removed for more space, and a new shared dining commons will be added. The proposal is currently in the second pre-application process under the City of Santa Barbara Planning Division.</p>\n<p>Planning Division Project Planner Daniel Gullett said the Santa Barbara Planning Commission will review the early concept of the project.</p>\n<p>“The applicant will be submitting another pre-application in January because there are so many large issues to address,” Gullett said. “The applicant will get more feedback from city staff and then put together a formal application.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the Planning Commission is taking special caution with the proposal because the project is a new concept for the city.</p>\n<p>“It’s a unique project for the city. We don’t have any dormitories, and this particular project requires a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission,” Gullett said. “So there is a lot of discretion in the review. It would be the only dormitory in the city.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the application process may take years to approve because the project is unique to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“City council would have to approve the zone change and land use designation change to allow for the height, and Coastal Commission would have to certify,” Gullett said. “The design would also have to be approved by the Architectural Board of Review.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Elledge Planning and Permitting Services Principal Planner Laurel Perez said the firm is currently developing the second pre-application package, which they will submit in early January.</p>\n<p>“We’ve engaged traffic and parking consultants, a project biologist and project archeologist that will look at the cultural resources that might be present on site,” Perez said. “We’re completing those technical studies that will help address many of the questions that the city has identified in relationship to this project.”</p>\n<p>According to Perez, the project is still in its early stages and will continue to address concerns such as parking issues, noise and neighborhood compatibility.</p>\n<p>“Ed St. George’s primary objective for this project is to create a student environment that positively interacts with the local community,” Perez said. “Hopefully together we can come up with a project that addresses community concerns and help to meet a long overdue student housing need.”</p>\n<p>Perez said many other community colleges in the nation are facing similar housing issues because of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to learn that this is not a unique situation that SBCC is facing,” Perez said. “We are seeing an increase in the number of students who are attending a community college that provide excellent education.”</p>\n<p>According to SBCC President Lori Gaskin, less than 15 of the 113 colleges in the California Community College system have dormitories.</p>\n<p>“Dormitories are not funded by the state for community colleges and are not part of the mission,” Gaskin said. “Those [community colleges with dorms] tend to be in locations that are very remote or are servicing remote geographic regions.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said Beach City Apartments are close to campus but unaffiliated with the college.</p>\n<p>“It existed for a long time, but this particular developer bought it a couple of years ago and is seeking to increase the capacity of living apartments,” Gaskin said.<br>\nGaskin said the proposal might help with low vacancy rates and high rental fees in Santa Barbara, which have impacted student enrollment rates at SBCC since 2009.</p>\n<p>“This fall semester we are down in enrollment by over four percent. When we reached out to potential students on why they applied but chose not to enroll, they talked about the cost of living,” Gaskin said. “The cost of living competes with the cost of going to school, so it’s really hard on our students.”</p>\n<p>SBCC student and third-year communication major Allie Trice said it was easy for her to find housing in Isla Vista because she had friends from UCSB living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I chose to live here because all of my friends lived here since they went to UCSB. I didn’t really have any friends at SBCC,” Trice said. “It was convenient. It was nice already knowing people living here.”</p>\n<p>Trice said housing in I.V. and the Santa Barbara area is expensive because of its proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“When I first moved down here, I was like, ‘Wow. I’m paying for living in a double as much as you’d pay for a whole apartment where I’m from,’” Trice said. “I understand that it’s expensive because we live right down the street from the beach.”</p>\n<p>Trice said the proposal would be a convenient option for SBCC students struggling to find affordable housing near campus.</p>\n<p>“I would never personally do it because I like living [in I.V.],” Trice said. “But I know that would be a really good option for many students, because I know that at city college, there is a struggle to get housing there, and it’s expensive as well.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/","id":4609,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4608,4607,4606],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
