Everything is roses and bunny rabbits when the ball bounces their way, but the moment something goes awry, disinterest, disappointment and discontentment sets in. Professional sports teams ebb and flow, with some years being fantastic, and others not so swell. Even though the road becomes considerably tougher during the valley years of a team’s record, it is up to the athlete to adapt to the situation, and improve upon oneself to get to the peaks again.</p>\n<p>Randy Moss doesn’t realize this. Or, more accurately, does realize it, but chooses not to care. See, Moss believes that he is God’s gift to every franchise that is deemed lucky enough to have him. To him, in a perfect world, those that passed on his wondrous talents will feel God’s vengeance in the form of Moss scoring three touchdowns on them in a game. However, the problem here is Moss’ motivation to do so. He is, what I call, the “convenience player.” This means that he plays hard when he wants to play hard. He focuses only when that game is deemed worthy enough to gauge his interest. He outworks and outhustles his opponents only when he feels like he is “on.” Run the correct route when he is having an off game? Why bother? Moss works for Moss, and it is crazy to think otherwise.</p>\n<p>You would think with all the marijuana he presumably smokes that he would learn to relax, and just play his game. See, Moss has had a bit of an issue with the banned substance, stemming all the way back to his days with Notre Dame, I mean, Florida State, or rather, Marshall University. He collected misdemeanors and fines like Pokemon cards, and did not seem to learn his lesson in Minnesota when he allegedly ran into a police officer because she was in his way … when he was making an illegal turn … while high. To this day he has admitted that he smokes it “every blue moon.” Back to the main point here, instead of buckling down, and getting to work because he knows it will help the team, he instead chooses to go off on senseless diatribes about how he is misunderstood, and incorrectly used in offensive schemes. He doesn’t respect his teammates, his coaches, his executives and apparently, not even the caterers anymore. No one is safe from Moss’ blame game except himself.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For a guy who is seemingly so confident in himself, he sure does put a lot of weight on how others think of him. In one of his more “heartfelt” press conferences this season, he contended, “people don’t want to see me do good,” along with the fact that “he doesn’t feel appreciated.” He dwells on the fact that, doggone it, people just don’t like him!  Well, shucks, Randy, how could they not? Constantly chirping about the poor decisions of the coach, the quarterback and the organization is usually the way to win over a football town.  Even more recently, Moss decided to conduct his own interviews with himself, ala a CRAZY PERSON. Moss has grown tiresome in his older age, constantly fretting about his legacy, his salary and his level of “appreciativeness.” The fact remains that Randy Moss was unable to wrap his head around the “team concept” that the best of our world’s sports franchises are built upon. Where that leaves him now, we’ll soon find out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/speaces-pieces-randy-moss-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/speaces-pieces-randy-moss-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/speaces-pieces-randy-moss-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/speaces-pieces-randy-moss-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/speaces-pieces-randy-moss-suck/","id":2811,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2810,2809,2808],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace","biography":"Not available","articles":[913,919,1758,2136,2141,2148,2166,2213,2290,2297,2790,2811,2831,2870],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Flex Decisions for Flexible People","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In fantasy football, the most common dilemma for an owner is who to start in a given position week in and week out.

This means that while they certainly cannot earn you a win by themselves, they will also not hurt you so badly that you will lose because of them.</p>\n<p>I like to start running backs in the flex position. Unlike wide receivers (who can only earn you points if they receive a significant amount of targets from their quarterback), a starting running back, or even one who is in a time share with another back, is usually guaranteed around 15 touches per game. He may not have a huge day, but he will have the opportunity to earn you enough points to push your point total.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Seattle Seahawks’ running back Justin Forsett. Although officially designated as the team’s starting running back, Forsett has so far been sharing his job, first with Julius Jones, and now with Marshawn Lynch. Despite this unfortunate fact, Forsett has still been averaging just over 12 carries per game, which has translated to over 60 yards per game the last three weeks for an average of over seven fantasy points per week. While it’s not spectacular, it’s also not horrible, and if that yardage is accompanied by a touchdown — as it was in Forsett’s last game — it can mean another six points and a very respectable fantasy day.</p>\n<p>Another example is Chicago Bears’ RB Matt Forté, who despite playing in the pass-first offense of Mike Martz, has been able to average nearly 13 fantasy points per week on an average of fewer than 12 carries.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to start a wide receiver at the flex position, be sure to start someone who gets enough targets to be useful every week, no matter the matchup. Normally, this will end up being a receiver who plays out of the slot position, because quarterbacks trust those receivers to get them out of tight spots. Since every quarterback gets into trouble several times a game, slot receivers are usually targeted often enough to make up for the fact that they don’t get many yards.</p>\n<p>Patriots’ wide receiver Wes Welker is the quintessential flex receiver. Tom Brady trusts him to get open when he needs him to, and so looks his way often in a variety of situations. This trust has led to 33 receptions for Welker so far, setting him on pace for 106 by the end of the season. Because Welker gets targeted so often and has so many receptions, he can be counted on to provided solid fantasy numbers week after week, as can other receivers like him.</p>\n<p>The key to success at the flex position is consistency. While they may not get an enormous amount of touches per game, they get enough work that fantasy owners can hope for at least some points each week. Consistency is exactly what you want out of a flex player, as the flex position is for players who can be trusted to provide enough points to cover your big game players, who tend to be more boom or bust, on days when they, well… bust. Whether you choose to play a running back or a wide receiver, make sure you pick someone you trust not to drop the ball with the game on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick Up of the Week:</strong> While I’d like to recommend Deion Branch, I find it hard to tell people to pick up any Patriots player based off one good week that was probably due to Tom Brady’s tendency to spread the ball around. Instead, I’ll tell you to keep Branch in mind but focus on Detroit Lions’ quarterback Matthew Stafford. When he returns from injury after the Lions’ bye week, he’ll take over an offense that is powered by running back Jahvid Best and wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With his talent and those weapons at his disposal, Stafford could provide a good option for anyone struggling at the QB position. Stafford is still available in 77 percent of leagues, but I have a feeling that’s about to change.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Josh Greenberg flexes his muscles like the running backs and wide receivers at the flex position.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/","id":2808,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2807,2806,2805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Chargers – You Suck and Here’s Why","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After bashing the underachieving San Francisco 49ers a few weeks ago, I feel like it’s about time I show a little hate for our neighbors to the south.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After bashing the underachieving San Francisco 49ers a few weeks ago, I feel like it’s about time I show a little hate for our neighbors to the south.</p>\n<p>The San Diego Chargers, who went 13-3 last season, are now 2-4.

The Chargers currently have the #1 rated offense and the #1 rated defense, in terms of yardage per game. Seems weird, right? How can a 2-4 team have the best offense and best defense in the league?</p>\n<p>The answer is inconsistent play on the road and poor special teams. Special teams are like breathing. You take it for granted when it runs smoothly and only give it attention when it falters. Yet it is vital to your success.</p>\n<p>San Diego has allowed six non-offensive touchdowns this year — 42 out of 126 points the team has allowed. Furthermore, Chargers punter Mike Scifres has had three punts blocked. Before this season, Scifres had one punt blocked in 393 career attempts.</p>\n<p>This is why the Chargers’ defensive achievements may be skewed.</p>\n<p>Philip Rivers is a stud and Antonio Gates and Malcolm Floyd have played well, but football is a team sport. The Chargers — who made drastic offseason moves — lack many of the playmakers that have helped them overcome poor starts in years past. The squad cannot expect to come from behind to win the division every year, especially with key players missing.</p>\n<p>On defense, the San Diego aggressive and blitzing scheme of years past is all but dead. With linebacker Shawne Merriman, defensive tackle Jamal Williams and cornerback Antonio Cromartie gone, the San Diego defense is hurting. Here are the quarterbacks that have beaten the Bolts this season: Matt Cassel,  Matt Hasselbeck, Jason Campbell and Sam Bradford.</p>\n<p>When you play against young, inexperienced or mistake-prone quarterbacks, it is thought that you should move around on defense to show them various looks and eventually they will make a mistake. But the Bolts have been unable to disrupt quarterbacks. They will need to do so in the coming weeks when they face the likes of Tom Brady, Matt Schaub and Peyton Manning if they hope to turn this season around.</p>\n<p>All of this puts more pressure on the offense — a.k.a. Philip Rivers — to dominate. And he has. The offense has actually been great, but only because of great play from a few players. Football is a team sport, where a single weak link in the chain can be identified and exploited. The group is not without fault.</p>\n<p>Rivers was sacked a career-high seven times against the Rams, a team that had 10 sacks coming into the game and finished 30th in the league last year. Additionally, the Chargers have lost nine fumbles, a league-high and already two more than all of last season. The over-hyped Ryan Mathews has two of those fumbles. It’s safe to say the Bolts are missing LT right about now, and that LT — who is seventh in the league in rushing for the 5-1 Jets — is not missing them.</p>\n<p>In Week 5, the Chargers lost on the road to Oakland, snapping the 13-game winning streak San Diego had over the Raiders spanning over seven seasons. Oakland? Oakland!? Please type in “We Lost to Oakland” on YouTube. That about sums up San Diego’s season thus far.</p>\n<p>Much like the 49ers, one big thing the Chargers do have going for them is a weak division. It remains to be seen if the division-leading Chiefs are for real, and the Raiders and Broncos are not intimidating, let alone experienced.</p>\n<p>So if history tells us anything, it would be foolish for me to bet on the Chargers to win the division. Ultimately, the NFL is a quarterback-driven league, and San Diego has one of the best in the business. While Philip Rivers is very capable of leading his team to another division, it won’t happen this year. History also tells us that it is extremely difficult to dominate a division for this long, and this may be the year the Chargers falter.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Ryan Porush gets off to a

York City, where they won the Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row<em>. Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Model United Nations (MUN) won an Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row while representing Kuwait and Luxembourg at the National Model U.N. conference in New York last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The 22 members of UCSB MUN spent a little over one academic quarter preparing for the conference, at which they were split into pairs to represent a specific country, sit on various committees with different aims and write up legislation to combat various issues. A majority of the team represented Kuwait, and one pair represented Luxembourg in the Security Council. Over 150 schools and nearly 3,000 people attended the event, which took place from March 29 to April 2.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science and economics double major Jesse Lin said pairs worked together and used current events and the political history of their country to debate and write legislation to resolve present-day issues.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we try to come up with a resolution to solve these problems that the U.N. is facing currently in each of these committees,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and MUN delegate Benjamin Pu, the Outstanding Delegation award is only given to the top ten percent of participating schools.</p>\n<p>“This is our second year in a row winning it so we’re now established as a good model U.N. school,” Pu said. “If you win once at nationals it might be a fluke, but when you win twice in a row it’s definitely a powerhouse school.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Zeina Rousan said leadership skills shown by individuals on the team greatly contributed to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>“Almost every single person on the team was able to lead a working group; that’s probably why we ended up winning outstanding,” Rousan said. “We each practiced so much, knew so much information about these topics and were trained to be good diplomats that we were able to take all these people competing with us and have them want to work with us and have us lead in writing these resolutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, receiving outstanding delegation was a great accomplishment for the team and reflected the team’s hard work despite the large number of new members.</p>\n<p>“This year with a bigger team it’s really hard to manage, but everyone really tried,” Lin said. “Everyone worked really hard and researched a lot. There was a lot of outside research that they needed to do, and we ended up doing really well even though we had a lot of first-years who hadn’t done this before.”</p>\n<p>According to Pu, many of the members of the team also received individual recognition at the conference.</p>\n<p>“A couple of us took home position paper awards, and a couple of us took home delegate awards for doing the best in committee as well,” Pu said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Paul Krausse said visiting the United Nations headquarters was a memorable experience.</p>\n<p>“As a fourth-year but just a first-year in Model U.N., I felt somewhat intimidated by it but it was really great; we got to go to the U.N. headquarters in New York and that was an incredible experience, walking into Grand Hall was unbelievable,” Krausse said. “For anyone who was in Model U.N. it’s kind of like going to the holy grail of the U.N. That was such an incredible experience.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, a big part of the conference involved networking with people from all over the world and having their legislations recognized.</p>\n<p>“You get to meet a lot of new people in these conferences. You’re not only working together — you’re making friends,” Lin said. “At the end of the day you get to see your work posted on the website, and it makes you feel like you’ve really done something to mitigate these problems.”</p>\n<p>Krausse said faculty advisor for UCSB MUN Galen Stocking contributed greatly to the team, and recently moved to a new position at the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. after working with MUN for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“Galen’s contributions to the UCSB Model U.N. team are unbelievable, and I don’t know where UCSB Model U.N. would be without him,” Krausse said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-10/ucsb-mun-wins-award-for-second-year/","id":2810,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2809,2808,2807],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
