Food Security Committee, said the Free SB campaign set its sights specifically on the cultivation tax because of its “reliability”; due to the recency of legalized marijuana, Moon said, the tax is unlikely to go anywhere for some time, which the campaign flagged as a good marker for consistent funds.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultivation tax first arrived in California in January 2018, when the state deemed that “harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax … [and] applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/l519.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA.)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, according to the CDTFA, is set at $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of marijuana flower and $2.75 per dry-weight of marijuana leaves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is also a popular product among local growers — over “a third of all cultivation licenses issued in California to date are held in Santa Barbara County,” according to a </span><a href=\"https://sd19.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-24-jackson-issues-statement-cannabis-trailer-bill-vote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the </span><a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/local/santa-barbara-county-cannabis-tax-revenues-yet-to-materialize/article_13df5cb0-6165-506a-aee4-6787a650a187.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Maria Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Barbara County could earn between $4 and $64 million in tax revenue per year. According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We can say, ‘This experience happened to me. I felt unsafe. Can you explain to me why it happened or can we talk about this to work it through?’” Meijer said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others who joined Meijer included leaders of community and campus groups including Students Against Sexual Assault, the Isla Vista Community Services District, the Black Students Union and Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA-elect for the 2019-2020 school year. Members of the EVPLA office were also present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No law enforcement representatives attended this meeting. Meijer said it was due to the meeting’s preliminary nature in setting up a base and not conducting any official business yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preliminary draft of the agenda for meetings has introductions and guidelines for 10 minutes, public comment for 30 minutes, discussion for 30 minutes, identifying steps for 10 minutes and closed session without police officers for 10 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer based the new Police Collaborative Board’s structure off of an original police collaborative board proposal left behind by 2015-2016 EVPLA Paola Dela Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those present at the meeting suggested edits to the list of potential members of the board, such as law enforcement officers, A.S. entities and property owners. Changes were also made to the sample agenda, along with the goals and structure of meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasizing restorative justice and community policing as goals for the board was among the recommended changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara initially had a “Student Safety Panel” headed by former Lieutenant Raymond Vuillemainroy of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), according to the original proposal from Dela Cruz. The purpose of the panel was to create a collaborative relationship with community members and student leaders through open dialogue, but it was dissolved in 2013 when Lt. Vuillemainroy left the IVFP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was substantial debate on whether the presence of police officers was necessary during public comment for future meetings. While safety was considered imperative for community members who cited personal experiences and grievances with police officers, Meijer found it equally important for police officers to be present to listen to safety concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees settled on a compromise: People will be able to speak at meetings or submit written anonymous comments on paper or through a Google Form. People can also choose to comment privately later in the meeting without the presence of police officers in a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A suggestion was made for the addition of a statement at the beginning of meetings stating police officers will not question people regarding their comments unless there is a present danger to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising and translating in other languages so that community members of different linguistic backgrounds can voice their concerns was proposed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Meijer is working to have the Police Collaborative Board added to A.S. Legal Code. The board would have to be voted and approved through A.S. Senate, according to Meijer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A finalized version of the proposal will be considered at the next collaborative board meeting on May 29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer hopes to have the structure prepared so the board is ready to begin official business by Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy, believes the board will be able to foster a better relationship between the community and law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the board’s goal is to make an open line of communication… I think that’s a good thing. Student groups can raise concerns about things that are going on. We can answer those concerns in real-time, real-worded answers,” Schroeder said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

This is especially concerning in the university environment, which is supposed to be a place of open, unimpeded exchange of ideas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tanner has been with the university since Fall Quarter 2013, according to student verification records. She earned a masters in feminist studies at UCSB in 2015 and has since served as a teaching assistant for several courses within the department. </span></p>\n<p>According to Tanner’s <a href=\"http://www.lauratanner.net/about/\">website</a>, her doctoral research is focused around “the mistaken idea that biological sex is socially constructed or possible to change” and “the abusive and dangerously experimental practices of medically “transing” children and young adults.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university could not discuss specific incidents because of confidentiality requirements but said that UCSB will review any reports of campus policy violations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to comment on any potential complaints against Tanner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of some tweets visible on Tanner’s account, posted between January and June: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 20: “People who think they are transgender exist. No debate. There is no such thing as actually being transgender (a male woman or a female man). Believing so is a delusion. I will not validate such a decision by validating terms like ‘trans people’ Interpret that as you will.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 5: “Yea, like ‘woman’ ‘female,’ ‘man’ &amp; ‘male?’ These words all have original definitions based on reality. Transsexualism started this mess by trying to change ‘man/woman’ to include people of the opposite sex &amp; fantaszing that drugs &amp; cutting change one’s sex in the first place.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 29: “Rather than resolving dysphoria or dysmorphia, ‘transition’ maintains &amp; reinforces a state of opposition to one’s own body and forces one to live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance. This is not mental health care. #StopTransingKids #TruthisNotAHateCrime” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling males women, or females men is the very definition of misgendering </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel deeply disrespected by the notion that any male can call themselves a woman and be considered the same gender as me. #MalePrivilge #TransWomenAreMen #TruthIsNotAHateCrime”  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “If you ever had a dick you aren’t a lesbian, not now, not ever.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 26: “Genital cutting of any kind does not change one’s sex and can never make a man into a woman.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 14: “Trans ‘women’ are men, ffs”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2: “Stand up for your son because he is perfect the way he was born – a boy. No child is trans. It’s not possible to be born in the wrong body.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feb. 4: “People who believe themselves to be trans exist. Transgenderism itself is a delusion. A man cannot become a woman anymore than a male can become female. This is NOT a denial of the humanity of people who believe the delusion, it IS reality</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript

To the students who have been harmed by transphobia and anti-sex worker rhetoric in our department, we are so sorry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither letter mentions Tanner directly, both letters were released shortly after Tanner faced backlash on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two second-year UCSB students, Kyremina Youssef and Ari Moini, saw Tanner’s posts on Twitter and decided to organize the June 13 demonstration to make the greater student body aware of Tanner’s social media posts. The demonstration echoed the themes of the two open letters: that those who hold transphobic beliefs should not be allowed to teach at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moini said she believes it is “unsafe for the trans community on campus” for Tanner to teach at the school, and Youssef added that the two would hold additional rallies if Tanner continued teaching in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that while she knows Tanner is “protected by her First Amendment on Twitter,” the students are “also showing our First Amendment [rights] on campus by advocating for our community here and spreading awareness.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
