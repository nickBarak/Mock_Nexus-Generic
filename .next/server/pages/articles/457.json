Meanwhile, Riverside falls to 9-10 and 2-3 in league, having won only one game on the road.</p>\n<p>It was a trio of juniors that got the job done for UCSB. Along with Brewe, guard John Green also scored a career-high in points with 21, adding nine rebounds. Guard Michael Bryson, after scoring no points the previous game, came out shooting to start and finished with 16 points on 7-12 from the field.</p>\n<p>“I thought our junior class was excellent. They competed, made plays, made shots,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They played with aggression, they went after rebounds. They played the way they were capable of playing, which was really good to see.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 51 percent for the game, primarily because the Gauchos made an emphasis on scoring in the low post, punishing the Highlanders 32-18 in the paint. UCR was tied with the Gauchos going into halftime, in large part because of its eight threes made from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, the hot shooting did not translate into the second half for the Highlanders, while UCSB remained aggressive for the duration of the game.</p>\n<p>“We challenged them well before Al went down, that they have to be more assertive than they were last week,” Coach Williams said. “I’m happiest about how we came out and competed. We played more aggressive, we went at the rim, we did things you got to do in a basketball game.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was a major advantage for the Gauchos. Although not apparent on the stat sheet, senior guard Zalmico Harmon had a standout performance, delivering the ball to the right man and orchestrating the offense for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Eric Childress again proved to be a valuable asset off the bench; his eight rebounds were a career-high and his eight points were the most he has scored so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Seeing [Childress get eight rebounds] just tells you how aggressive he was offensively and defensively,” Bryson said. “He read the passing lanes and played a great game.”</p>\n<p>For UC Riverside, junior guard Jaylen Bland led the team with 21 points and senior guard Austin Quick gave the Highlanders a lift off the bench, going 4-7 from the field to finish with 13 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now waits until Saturday to play Cal State Fullerton at home. Tip-off is set for 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60060\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/mens-basketball-rolls-past-ucr-without-big-al/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60060\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/mens-basketball-rolls-past-ucr-without-big-al/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/mens-basketball-rolls-past-ucr-without-big-al/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/mens-basketball-rolls-past-ucr-without-big-al/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/mens-basketball-rolls-past-ucr-without-big-al/","id":457,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[456,455,454],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The man had difficulty maintaining balance, and at one point he fell onto the passenger side of a parked vehicle.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A Knight in Shining Uniform<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 16, 11:15 p.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed an 18-year-old man staggering west down the street.</p>\n<p>The man had difficulty maintaining balance, and at one point he fell onto the passenger side of a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p>An officer followed the man to catch up with him. The subject almost fell to ground several times before the officer had reached him, and people walking near him had to move out of the way to avoid being bumped.</p>\n<p>The deputy approached the man and grabbed his arm. The subject looked at the officer with his big bloodshot, watery eyes and pleaded to the officer, “Take care of me.”</p>\n<p>The officer easily determined that the man was drunk, and arrested him for public intoxication. The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Kicking and Screaming… and Crying<br>\nThursday, Sept. 22, 2:03 a.m. – Officers were alerted to a belligerent 21-year-old man when a cab driver dropped him off at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station after he refused pay a $100 cab fee.</p>\n<p>While the deputy was talking to the driver, the subject stood to the side, yelling that he refused to pay the fare.</p>\n<p>The officer contacted the subject, who smelled like booze and had vomit on his shirt and pants. The subject was oblivious to the officer, and continued yelling at the driver.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to question the man and asked him where he lived. In a moment of astounding maturity, the man responded, “I’m not telling you,” and started walking away from the cab.</p>\n<p>The deputy decided the man was too intoxicated to care for his safety or the safety of others, and arrested him for public intoxication. When the officer questioned the subject to prepare him for booking, the man was uncooperative and initially refused to answer questions.</p>\n<p>The subject then began crying, and said he just wanted to go home.</p>\n<p>While returning the man to his mommy may have been just what the subject needed, the officer decided he should take a short time out – in jail.</p>\n<p>As he was transported to the holding cell, the man began kicking the back seat of the vehicle and said, “I didn’t drive! I was just trying to get a free ride…”</p>\n<p>The man was placed in a solitary safety cell in the Santa Barbara County Jail, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Just Chillax, Mr. Officer<br>\nSunday, Sept. 24, 1:45 a.m. – Officers were dispatched to the 6500 block of El Colegio Road after receiving reports that a belligerent man was hitting apartment windows and trying to fight people.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived at the scene, several people in the courtyard of the apartment complex pointed to the 20-year-old man who was disturbing the neighbors.</p>\n<p>A few drinks were not the only thing the man had pounded that night, as the officer observed him beating on someone’s front door.</p>\n<p>The officer restrained the man and escorted him away from the apartment. While doing so, the officer noticed the man’s balance was unsteady and he reeked of alcohol.</p>\n<p>The deputy informed the man he was under arrest, and the subject told the officer, “It’s cool, homie.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication, and he was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was booked, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 30, 1:04 a.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw two 17-year-old women stagger westbound down the street.</p>\n<p>One woman was making it down the street by bouncing off every three or four cars as the other subject was practically carried by a doting gentleman.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the trashed trio and placed the car hopper on the curb for her safety. He began questioning the seemingly caring couple, but to everyone’s surprise – including the drunken duo’s – the pair did not know each other.</p>\n<p>The officer sent the man away, and attempted to find out where the girls were planning to stay for the night.

The Matadors are 11-11 and 4-4, making them fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s trio of consecutive wins began with its 75-61 victory over UCSB in the two teams’ first meeting on Jan. 25.</p>\n<p>UCSB will hope to avoid a season sweep against CSUN, which last happened in the 2014-15 season. In order to do so, the Gauchos will look to overcome their worst shooting performance in a conference game this season in their loss to UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara shot 31 percent from the field on 18-for-58 shooting and finished with a 12.5 three-point percentage on 2-for-16 perimeter shooting.</p>\n<p>In three of its last four games, excluding its program-record of 15 made three-pointers, UCSB has experienced a decline from beyond the arc. During the span of games, Santa Barbara has shot 30 percent or below from behind the three-point line on 13-for-56 shooting.</p>\n<p>“We went back a couple games with the guards, [and] looked at all of our makes and attempts,” Henrickson said. “[We] just looked at footwork. The message wasn’t to discourage them from shooting, but to encourage footwork, to be shot ready.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to regain consistency in perimeter shooting is redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter. She finished with zero points on 0-for-8 overall, 0-for-5 three-point shooting in the team’s recent loss.</p>\n<p>Yet, her scoreless performance isn’t too discouraging, as Porter has displayed her sharpshooting from long range all season, and currently ranks both third and fourth in total three-pointers made and three-point percentage in the Big West at 48 and 40.3 percent, respectively. She remains one of the team’s top scorers, emerging during conference play for an 11.4 points-per-game average.</p>\n<p>Despite her scoreless performance, it can be expected that Porter will look to establish her shooter’s touch early, and she could be the team’s difference maker after sitting out the Gauchos’ first matchup against the Matadors due to a shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>“We ended up playing four guards [in the first meeting]. Obviously, we missed her that day because she does a lot of really good things for her,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “She’s gotta pressure the ball on the perimeter, be aggressive offensively, get some offensive rebounds, get to the free-throw line and be a big athletic guard in this league. She’s a big part of who we are, but there are no excuses. We’re a team sport, somebody else has the opportunity to step up, but we didn’t really have anybody take advantage of the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>While Porter provides an “athletic big” presence, the speed and downhill play of both of UCSB’s point guards in senior Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior Drea Toler is the focal point to the team’s operation.</p>\n<p>Currently averaging a career-high of nine points per game, Jemerigbe’s most significant improvement has been her shooting. Specifically, she has thrived from behind the three-point line as she leads the Big West in three-point percentage with a 47.1 average.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Toler has been UCSB’s sparkplug off the bench and has been most impactful during Big West play. After averaging 9.2 ppg during the non-conference schedule, Toler is now just behind Porter for the team lead in conference games with 11.2 ppg.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has managed to outdo opponents with its scoring and three-point shooting, UCSB’s ability to improve its on-ball defense will be most important tonight as it prepares to face a Matador team that can produce both inside the paint and along the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Presenting a problem for the Gauchos’ defense in the first meeting was the shooting of redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe. She scored a career-high 28 points and finished the game 10-for-21 from the field, 3-for-8 from downtown. Finishing eighth in the Big West with a 34.6 three-point percentage last season, Maulupe is on pace once again for a top-10 spot with a current 37.9 long range percentage that ranks sixth.</p>\n<p>Aiding Maulupe off the bench was sophomore guard Cheyenne Allen with a career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>Yet, the biggest concern for the Gauchos is finding a way to contain CSUN’s primary force of sophomore center Channon Fluker.</p>\n<p>She became just the second player ever in CSUN’s Division I history to record a 20-20 game with 22 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in the team’s win over Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the only current Big West player to average a double-double — 15.8 ppg and a league-leading 11.4 rebounds per game, respectively — Fluker’s talents have placed her alongside some of the nation’s best frontcourt players.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ post star is sixth in rebounds per game, tied for seventh in double-doubles with 14, eighth in total rebounds with 251, 24th in both total blocks and blocks per game with 54 and a 2.45 average, respectively.</p>\n<p>“[Fluker] is everybody’s primary concern defensively, but where they got us [in the first meeting] was inside-outside. They scored on the perimeter and didn’t have to go to her right away. They had great pace offensively, really stretched the defense,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Fluker recorded a career-high seven blocks in Northridge’s victory over UCSB earlier this season. She also tallied 11 rebounds, which contributed to the Matadors outrebounding the Gauchos 47-27.</p>\n<p>Pivotal to UCSB’s attempt to contain the Matadors will be its ability to take away one of the Matadors’ assets and not allow them to control both the interior and perimeter.</p>\n<p>UCSB and CSUN tips off tonight at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75585\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75585\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-aims-to-take-down-streaking-csun-at-home/","id":455,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[454,453,452],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big Al Out Indefinitely, UCSB Hosts Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Already 1-2 in Big West, men's basketball has the difficult task of playing without its leading scorer, Alan Williams, this week.

Now with no Big Al whatsoever, a total team effort will be needed to fend off a dangerous UCR team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We should have been better able to handle [Big Al] being under the weather,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Now we will find out if we can flat play without him because we will not even have a [sick] Al Williams, we will have no Al Williams.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is 8-9 overall and 1-2 in conference after suffering a road loss at Long Beach State. In that game, UCSB shot a miserable 25 percent from the field and at one point, missed 25 of 27 attempts. Already having suffered a loss to Cal State Northridge two days before, consecutive losses place the Gauchos in seventh place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Riverside comes in 9-9 overall and 2-2 in league after last week’s split at home, fourth in league.</p>\n<p>To make up for Big Al’s spot in the starting lineup, junior forward Sam Beeler will start in place along with junior guard John Green, while junior forward Mitch Brewe will be relegated to the bench. UCSB will need to count on Green, freshman Gabe Vincent and junior guard Michael Bryson — the team’s shooters — to provide the offense Williams normally provides.</p>\n<p>“We will run only things that we feel benefit that group,” Coach Williams said. “A lot of stuff we run and plays we run, are built around playing for Al, and so now we’re not going to have Al so, it opens up more room for others to penetrate. We’re going to have to hit jump shots no doubt.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB to pick things up offensively, Bryson will have to shake off his performance from his two previous games. It was Bryson who catapulted the Gauchos to a win in their conference opener against Cal Poly, but versus CSUN and Long Beach, he combined for a total of eight points, not scoring at all against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of the guys we’re challenging,” Coach Williams said. “There are a lot of options for him to get involved. Number one thing is you play harder, be more aggressive, make more things happen.”</p>\n<p>Bryson could get the hot hand this weekend as UCR is ranked fifth in the Big West in points allowed.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders will counter with junior forward Taylor Johns, who is second in the league in rebounds with 8.4. Johns is a player quick off the bounce and has expanded his game with a perimeter shot. He could be a problem for Green and Brewe because of his quickness.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/","id":456,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[455,454,453],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
