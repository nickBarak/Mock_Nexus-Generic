St. George &amp; Associates plans to terminate the Ambassador Program starting next year and may convert it to a scholarship program where students will no longer be able to choose which service events to participate in.</p>\n<p>St. George &amp; Associates owner Ed St. George said he is ending the current Ambassador Program to prevent further dispute with tenants over the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to fight with people anymore,” St. George said. “I’m terminating what I think was probably one of the most innovative community programs that you could put in a college community.”</p>\n<p>In order to prevent further complications, St. George said he plans to change the Ambassador Program to a scholarship program where students no longer choose their own community service activities.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do a scholarship program next year and I’m not letting kids pick the events anymore — it’s not going to happen,” St. George said. “They broke my heart this year.”</p>\n<p>Ambassador Program director Mark Capritto said residents avoided the proper types of events for the program, which asked tenants to perform community service.<br>\n“[The residents] didn’t do what they were told,” Capritto said. “You can’t just pick and choose what you want to do — you do the program.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates would often turn down the reward for tenants who did activities like donating blood or working on campus, which he felt did not directly help the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Some people were saying, ‘Well I gave blood. That should help somebody in Isla Vista.’ We said, ‘No you can’t count that.’ People started doing all these things that they felt were contributing, and — bless their hearts — that’s what they do,” Capritto said. “Certainly donating blood is a worthy prospect, but it didn’t meet the needs of those people who were actually paying to have it done.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said he supports the idea of converting the Ambassador Program into a scholarship program, but maintained he is opposed to terminating the program altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really want to walk away from this,” Capritto said. “Ed [St. George] asked me a year ago to come in and look after it, and I said I would.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Legal Resource Center attorney Robin Unander said tenants asked for attorney service as early as October when disputes arose between residents and St. George &amp; Associates over how many hours were required for each community service event and what kinds of service activities qualified under the program.</p>\n<p>“There was such a firestorm of frustration that some tenants had to lawyer up and try to see what they could do to try and get [St. George &amp; Associates] to comply,” Unander said. “One student lawyered up last October.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates has made it difficult for students to adhere to the community service requirement of the program. She said the property management company kept “moving the carrot,” and students found themselves having to complete additional requirements to receive their reward.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much of a shit-storm going on over there with students who rightfully complied with their contractual obligations,” Unander said. “They jumped through the hoops that they were told they had to jump through, but the hoops kept moving.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates changed the qualifications to avoid paying for the 20 percent difference created by the rent discounts, which she said cost the company more expenses than it anticipated.</p>\n<p>“I think the Ambassador Program ended up being more expensive than what they originally estimated,” Unander said. “They probably had more tenants qualify for it than what they thought would, so then that became an expensive experiment.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Capritto has no legal authority to change the language of the program because the program’s specifications are bound within the lease contract.</p>\n<p>“The Ambassador Program is incorporated into the lease contract, so they have to honor it just like they have to honor every single clause contained within that contract,” Unander said. “The sad part is that whoever this Mark Capritto person is, he’s lacking the knowledge about contract law.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said the attorneys who argue that St. George &amp; Associates cannot change the language of the Ambassador Program hold a different view on the function of the rental organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m not an attorney, but what I can tell you is that is coming from an attorney who’s protecting their client,” Capritto said. “I know where the attorneys are coming from, but that’s their interpretation of what an organization does.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates is allowed to alter the Ambassador Program at any time it wants as part of its rights as an organization.<br>\n“We’re an organization,” Capritto said. “We reserve the right to restructure ourselves.”</p>\n<p>A Campus 880 resident and second-year student who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Ambassador Program required she complete 16 hours of community service per year upon signing her lease, but that number has now increased to 64 hours per year. She said she fears she may not obtain the minimum amount of hours because the number has increased and St. George &amp; Associates limited what events she could participate in.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t let us choose our own volunteer work in Isla Vista,” the tenant said in an email. “It makes it more difficult to accumulate hours, and we can’t pursue volunteer work in the areas of our choosing, like we used to be able to.”</p>\n<p>The tenant also said St. George &amp; Associates was imbalanced by giving credit to residents who did not properly complete their community service.</p>\n<p>“Some students who didn’t complete the volunteer hours simply got their hours signed off by a Campus 880 representative, and they were told they could ‘make up the hours later,’” the tenant said in an email. “This is unfair as this option wasn’t available to all students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the February 19, 2015 print version of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

The campaign calls for the Abrego Villas property manager Majestic Asset Management, LLC to abide by Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, stating landlords must provide relocation funds to tenants if five or more are evicted within 90 days of each other. The evicted tenants, most of who are low income Latino families, have filed a small claims lawsuit with a hearing scheduled for early March, and officials with IVTU and the Associated Students Legal Resource Center estimate the tenants are entitled to up to $10,500 each in county benefits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60969\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60969\" data-attachment-id=\"60969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60969\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8-684x1024.jpg?resize=268%2C401\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"268\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-8.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>During the event, protesters made beaded bracelets with words like “justice” and “tenants” on them and the IVTU distributed free IVTU shirts and sandwiches. Protesters then marched the streets and chanted slogans including “Tenants United, Will Never Be Divided!” and “Fight! Fight! Fight! Housing Is A Right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major and IVTU Development Director Alejandro Sanchez said the tenants union organized the demonstration in order to bring attention to an issue that he said effects all residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Some people might think that we’re just here for the six families, but that’s not necessarily true,” Sanchez said. “The six families are part of the community and as a whole were just trying to help them out. At the end of the day, it’s not just for them. It’s for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, who attended the march, said the evictions at Abrego Villas are the latest in a history of similar housing issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been doing it for years now and it’s not a new thing, evicting people,” Minoiefar said. “It reflects how the landlords here feel that they can do whatever they want — in terms of rent, in terms of upkeep, everything. Housing issues here are ridiculous. And this is just one of the worst ways in which they abuse their power.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology and political science double major Cameron Schunk said outside management companies need to recognize I.V. is not a “lawless” area where tenants’ rights violations can go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>“Where I come from, if people next door were evicted en mass, there would be uproar and there would be protest,” Schunk said. “We’re coming together and saying, ‘Not in our community … You cannot just come here and take advantage of renters. That’s not how it works.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60966\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60966\" data-attachment-id=\"60966\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60966\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5-684x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C599\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Schunk, student and I.V. resident participation in demonstrations is vital to bringing the evicted tenant situation to justice.</p>\n<p>“Exposing the fact that these things are happening is paramount,” Schunk said. “As well as gathering community interest to fight these occurrences in the future.

Clinic for the weekly I.V. self-governance meeting organized by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>This week, attendees discussed whether to create a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) instead of or in addition to a Community Services District (CSD). Discussions at previous self-governance meetings had been primarily focused on forming a CSD, but it is still unclear exactly what form of self-governance will be proposed by Williams’ Assembly Bill 3, which aims to create self-government in I.V. in order to provide infrastructure and services to I.V. residents. The group also discussed efforts to understand the demographics and needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a member of  Williams’ district office staff, said the creation of a CSD requires more discussion time because it is more complicated than the creation of a MAC.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about the CSD option so in-depth because it’s so complicated and covers so many areas,” Elliott said. “We’re going to talk about Municipal Advisor Councils today, which is an alternative to the CSD. I.V. had one in the 70’s and 80’s that was dissolved, so we’re talking about maybe bringing that back.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, cityhood discussions cannot begin until organizers have a better idea of I.V.’s potential financial situation.</p>\n<p>“The cityhood plan we can’t really talk about until we find out if it’s financially feasible,” Elliott said. “The CSD is so complicated and has so many layers we’ve been focusing our meetings on that.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and local business owner Jay Freeman said it was not made clear at the meeting whether an I.V. CSD would be feasible.</p>\n<p>“It’s not actually clear that a CSD itself is financially feasible,” Freeman said. “I only say that because I take some issue with the notion that cityhood cannot be discussed because we don’t know whether it’s financially feasible but there’s a base assumption that a CSD can be discussed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar however said stakeholders should not be content to create only a MAC.</p>\n<p>“I think that the MAC is a great thing for us to be able to utilize, due to the fact that a CSD would take about 16 months for it to be formed,” Minoiefar said. “However, I wouldn’t want the momentum, the political feasibility that we have right now to be spent only on a MAC. This is our chance to do something very big, like institute a very strong institution that can be here for decades to come because it’s self-sustaining.”</p>\n<p>Longtime resident Sue Dixon said she is concerned that there would not be adequate funding and support with a MAC.</p>\n<p>“It had been more than 10 years since we had a disaster and support for Isla Vista just died as part of that cycle. We get another disaster and people start pouring resources back and we’ve seen this happen,” Dixon said. “This is why I think we should have permanent funding for a MAC. I think a MAC is a great idea. I would like to see permanent funding because I don’t trust the county to keep going with it.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said the both MAC and the CSD could be created.</p>\n<p>“I don’t view these two things as mutually exclusive and I hope no one in this room does,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District board member Pegeen Soutar said a MAC was established in 1972 because of the unrest in I.V. and founded many of the current institutions in I.V., including IVRPD and IVFP.</p>\n<p>“It was actually pretty huge at the time,” Soutar said. “I.V. Parks and Rec actually came out of a combination of the Community Council and the MAC. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the idea of the Foot Patrol, came out of the MAC. The Isla Vista Health Clinic came out of the MAC. These are all institutions that still exist that came from this beginning seed of people coming together.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Trustee Jonathan Abboud said he is working to put out a survey of I.V. residents on how they would like potential tax dollars be spent in I.V., as well as the possibility of performing a census in I.V.</p>\n<p>“People don’t know the exact technicalities, but they understand the taxes pretty well,” Abboud said. “They knew that they needed more money if they wanted these services. Parking and lighting was overwhelmingly what people would put their money towards. We were thinking of doing a census that would be going door to door and asking ‘How many people live in your apartment?’”</p>\n<p>Spatial Arts Professor Kim Yasuda said she would be willing to survey university faculty living in the faculty housing units adjacent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Has anyone gone over to faculty housing and canvased them?” Yasuda said. “That’s a tax-paying base. I think we could get permission to get on the list serve or something … That’s 65 units of probably 200 people.”</p>\n<p>The stakeholders created a preliminary list of broad, amendable goals for a CSD to add to the AB 3 language so that the bill can continue forward in the legislature. The list includes the creation of a MAC, a tenant mediation program, a parking program and the building of community facilities. The tentative list of goals will be discussed further at next week’s meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/","id":4771,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4770,4769,4768],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 16-18","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) officers responded to numerous calls in I.V. last weekend, citing under-aged students for possession of cocaine, taking custody of three legally registered firearms for s...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) officers responded to numerous calls in I.V. last weekend, citing under-aged students for possession of cocaine, taking custody of three legally registered firearms for safekeeping and answering calls related to battery, public intoxication, driving under the influence and prowling.</p>\n<p>Units were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road Monday night to respond to a noise complaint made by student Michael B regarding his roommate. Seconds after units cleared the call, the roommate flagged down the IVFP officers in the street and stated that Michael B was brandishing a knife. After investigation, Michael B was arrested on a citizen’s arrest for brandishing a weapon and battery.</p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, officers also learned Michael B had two legally registered rifles, a modified AK-47 and a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun in the house, which Michael B agreed to turn over to the officers for safekeeping. In addition, the roommate agreed to turn over his gas pistol to the officers for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the AK-47 had been professionally modified to fit legal California firearm standards and not function as an assault rifle, which has been prohibited in California since the 1989 approval of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is that it fires single rounds at a time instead of automatic,” Plastino said. “It still fires a 7.62mm round, which is still the standard size round for an AK-47.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, because Michael B did not use the firearms in any act of violence nor give any indication that he would, he was not legally required to relinquish possession of his guns, although Plastino believes Michael B was correct to do so.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the guy made a good decision,” Plastino said. “He made a thoughtful decision in allowing us to take his weapons from him because he didn’t have to. He committed a sort of violent crime, brandishing a knife, so he needs to cool off and calm down before we’ll return his weapons to him.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle with four juveniles and one adult inside during a routine traffic stop because the headlights were turned off while the car was in motion. The driver, a juvenile, was under the influence of alcohol, while two more passengers were intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana with the other two passengers in possession of cocaine. All subjects were cited and their parents called to pick them up. The legal adult, 18-year-old Michael Davis, was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday night, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a female was approached and verbally assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Carrington Cox, outside of 7-11. When the victim’s current boyfriend stepped in to intervene, a shoving match ensued, at which point Cox struck the victim’s current boyfriend in the face with a skateboard. Cox then broke free of the scuffle and ran towards his ex-girlfriend, stomping on her left leg and fleeing south on El Embarcadero. The female victim sustained a fractured tibia and extensive knee injuries.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Delta Gamma sorority requested extra patrol in light of the social media shooting rumors, during which officers noticed Santa Barbara City College student Joshua McKenzie Smith at an upstairs, outside door of the sorority house. Plastino said Smith tried the door to see if it would open and claimed to be trying to find the residence of his friend, Tom. He was then arrested for public intoxication and prowling.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers also noted that on Sunday there were more crowds out than a usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, during which there were miscellaneous alcohol and noise ordinance citations issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/","id":4772,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4771,4770,4769],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
