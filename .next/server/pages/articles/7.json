So a little less traditional archiving for community archives,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force is working with Matt Stahl, the university archivist, on the COVID-19 archives project. Stahl said archives focus traditionally on documents like administrative records; while Stahl and Force plan to collect UCSB announcements and official documents related to the coronavirus pandemic, the focus for this project is to provide a community perspective of life during the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-digital aspect of the project adds a greater degree of access for the UCSB community, many of whom are scattered across the country, to safely participate in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a google form on the </span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-covid-19-community-archives-project-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University Library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website, interested participants can answer questions about their coronavirus stories –– where they are waiting out the pandemic, how they have been impacted and how the pandemic has changed their perspective on life — all while remaining anonymous.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions could be anything from YouTube videos about a day in the life during the coronavirus pandemic to photographs of an empty UCSB campus to personal blogs, but the possibilities for submissions are limitless, Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows for a safe place for self-expression and catharsis,” Force said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Force, the role of documenting UCSB history during the coronavirus pandemic goes beyond simply archiving — preserving the experiences of individuals during the pandemic is an essential piece to recovering and surviving it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re kind of acting as cultural heritage first responders. We’re responding to moments of tragedy and crisis in a different way than the frontline medical professionals do,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re offering a way to preserve people’s stories and truths, not only for evidentiary value but for self edification to capture historical moments at its most raw and unfiltered form.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl pointed to other examples of when UCSB archive projects were used as a response to community crises, like the</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/isla-vista-memorial-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isla Vista Memorial Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The COVID-19 archives project parallels the memorial project because both projects ask fundamental questions of “how are people dealing with trauma,” and “how does the UCSB community deal with trauma,” Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 archives project has been accepting submissions through its website since May 14, but there is no set deadline for the closure of submissions. Force said that the move to a digital platform will make keeping up with submissions more difficult, as technology advances quickly and the project team will have to stay up to date with making the archives “safe and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions are limited to UCSB-affiliated participants and will be curated through a “quality control process,” Stahl said, but noted that this process is only to filter out non-serious submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Force and Stahl are in the collecting phase of the project, the next step will be organizing the incoming submissions and data from participants, known as “post-capture work.” Here, Stahl and Force will work to preserve the files and find a place to store them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond preserving the everyday stories of the coronavirus pandemic, Force hopes that this project will open the community to the University Library’s archive work and encourage future collaborations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are places that want to tell their stories, that want to collect their history, that your individual experience matters,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Telling that story as accurately as possible and creating that safe space and kind of forging those bonds is critical to the human experience.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The new resolution will require the Internal Vice President to read a land recognition before every senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Esme Quintero-Cubillan, who was the first author on both resolutions, said her conversations with Mia Lopez, UCSB’s American Indian Student Association (AISA) tribal liaison, inspired her to write a resolution that was a “call to action” as well as a recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the public forum, students expressed the importance of representation for Indigenous students, who make up only 1% of the school’s population. Jeike Meijer, UCSB’s 2018-2019 External Vice President for Local Affairs and an Indigenous student, called on senators to do more for Indigenous communities in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A couple of minutes at the beginning of a senate meeting is so small, if you think about it, and as student leaders your platforms said that you aim to represent minorities and more minority groups. And this seems literally like the most tiny way that you can do that,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate passed a second resolution on Friday condemning the United States’ “inadequate response” to the conditions of the Navajo Nation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Navajo Nation is currently experiencing an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-03/la-na-navajo-nation-coronavirus-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infection rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is higher than New York City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quintero-Cubillan said the resolution also focuses on how the government “left [behind] the Navajo Nation” and “how they failed to provide for them” amidst a pandemic. The resolution details how the Navajo Nation has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and ensures the A.S. Senate will “continue to support the Navajo Nation through advocacy, awareness, and however stipulated by indigenous advocates.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were promised $8 million in aid, yet were only supplied body bags. And I really tried to hit home the idea that America genuinely does not care about Indigenous lives or Indigenous voices,” Quintero-Cubillan continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Quintero-Cubillan and Meijer emphasized the importance of holding the University of California (UC) accountable for harming indigenous communities, including the UC’s role in </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-05/thirty-meter-telescope-has-received-68m-from-uc-in-past-six-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding the Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Hawaii which is planned to be built on sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“America is occupied land.

Many people at the demonstration condemned Yang for his empty words and his failure to show up that day. Others referenced the lawsuits filed against the UC Police Department (UCPD) on the Santa Barbara campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May 2019, the Nexus reported that there were three active lawsuits against current and former members of the UCPD. Since then, more current and former officers have filed their own lawsuits. There are currently </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six active lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lawsuits allege serious misconduct by police officers within the department, including widespread racism and sexism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the university has failed to publicly address these lawsuits, or student concerns that stemmed from learning about them. Students, staff and faculty did not hear a single public assurance that these lawsuits or the misconduct alleged in them would be independently investigated, or that the department would be making any internal changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we did get were stories from The Current, the public relations arm of the university, </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new police chief, James Brock, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apparent changes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was making to the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus tried to interview Brock after he was first hired in April 2019 and after The Current published a </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about his “open-door policy” and “the importance of creating relationships with students and building trust between the student body and the department,” we were stonewalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any emails we sent to Brock were either ignored or directed to the public affairs department, who told us that Brock was too busy to speak with us directly and that we should email our questions to them, despite us emailing numerous times over the course of a month and offering flexibility in interview times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits are also not being dealt with publicly. Despite continuously reaching out to the lawyers, the Nexus has not been able to learn much about the progress of any internal mediations. As of April 2020, the university has been conducting an internal investigation into the allegations, according to a lawyer representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, the student body knows very little about what is happening within the UCSB Police Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December, Yang announced the </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2019-12-02-police-advisory-board\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Police Advisory Board. A memo about the board’s creation was posted to the Office of the Chancellor website, but there was no campus-wide email sent to the student body. Despite its goal of “enhanc[ing] communication between the police department and the campus community,” not a single email has been sent to students about the board’s progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers across the nation are protected by a lack of transparency and accountability within the criminal justice system that the UC and UCSB are perpetuating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yang wants to condemn and address the effects of police misconduct, he needs to start on this campus. Start by being transparent with the student body about what changes were made after the lawsuits were filed and about the disciplinary records of all the officers within the department. Students on this campus deserve to know who is policing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond UCSB, the UC system as a whole needs to do more. UC President Janet Napolitano and Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez sent out a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-protests-violence-following-george-floyd-s-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sunday condemning the recent racist killings of Black people and committing to “re-examine our own practices and ensure we continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing that we established two years ago.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC student journalist, Gabe Schneider, recently published an article titled “</span><a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/uc-campuses-have-disclosed-virtually-no-records-under-police-transparency-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Campuses Have Disclosed Virtually No Records Under Police Transparency Law,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that drew attention to how little transparency there is within UC police departments across the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schneider noted that the UC system “is aware of more than 200 incidents involving police use of force on its 10 campuses in recent years. Nearly half of those incidents resulted in the injury of an officer or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet only two police use of force case files have been released publicly,” Schneider wrote.                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s despite California Senate Bill 1421, a landmark transparency law that went into effect last year. It requires police to turn over internal records involving police shootings and use of force, and instances of sexual assault or lying by on-duty officers,” Schneider continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC needs to release these records, and it needs to be more transparent with students about the misconduct within its police departments.
