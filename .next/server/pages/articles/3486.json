You couldn’t be stressed out already … Or can you?</p></div>\n<div>The most common adjustment stressors for incoming freshmen and transfer students include homesickness, roommate issues and the fact that UCSB poses a more difficult academic setting than what incoming students might be familiar with, according to Kirsten Olson, Ph.D. and clinical psychologist at the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</div>\n<div>“They might be used to getting all As in high school without working very hard. Then those same study habits don’t work anymore, and they have to work much harder to get the same grades,” Olson said. “It’s similar for transfer students, in that they come from community colleges, and classes here are bigger and much harder.”</div>\n<div>But continuing students can also face stressful issues at the start of the new year, and the ones most likely to throw people into a crisis are relationship problems — from break-ups with a long-distance partner or roommate drama, to family concerns or problems with a professor, Olson said.</div>\n<div>“Relationship problems are the number one issues people come in to CAPS for, and they often cause the anxiety and depression,” Olson said. “Or, anxiety and depression come first, and that causes the relationship problems. Regardless, relationship problems compound everything.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>The Livin’ Ain’t So Easy: Social Anxiety in the Dorm Life</h4>\n<div>Two years ago, third-year psychology major Yasmin Irfani moved into her Santa Rosa triple as an out-of-state student from New York. While her living arrangement anxiety only lasted one week, it shocked her.</div>\n<div>“It was just so odd living in a room with two strangers you didn’t know at all,” Irfani said. “I was an only child back at home. Here, you don’t know how to be yourself yet and there’s that whole thing about trying to not be awkward, when communicating if it’s cool to talk on the phone a bit or to ask for space for your towel.”</div>\n<div>Immediately, the anxiety Irfani felt took a toll on her physical state. “I couldn’t sleep at night for the entire first week because I had been so sheltered in my childhood and I never got to go to sleepovers,” she said. “It was kind of about being on your own, not having family to rely on and wake you up for class in case your alarm didn’t go off.”</div>\n<div>Following those first few days of ‘going away to college’ stress, Irfani came across the UCSB Mental Health Peers when the organization was tabling at the Arbor. She found out about a stress management workshop, a 24/7 counseling line offered by CAPS and a multitude of other services.</div>\n<div>According to Olson, CAPS offers crisis intervention programs, short-term individual therapy and a wide variety of group therapy and counseling. She said there is also the Mental Health Peer Program — the same resource Irfani utilized — which gives students peer-to-peer counseling. “Oftentimes, people don’t want to talk to a psychologist, but rather to somebody they can relate to, in a different way,” she said.</div>\n<div>After talking to Mental Health Peers and a psychologist, Irfani said her worries about dorm life and other living adjustments were lifted.</div>\n<div>“After that, the rest of my transition was totally fine because I knew that I had that support. If I ever needed anything, I could do drop-in, schedule an appointment to talk to Mental Health Peers or a psychologist or call the 24-hour line,” Irfani said. “I didn’t feel alone anymore.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Alcohol and Drugs: A Quick Fix?</h4>\n<div>But for some students, the path to relieving stress is not always so straightforward. Back in January, Lauren Pierce, a third-year political science and global studies double major, regularly engaged in Greek life and sustained an active social and academic life typical for most college students. But in spite of her seemingly well put together front, Pierce had recently experienced the loss of her mother, who passed away on New Year’s Day.</div>\n<div>“I was there to see her at the hospital an hour before she passed,” she said. “Everything was fine and we were like, ‘Well, I’ll see you later.’ An hour after I left, she ended up passing away.”</div>\n<div>The experience left Pierce with a flurry of newfound emotional struggles, even as she attempted to continue her day-to-day life at the start of Winter Quarter.</div>\n<div>“I was more stressed on the simple question of, ‘What am I going to do now?’ My mom is gone.” Pierce said. “As soon as school started, I went into hyper-drive, thinking that I can’t let this bother me. But it was eating at me.”</div>\n<div>While Pierce received her worst GPA and faced other struggles that quarter, she said she continued to hide her pain from those around her. “I’m that kind of person who can literally put up a front that I’m fine. So, people around me didn’t know how to talk about it with me,” she said. “I didn’t want to take down anyone else’s day. I thought I had to remain composed, but it started to take a toll on me.”</div>\n<div>Eventually, Pierce began turning to alcohol to numb some of these negative emotions.</div>\n<div>“When you feel the urge to grieve, yeah it’s a shock, but if you hold it in, it’ll come out during really bad times,” Pierce said. “Like for me, for the first month of Winter Quarter or so, I was becoming best friends with alcohol. I knew it was wrong and I knew it wasn’t helping, but I tried to find something to fill that gap.”</div>\n<div>According to Lacey Johnson, a Drug &amp; Alcohol Program counselor, the unfilled gap that Pierce referred to is not uncommon for other students. Johnson said current trends indicate students have a hard time figuring out healthy ways to lower their anxiety levels and can sometimes resort to alcohol and drugs as an easy relief.</div>\n<div>“I see it all the time,” Johnson said. “It’s actually not so much a trend, as it is a constant.”</div>\n<div>The reason behind this constant, Johnson said, could be the discrepancy between the perceived and actual use of potentially addictive substances amongst college students. Citing data from a National College Health Assessment study in 2011, Johnson said that while about 76 percent of college students admitted to using alcohol in the past 30 days, the perceived use of alcohol was actually much higher — at 98 percent.</div>\n<div>The study also revealed that while about 40 percent of students admitted to using marijuana in the past 30 days, the perceived use of the drug was a surprising 96 percent. Additionally, while the actual use of drugs other than marijuana was only roughly 15 percent, the rate of perceived use of these substances came out to 82 percent.</div>\n<div>Johnson encouraged students to take a holistic approach to dealing with stress and explore different types coping mechanisms — such as exercise, yoga, artistic expression, socializing, watching movies or enjoying the outdoors.</div>\n<div>“Try not to use substances as a form of coping,” Johnson said. “Find other healthy ways. Maybe these things are being involved in a sport or a hobby that you can continue doing at UCSB, or maybe consider trying new things to deal with stress here.”</div>\n<div>The Alcohol &amp; Drug Program offers services like free and confidential counseling or support groups for anything from marijuana moderation to the development of healthy family relationships, Johnson said.</div>\n<div>“We are a nonjudgmental service, here to help students on campus make safe and healthy decisions,” Johnson said. “We really understand what’s going on at UCSB and at Isla Vista, so we’re here to meet students where they’re at and give them the support they need.”</div>\n<div>Navigating through Stigmas and Finding Campus Resources</div>\n<div>For Pierce, her healing did not begin until she opened up to a friend, who also happened to be her Bible study leader and urged Pierce to find solace in her religious faith. While Pierce said she understands why others would reach out to counseling or psychological programs, she chose to turn to her faith.</div>\n<div>“I kind of wish I could’ve went to therapy or something, but I don’t know,” she said. “When you come from my kind of family — with Dad being a military man — family problems are familyproblems, not therapist problems.”</div>\n<div>At CAPS, Olson said she noticed stigmas are a big reason for people to skip out on therapy or counseling aid during stressful situations, “Sometimes people think they go to therapy because they’re crazy, weak or something’s wrong with them. Okay, certainly people come in when they’re in crisis, but you don’t have to wait until you have a crisis, and all because you come to therapy does not mean you’re crazy or weak.”</div>\n<div>UCSB currently offers an array of programs serving these emotional needs and Jackie Kurta, clinical manager of the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, said one such program is ‘Gaucho FYI’ — a new service that provides 90-minute educational workshops for students in groups of 25 to 30.</div>\n<div>“There’s something good about being in a small group with your peers,” Kurta said of the program. “Plus, the students leading the workshops are from all different kinds of organizations on campus, like CAPS, Health &amp; Wellness, the Women’s Center and UC Police Department.”</div>\n<div>In addition, Health Educator at the Health &amp; Wellness Program Michael Takahara said programs like Gaucho FYI act as an innovative method to approach first-year and transfer students and introduce them to the wide variety of programs and departments on campus.</div>\n<div>For example, the Health &amp; Wellness Program uses research strategies to improve students’ well-being, offering weekly training courses and holding workshops on topics like communication skills and healthy eating, Takahara said.</div>\n<div>“Not only are we plugging the students to go to the Recreation Center and Student Health to work on their physical health, CAPs for mental health and Health &amp; Wellness for social health, but we’re also promoting the idea of working on your full being,” Takahara said. “This is about health from not just one part of your life, but as a whole — as a human being, a student, a worker and a community member.”</div>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Stress That Can Build Toward Depression and Suicide …</h4>\n<div>According to CAPS statistics, Olson said suicide is the second leading cause of death amongst college students, “We’re doing a lot of campaigning and outreach efforts to let students know about warning signs of suicide, [like] how to be a bystander for intervention and help students recognize the signs, not only in themselves but also in a friend.”</div>\n<div>The same statistics, Olson noted, revealed that 50 percent of graduates and undergraduates report feeling depressed and at some point have trouble functioning, and she said social engagement can act as the best solution for these struggles, such as “talking to friend, family member, TA or RA.”</div>\n<div>For third-year pre-biology major Nathan Pinckard, his strong connection with his family, friends and faith helped him overcome a severe allergic reaction to a prescription acne drug, Accutane, and the brief sweep of suicidal thoughts that ensued.</div>\n<div>“What was hard, emotionally, was that my confidence was destroyed and broken down, and I couldn’t look people in the face anymore. I would avoid the mirror when I was in the bathroom,” Pinckard said. “Psychologically, I had never really contemplated suicide before, but during that time, the thoughts were kind of there. They weren’t at the forefront of my brain, but they were in the background: ‘You could end your suffering now.’”</div>\n<div>But Pinckard didn’t.</div>\n<div>With strong support from his family and friends, as well as staying connected to his Christian faith, Pinckard said he was able to come out of his depressive episode.</div>\n<div>“I was constantly on the phone with my mom and dad during that time,” Pinckard said. “A lot of it was family support and any support system. There was the Intervarsity [Christian Fellowship] community, full of prayers — that’s what got me through it.”</div>\n<div>Pinckard said he dispelled stress by taking long walks, reading other people’s similar stories on online forums and listening to Bob Marley, but most of the relief consisted of open communication.</div>\n<div>“When you’re stuck in your head and you’re thinking and thinking, you’re not getting rid of stress,” Pinckard said. “What helped was the communication with family and support groups. I then got in contact with my dermatologist again, and she prescribed me two different drugs, both of which really helped me get back on track.”</div>\n<div>Stress: the Conquerable Foe</div>\n<div>So maybe the first week of school isn’t so stress-free after all. But don’t fret, Gauchos. Stress is conquerable.</div>\n<div>Olson urges students to seek out support in any way they find comfortable, whether it is the utilization of a campus service, finding support in family and/or religion or just seeking out a simple conversation with a friend.</div>\n<div>“College is about discovering who you are, discovering yourself as a person and having healthy relationships,” Olson said. “We’re here not only to make people successful students, but also to make sure they become successful Gauchos and successful people in general.”</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the September 26, 2013 print issue.</em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52061\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/first-day-of-school-already-a-stress-fest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52061\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/first-day-of-school-already-a-stress-fest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/first-day-of-school-already-a-stress-fest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/first-day-of-school-already-a-stress-fest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/first-day-of-school-already-a-stress-fest/","id":3486,"author":{"id":195,"name":"Rilla Peng"},"related":[3485,3484,3483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":195,"name":"Rilla Peng","biography":"Not available","articles":[3073,3086,3478,3486],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Work When you Need to, Play When you Want to","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/houses.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/houses.jpg?resize=960%2C588&ssl=1","description":"Balancing the pressures of school with the intensity of IV social life can be tough to get the hang of.

With many students drinking out of those ubiquitous red cups, some party-goers fail to consider the true volume of alcohol entering their bodies, Vego said. It’s also important to take note of the difference in alcohol content of hard liquor versus alcoholic beverages like beer and wine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Eat before drinking</span></p>\n<p>The human body naturally wants to eat every three to four hours, so you’ll want to put some food in your stomach before going out, Vego said. Satisfying those alcohol-induced munchies by eating after (or during) drinking is not proven to help lower blood alcohol concentration, although it can lessen the intensity of a hangover.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Drink plenty of water</span></p>\n<p>Drink water between drinks, as well as before and after drinking. Dehydration is the leading cause of hangovers, and that’s that shit no one likes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6><em><span style=\"color: #000080; font-size: x-large;\">Cracking the Books</span></em></h6>\n<h6></h6>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Go to office hours</span></p>\n<p>Within their first quarter, most new students find themselves crammed in massive lecture halls, amongst a sea of hundreds of other students. Attending office hours and building relationships with professors can bring valuable opportunities like performing research or receiving much-coveted recommendation letters further down the road. “You don’t need to have anything profound to say when you talk to your professor. Just introducing yourself and saying hello will get it started,” according to Dr. Dorothy Mullin, communication professor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Use campus resources</span></p>\n<p>The piles of ‘free’ activities, food and services are never-ending at UCSB, and in some way or another, they’re always needed. CLAS tutoring can help with academic struggles, while Counseling and Psychological Services, Career Services and the Health and Wellness can help with other areas of life. Even Associated Students and the Office of Student Life sometimes hold fun and helpful events, while offering other services. There’s also a Gaucho Skills page on Tumblr that includes 500 study tips from experts at UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Prioritize your work</span></p>\n<p>Making fancy Snapchats or beating your friends at beer pong might seem like a pressing concern at the time, but procrastination bears an ugly head come Midterms or Finals Week. “There’s no such thing as catching up on the quarter system. You’re either half a step ahead, or blowing it,” Paul Rivas, academic skills coordinator for CLAS, said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t skip classes</span></p>\n<p>Some professors seem to, or actually do, just read out of the book. Why get out of bed when you can learn everything at home? Because you’re paying for the lecture, and chances are, the classes you skip will miraculously include specific material that will be on the test.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Don’t View classes as worthless</span></p>\n<p>We all need to get those General Education Requirements out of the way, so we end up taking classes seemingly irrelevant to our major or interests. But the fact is that diverse knowledge is the key to a well-rounded education, and a positive attitude can turn a ‘worthless’ class into a passion or even change of major.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Join a campus club or activity</span></p>\n<p>Whether you like exercise, activism, religious worship or even journalism, don’t be afraid to take advantage of what UCSB has to offer. There are groups for all interests, cultures, sexual orientations political causes, and if there isn’t one that suits you, then start one!Gladys Koscak, mental health specialist at Counseling and Psychological Services, said extracurricular activities are vital in maintaining a stress-free lifestyle. Likewise, Vice Chancellor Michael Young said he encourages students to explore their usual interests, but also “take some risks.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Take advantage of the beach</span></p>\n<p>The only school nationwide with its own private beach, UCSB is just minutes away from the shore. Start the morning off right with a relaxing jog, or try out surfing. With our high-ranking surf team, we’ve been recognized by Surf Magazine and other outlets as a top competitor in the sport.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Explore the Santa Barbara area, get away from campus</span><br>\nCheck out the Santa Barbara Zoo, go shopping or out to dinner on State Street, hike the Santa Ynez mountains or organize a group to go bowling. With the bus system free for all students, there is no reason to be stuck!<br>\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"> Maintain healthy relationships</span><br>\nA solid support network of people you trust is essential in keeping stress at a minimum, Koscak said, noting that such bonds can alleviate stress and loneliness.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Remember to take care of yourself</span></p>\n<p>Try to incorporate stress-relieving strategies into your routine as early as possible. As Koscak explained, stress is not necessary to the student experience, “It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that college students have to be stressed to be considered legitimate students,” Koscak said. “The truth is that the sooner you can find ways to cope in healthy ways, the better time you will have in college.”</p>\n<h6><em><span style=\"color: #000080; font-size: x-large;\">Beyond I.V.</span></em></h6>\n<p>– Swim, surf and just soak up some sun at Goleta Beach, Sands, or Campus Point<br>\n– Take an adventurous hike through Lizard’s Mouth, Inspiration Point, or the Santa Ynez Mountains<br>\n– Go cliff diving at Red Rock and plunge into its gnarly swimming hole<br>\n– Hit up State Street for high-end shopping and dining (the 24X bus goes straight there from the dorms)<br>\n– Check out the West Wind Santa Barbara Drive-In Theater<br>\n– Get in some late night ‘glowbowling’ at Zodo’s Bowling and Beyond<br>\n– Check out live music at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Velvet Jones or SoHo downtown</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/work-when-you-need-to-play-when-you-want-to/","id":3483,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[3482,3481,3480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Watching Your Keystrokes?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Internet Creeping Emerges As Potential Method of Evaluating Applicants in Competitive Job Market, College Admissions","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Internet Creeping Emerges As Potential Method of Evaluating Applicants in Competitive Job Market, College Admissions</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have you Googled yourself lately? If the answer is yes, you’re probably not the only one digging up the Internet’s version of your personal history.</p>\n<p>From February 11 to March 6 of last year, a nationwide survey conducted by the employment website CareerBuilder.com found 39 percent of companies use social networking sites to research their job candidates. Meanwhile, only 11 percent of survey respondents said they do not check online profiles.</p>\n<p>The survey’s findings suggest employers use social media to look into the applicants’ personality and behavior outside their job interview, helping them gauge how well the candidate can fit in with the company culture. Examples of content examined include the positive, such as conveyence of a professional image or display of creativity, and the negative — such as posting of provocative photos, bad mouthing previous employers or even alcohol and drug use.</p>\n<p>But the ongoing trend is not a new one. In 2006, a survey by the private business network ExecuNet discovered 77 percent of corporate executives reported using social media sites to learn more about job applicants. A third of this 77 percent indicated that they found enough “digital dirt” to reject a potential candidate’s application.</p>\n<p>In light of this, Bradley Shear, a Maryland attorney who specializes in social media law, said he cautions job-seekers from posting potential harmful content on their social media pages. Shear advised Congressional Representative Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) in authoring the Social Network Online Protection Act, a bill forbidding institutions of higher education and employers from requesting access to student or applicant social network accounts. However, Shear said online content is never safe from employers’ eyes.</p>\n<p>“Candidates for employment are being searched online all of the time,” Shear said. “Searching candidates online has become part and parcel of the hiring process, and there is nothing illegal about performing an Internet search about someone applying for a job, just like it is not illegal to ask for references and/or past employers to verify information about a candidate.”</p>\n<p>But one of the difficulties that arise when employers Google names and online profiles of prospetive employees, according to Shear, is the growing prevalence of fake social media accounts. CNN reported in August 2012 that Facebook estimated there was about 83 million false Facebook accounts that year. Soon after, the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission filed a 2012 report identifying two problematic types of Facebook accounts: the “misclassified” and the “undesirable accounts” — the latter group being profiles that have violated any of Facebook’s terms of service policies.</p>\n<p>Because of this, Shear said it is difficult for an employer to know whether the online identity found is the right identity. In this case, he said it is illegal in some states for employers to request applicants to verify their online identities. States prohibiting this practice are California, Illinois, Maryland and Michigan.</p>\n<p>However, Shear said the law is not designed to protect people who abuse the freedoms inherent to the Internet.</p>\n<p>“The law is meant to protect those going out of the way to protect their own privacy and not those who are careless online,” Shear said. “If someone is being careless, that is their own problem.”</p>\n<p>Currently, many social media sites are taking a stand against the practice of employers using online profiles as a measure of one’s personal character. For example, Facebook — the largest social networking service worldwide — issued a statement in March 2012 condemning such activities.</p>\n<p>“As a user, you shouldn’t be forced to share your private information and communications just to get a job,” the statement said. “And as the friend of a user, you shouldn’t have to worry that your private information or communications will be revealed to someone you don’t know and didn’t intend to share with, just because that user is looking for a job,” according to the statement, which was authored by the company’s chief privacy officer, Eric Egan.</p>\n<p>Scrutiny of applicants’ social media profiles does not only exist for employment purposes. Kaplan Test Prep recently released a summary of its survey of college admissions officers and found that 31 percent of respondents — a bump up from 26 percent last year — said they visited an applicant’s social networking page to learn more about them. In addition, 30 percent of admissions officers polled said they found online content that negatively impacted a student’s application.</p>\n<p>In 2013, roughly 21.8 million high school graduates were expected to enroll in over 4,400 degree granting institutions in the United States, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. With more students than ever enrolling in college, the big question becomes: Shouldn’t freshmen and transfer applicants be worried?</p>\n<p>Christine Brown, Executive Director of Kaplan Test Prep’s College Prep Programs, said she believes otherwise.</p>\n<p>“Students should be aware and careful, but not worried,” Brown said. “There is no reason to say that admissions officers are doing this for any nefarious reasons. They often do searches for themselves to see what people are saying about their schools.”</p>\n<p>However, Brown said students must stay proactive about being responsible for maintaining and posting appropriate online content.</p>\n<p>“Your social media presence is something that you have a lot of control over,” Brown said. “Students need to recognize that anything and everything they post online can be fair game — fairly or unfairly.”</p>\n<p>But disquieting stories of students’ social media profiles harming them for job or school applications has prompted countless news sites to suggest students “clean up” their profiles during application season. In November 2013, the New York Times ran an article discussing an online profile situation gone wrong for a student applying to Bowdoin College in Massachusetts. The student attended an on-campus information session and later posted negative comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees. According to the article, her actions garnered criticism from Bowdoin’s Dean of Admissions, and she was denied admission to the university.</p>\n<p>Despite such stories, Brown said the actual chances of a student being looked up for the sake of admissions are not necessarily high. She said application officers probably only do so if a student’s application contains different or unique elements, whether alarming or impressive.</p>\n<p>“Generally, there needs to be a flag, something good or negative,” Brown said. “It could be anything.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UC spokesperson Dianne Klein said the sheer number of applicants makes it unrealistic for admission officers to be browsing through online profiles on networks such as Facebook or Twitter. According to a 2013 information summary report offered through the UC Office of the President, 174,767 students applied to the UC for Fall 2013 — an increase of 8.6 percent from the number of fall applicants the year before. The report also stated these gains in admissions were being seen by all UC campuses, from Berkeley’s increase of 8.1 percent to Santa Cruz’s increase of 14.8 percent.</p>\n<p>“We do not check applicants on social media,” Klein said in an email. “We simply have too many applicants to do that.”</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions, said reviewing social media content of applicants has never been a part of the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“It has never been done at UC Santa Barbara. The only information used in our review of an applicant is the information they provide on the UC application,” Przekop said. “We would not have need to review social media profiles.”</p>\n<p>But even when schools do opt to check students’ online profiles, applicants can protect themselves through various privacy options. Brown said applicants always have the choice to crack down on their privacy settings, or refuse to add “friends” and other connections they do not recognize.</p>\n<p>“We encourage students to be aware that their digital footprint and online persona is part of their identity,” Brown said. “Also keep in mind that college admissions officers are just that: admissions officers. They aren’t privacy experts or sleuths. They don’t have magic passwords to open your private Facebook account or Twitter feed. They are overwhelmingly judging your application on the traditional factors like your GPA and SAT or SAT score.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Brown said the choice of being careful lies with the students, saying it is their job to do the best they can in cleaning up their online footprints.</p>\n<p>“We advise students to check their digital trails and keep them clean. Search yourself on Google, Bing and other search engines and clean up anything that doesn’t put you in a positive light,” Brown said. “Be smart and think about everything you post online before you do it. The Internet has a long memory.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 8, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yet we still lack the socio-economic diversity of most other UC’s, with the highest average parental income of any UC and the smallest proportion of minority groups.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Demographics are shifting though, and this year’s freshmen are the most diverse and academically lauded of any class in the school’s history.
