","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” sets a shining standard of mediocrity for action films and further serves as proof that live-action manga adaptations (well, more like anime adaptations, in this case) are generally not good ideas. Of course, giving writing duties to one of the minds behind “Transformers” hardly helps. The final product is a substandard action film that drowns the humanistic themes of its source material under a deluge of headache-inducing CGI cityscapes and a painfully bland corporate conspiracy story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarlett Johansson plays Major Mira Killian, the first person to have their brain inserted into a purely cybernetic body. As a result, she can hack into the cyberbrains of other people and has superhuman abilities. Basically, she’s playing Black Widow again, but now her skin-tight bodysuit is flesh-toned. After her transformation, the corporate mind behind the Major’s creation, Cutter, comes up with the brilliant idea of taking this investment he holds so dear to his heart and putting her in a counter-terrorism unit. Smart business move there, bud. Put your experimental business asset in a profession in which getting a bullet in the ass is right in the job description. Then again, what can one expect when the film’s idea of a pre-asskicking one-liner is “The truth is … I wasn’t built to dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Major spends the first third of her own screen-time questioning her humanity, a theme central to the original manga source material that depicts a world in which cybernetic augmentation is as common as wearing a watch. The film makes this abundantly clear to us by showing a variety of humans who have undergone some sort of modification or other: chips in the brain to play music, cybernetic eyes, stuff like that. However, this deep thematic content goes down the toilet pretty fast in favor of “Matrix”-esque gunfights (in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow motion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and the tortuously cliché story of the super-agent searching for their forgotten past. Hey, DreamWorks. Jason Bourne called. He wants his plot back. Oh, and he’s also suing for defamation.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ghost in the Shell” also tries to distract you from the shortcomings of its plot by shoving enough holograms in your face to make you see binary code. Every 10 minutes or so, you’re treated to the sight of gigantic, colorful holographic advertisements pulled straight out of “Blade Runner” and waving at you. Once, it’s cool. Twice, it’s artistic. Eight times and the scenery is not only overpowering whatever character is in the shot, but the movie is also treating you like a complete moron. Yes, I know it’s a sci-fi movie, thank you very much. Now get to the next scene before I decide to go sneak in to see “Logan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps my analysis is a little too harsh. The film is at least visually inventive and arresting, that much can be said. Holograms aren’t used in any groundbreaking story manner, but in small touches, like having them disintegrate like sand upon the end of a conversation, which lends at least a little personality to their measly existence.  And the Major’s deep dive, her hacking into another cyber-brain, provides for a darkly hallucinatory experience (albeit one that is, weirdly enough, evocative of both “Code Lyoko” and Kingdom Hearts)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all its attempts to divert your attention that there is little under the surface of this shell, the third act kicks in hard. As the pieces fall into place, things actually start getting at least a little interesting when the questions about the Major’s identity are answered. The thing is, as someone who was at least a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">familiar with the source material, I was able to see the twist coming from a mile off.  Maybe others won’t and will be blown away by it. The interesting question though, without giving too much away, is can a movie be truly accused of whitewashing when the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">character </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herself has been literally whitewashed?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the film does not seem to care about the implications, nor does the protagonist dwell upon her revelation. “Ghost in the Shell” is still a dumb action movie, ground into a pulp by the Hollywood wringer. It may look somewhat the same as Masamune Shirow’s work, but its soul has been rent and mangled, rendered unrecognizable. The best I can say about the movie is that it takes the indecipherable technobabble of its source material and trades it in for a couple of entertaining and occasionally seizure-inducing combat scenes.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fellow Artsweek writer Ryan Hykes rates this movie an 8/10.  And that’s why he writes album reviews.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-12/the-ghost-in-the-hollow-shell-of-a-movie/","id":5833,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5832,5831,5830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Five Directors Honored at SBIFF","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Outstanding Directors Award ceremony was held on Feb. 7, with the Arlington Theatre playing host to such acclaimed filmmakers as Damien Chazelle, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins, Kenneth Lonergan and ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from celebrating the stars in front of the camera, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) also takes the time to praise the artists behind it.

After an eight-year hiatus from filmmaking, he made “Moonlight”, a film about a Miami teen struggling with issues of family and sexuality. Its success made Jenkins the first African-American to earn Oscar nominations for directing, writing, and best picture. It premiered, fittingly enough, at Telluride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was cool as hell,” Jenkins said, grinning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film, he said, had much personal significance to him and the man who wrote the play on which it was based, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both of them had cocaine-addicted mothers, and Naomie Harris plays one in the film. Jenkins had to hold his ears backstage so he wouldn’t hear the clip featuring her, the memories still fresh in his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenneth Lonergan, writer and director of “Manchester by the Sea”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed Jenkins. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was able to briefly converse with him:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung: Why was the setting of Manchester so important to the film and to Lee?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonergan:  I guess because of the way the script developed. It started out as an arbitrary choice, and then I did a lot of research on the town. I think just all the elements of the environment of a story can be really important part of it.  If you think of movies like “The Last Picture Show” or “Hell or High Water,” for instance, and “Moonlight” … you don’t want “Moonlight” to be anywhere but Miami, and it really couldn’t be, in a way. It’s a little hard to say why. I think a place has a personality just like a person does, and once you’ve got that personality into the story, it’s hard to imagine it without it.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film’s (impressively heart-wrenching) story was the brainchild of John Krasinski and Matt Damon, who dropped out of directing and starring duties. The role of the emotionally detached protagonist Lee Chandler ended up going to Casey Affleck, earning him an Oscar nod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s just incredible,” Lonergan praised him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primarily a writer, Lonergan has been practicing his craft since the fifth grade. He did copious amounts of research regarding the film’s setting, allowing him to incorporate minute details such as that the nearest hospital to Manchester is in Beverly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m always very interested in the life led [in the places I go.] Everywhere just has a different feel to it,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the film’s extremely dour subject matter, Lonergan made sure to incorporate some humor into it, as “without the humor, the movie’s dead.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there was Denis Villeneuve, who also made himself available for a brief red carpet interview. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75633\" style=\"width: 177px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1579677773\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75630\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75633\" data-attachment-id=\"75633\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/outstanding-director-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Outstanding Director-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75633\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2-167x250.jpg?resize=167%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Outstanding-Director-2.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehrung: Your screenwriter Eric [Heisserer] came to UCSB a little while ago, and he said he talked to you about things like politics and religion together. Did those conversations influence how you two cooperated on making “Arrival?”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve: Yeah, definitely. I spent a lot of time, a lot of coffees with Eric in order to develop the screenplay. I mean, it came with a very strong first draft, and my job as a director is to guide the screenwriter, to move forward, to shape the movie to the way I would love it to be. So, yes, definitely. A lot of conversations helped a lot in building the world we were dreaming of. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villeneuve, known for directing dramas like “Prisoners” and “Sicario,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said it’s been a long-time ambition to make a sci-fi film, having been influenced by comic books, Steven Spielberg and Alejandro Jodorowsky (who also took a crack at making “Dune,”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which Villeneuve is signed on to direct). The problem with modern sci-fi films, Villeneuve said, is that they have a “lack of freshness” on account of being more about the technology than the ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On “Arrival”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself, Villeneuve said, “Amy [Adams] was my muse.  She was my first choice,” and, “For me, the movie was about this woman’s journey and her revelation about death.” One thing he tried very hard to avoid was crafting the film in a way that information would be spoon-fed to the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening capped off with (as is SBIFF tradition) all five directors taking the stage to discuss their early cinematic influences with Hammond, with answers ranging from “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Disney</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then “Risky Business”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">director Paul Brickman took the stage to praise his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were two common threads [of tonight’s films]: a strong emotional center and, in this corporate world of ours, these were fiercely personal visions. It gives me a lot of hope,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noting that members of the Directors Guild of America had considerably short lifespans, he quipped, “Let’s get these awards out while they’re still healthy,” and the five thus received their very pointy gold trophies from volunteers before standing up for a final round of photos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-10/five-directors-honored-at-sbiff/","id":5830,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5829,5828,5827],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Logan’ is a Movie for the Comic Books","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Ever since his first appearance, Wolverine has been one of the most beloved characters in the X-Men film franchise. Actor Hugh Jackman has played this part so well that his version of the character has become a very recognizable pop culture icon in recent years. Now, after eight movies, he will end his long run as the well-known superhero in his final film as the mutant hero, “Logan.”</p>\n<p>It’s the year 2029, and mutants have been nearly extinct. Wolverine, or Logan, has lost his healing ability, and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has been affected by Alzheimer’s, which has left him unable to fully control his powers. They are on the edge of the Mexican border, working to eventually live a better life, when they accept the calling of a woman who wants them to escort a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across America to the Canadian border.</p>\n<p>Despite developing over the course of the franchise, Jackman’s character undergoes the fabled hero’s journey as if his character is just being introduced to us. By placing huge limitations on his mutant powers, Wolverine feels different from how he was in past installments, as tension for his life slowly begins to rise. While it is slightly helpful to understand Logan’s relationship with Charles Xavier in past films, one does not need to know any specific events of previous entries to follow this film’s plot. It almost seems as though director James Mangold approached this story as if the other X-Men movies never happened.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of this, “Logan” distances itself from all previous X-Men installments tonally and stylistically, as it earns an R rating. Apart from bloodier action scenes and more profanity, Mangold uses this opportunity to create a more mature movie. The themes and mood reflect this, as the setting is not as colorful as it was in the franchise. The cinematography and costume design suggest a harsher world, where the threat from the enemy is worse than ever. With this setup, Mangold tries to break apart from the comic book genre to make something entirely different. Despite having great action scenes, the best moments of the movie were the simple character moments that the MCU movies typically don’t care to include. Sharing themes with the stories “Children of Men” or “The Last of Us,” the comic book elements are seamlessly integrated into the film, as the movie doesn’t feel remotely like a “comic book movie.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76316\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"239781688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76314\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76316\" data-attachment-id=\"76316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/logan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"logan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>That is, until the second half.</p>\n<p>Up to this point, the film was nearly flawless. There might have been a few technical issues and some slight over-acting from Patrick Stewart, but perhaps I was just nitpicking at the movie. However, the film truly does reach a climax, because the film starts to falter right after its best moments. The pacing starts to drag, and major plot elements slowly become sillier. In the first half, the film felt like a neo-Western that simply included four mutants, as it relied on the various character arcs and interactions instead of “comic book elements” to progress the story forward. With the introduction of a younger Wolverine clone, the increased inclusion of Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant) and his plan involving mutant children, the film started to take a dive back into being a comic book movie. The second half isn’t completely awful; it’s just that the first half had such a perfect balance that it set high expectations for the rest of the film.</p>\n<p>However, because of these expectations, even the smallest falters made the film appear more unbalanced, as the comic book elements became very present. As more characters were introduced, the film started to become overcomplicated. With these sudden inclusions, the film removed some of the realistic, serious undertones that the first half was spent building upon. The biggest strength of the first half was that there was almost a complete lack of superpowers used in a superhero movie. Even then, the mutant powers fit the mood that the film set for itself. But as the film went into the second half, it seemed as if characters and scenes were written into the script just so the film could make other major moments happen. If the screenwriters did a few more tweaks, they could have still gotten to these moments while staying true to the tone they set for the film. The characters established in the first half could easily hold the movie on their own. Those who appeared in the second half could have just been mentioned, and the film would have worked just fine.</p>\n<p>Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre (as most people are suggesting for the film overall). If the film was strong throughout, then it would certainly be “The Dark Knight” of the X-Men franchise. But as it stands now, it is solely a solid comic book film. While Jackman didn’t end his 17-year run as Wolverine on the best note possible, he sure did end on a great one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/","id":5831,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5830,5829,5828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Selfishly Abusing Our of Freedom of Speech","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/minilettertotheditor1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1","description":"Should certain on-campus protests come with trigger warnings? Second-year Delyla Mayers thinks so.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Within the past two quarters, the abortion debate on campus has risen to an astronomical level. While I will not personally reveal my position on abortion, I feel that the materials the UCSB community has been exposed to have become increasingly more violent and triggering, meaning these materials often invoke a highly negative and/or emotional, mental or psychological response by people who have been affected.</p>\n<p>Recently, I’ve seen more overwhelmingly insensitive material from the Pro-Life groups (both stemming from this campus and from off-campus organizations) on UCSB grounds. Personally, I feel their position on abortion is not the offensive matter in question, but I have a serious problem with their approach in how they are trying to educate and “inform” the student body.</p>\n<p>In the case of recent events that have taken place, such as the “Graveyard” that took place in front of the SRB Fall Quarter and the overwhelmingly bloody and gory pictures that were displayed in the Arbor on March 4, 2014, UCSB students were given no warning that these events would be taking place; instead, students such as myself have had the unfortunate experience of being ambushed by these triggering materials. While I do believe events such as the “Graveyard” event — where numerous white crosses were placed in the lawn outside of the SRB signifying a ceremony for the loss of life — can be very beneficial for some, I feel students should be given the opportunity to actively choose to be a part of such events, not have the issue thrown at them while biking or walking through public pathways.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is becoming increasingly unacceptable and insensitive. I understand that all are entitled to freedom of speech to express one’s opinions, but students should be given a warning before they are subjected to seeing such images blatantly placed in front of them. These groups have taken no consideration to the individuals who are directly or indirectly affected by abortion. UCSB prides itself on inclusivity and diversity, yet these groups have actively chosen to ignore the myriad people these images negatively impact. These groups have chosen to overlook these experiences, placing harmful and potentially damaging materials in front of students without so much as a warning. Student announcements are sent out every day, giving students warnings about numerous things; why aren’t such events required to do the same? I don’t think any group should be above that. It’s not the position I have a problem with, but rather the approach that is very insensitive, non-inclusive, violent and dangerous. These groups have failed to give students the right to choose to partake in such events, stripping individuals from their choice to practice self-care in topics as deep as abortion.</p>\n<p>I am in no way representing any group I am affiliated with in regards to my opinion on this matter; however, as a student, I feel personally affected by the insensitivity shown towards the countless people who are affected by abortion. I am overwhelmed by these events and images, and I feel empathy for the students I witnessed crying after these protests. My intention is not to bash these groups, as the groups themselves and their position on abortion are of no pressing issue to me; however, their approach has been very triggering and problematic, especially in times as stressful as finals.</p>\n<p>These groups are threatening the well-being of students, yet nothing is being done. We should not feel unsafe on our own campus. These acts of shaming and violence are beyond unacceptable, and in no case have these groups warned the student body before showing such images on campus. These groups need to see that although they are successful in initiating a response, it is not always about the damage you know you’re doing, but the damage you unknowingly do.</p>\n<p><em>Delyla Mayers is a second-year feminist studies and sociology major.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, March 6, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
