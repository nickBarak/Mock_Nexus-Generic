You are texted an address to a party your friend is hosting and decide to go. You arrive at the door, where a couple guys are standing, apparently checking who is entering the party. They seem to be letting everyone in. However, when your group tries to enter, one of the guys blocks the entrance and says to his friend, “Wait, they look gay.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, they do,” he responds. “Sorry, you guys can’t come in.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“But we know the girl who is hosting this party. Her friends invited us, too.”</p>\n<p>“Um … Um, okay come in quickly, but no more of you.”</p>\n<p>Fast forward to Saturday night: You are walking down Sabado in costume with a close friend. You pass a house with a few guys sitting on the porch.</p>\n<p>“Hey, look guys, it’s gay dudes,” they yell.</p>\n<p>You ignore them.</p>\n<p>“Hey, we are talking to you. Yeah, you two. Fucking fags.”</p>\n<p>What do you do? Do you get angry and respond? Do you continue to ignore them? What if you ignore them and it only angers them more? What if they leave their porch, and approach you to start a fight? Or do you say something? Do you flick them off? What if you do and that, too, angers them, causing them to get up and attack you? Or do you just walk away quickly? Or run?</p>\n<p>These are real experiences that I witnessed and had in Isla Vista this weekend. And I am not alone. And it is not only during Halloween that these types of things happen. And it is not only against gay-identified males. And it is not okay.</p>\n<p>I am proud of my sexuality. Being called a “fucking fag” was painful and angering but not life threatening at that time. I avoided physical contact, brushed off the words and moved on with my night. And I had a great night.</p>\n<p>But there are those at UCSB who struggle with their gender, sexuality and identity every single day. There are people who do not have the privilege of being proud like me. People who are “in the closet,” not because they are not courageous, but because staying in the closet is a matter of survival. Because they are in a fraternity and are afraid to isolate themselves from their heterosexual frat brothers. Because if their parents find out, they would stop paying for tuition. Because if they stand up for themselves, they could have their asses beaten by a bunch of drunk guys in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Homophobia is very real in our community. It is not wise to simply write these situations off as minor incidents. There are many that go unreported. There are those who may feel like sharing a hate-crime incident that they endured could “out” them. Or cause more violence against them.</p>\n<p>But I, frankly, have had enough. Today, it is a few hateful words. Tomorrow, it is violence against another student. Or possibly, those homophobic slurs could trigger someone to hurt themselves.</p>\n<p>It’s time the larger UCSB population came together to propose solutions to stop homophobia. We are a beautiful, educated and broad-minded community. Let’s start acting like it.</p>\n<p><em>If you have any comments, concerns or personal experiences you would like to share, please email Andrew Farkash at andrewfarkash@gmail.com.

At UCSB, students of color were determined to give themselves a voice in a place where it may not be welcome. From this emerged the MultiCultural Center Council, a coalition of diverse student organizations whose goal is to create and maintain an inclusive campus and community climate at UCSB.</p>\n<p>You may be asking, what is an inclusive campus and community climate at UCSB? For the MCC council, an inclusive climate consists of tolerance and the fair exchange of ideas in order to maintain a safe space. Whereas before, diverse groups were marginalized, it is now more important than ever to maintain the diversity that we have attained at UCSB. As demonstrated by 2010’s hate incidents toward students across the UCs, it is clear that we need to work harder toward creating a safe space for everyone in the UCSB community. This is possible through exchanging ideas, which results from collaboration among different communities, encouraging the development of allies and fairly representing all communities within UCSB.</p>\n<p>We, as the MCC Council, expect the UCSB community to participate in creating and maintaining an inclusive campus climate. To begin, we expect the UCSB community to exercise their rights in a manner that will respect everyone’s presence. This includes holding Isla Vista residents and visitors accountable for their actions. When unacceptable incidents do occur, we expect UCSB faculty, staff and student body to react appropriately. This consists of informing the community about incidents in a timely manner, having a direct and appropriate response and allowing the UCSB community to have a productive discussion while maintaining a safe space. Most importantly we wish to uphold our campus’ motto of “Scholarship, Leadership, and Citizenship”!</p>\n<p>The MCC Council does not ask our community to do anything we are not willing to do ourselves; therefore, we plan to take concrete actions. We will strive to reach a wider audience by continuing to present culturally based workshops and events around campus. We will collaborate with non-MCC user groups in the hopes of building a stronger community that upholds the values of an inclusive climate. We will hold forums that give students the opportunity to voice their concerns to various organizations, such as events like “Speak Up, Reach Out” where students are encouraged to discuss pertinent issues, create lasting solutions and be proactive. All in all, we will encourage students to voice their opinions in order to maintain a positive, respectful and healthy community.</p>\n<p>We, as the MCC Council, believe that an inclusive campus and community climate is not only beneficial to diverse students but to the UCSB community as a whole. We hope the UCSB community is ready to work with the MCC Council to reach our goal. If we do not obtain this climate, UCSB loses the respect and prestige that we have all worked so hard to gain.</p>\n<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>\n<p><em>The MultiCultural Center Council</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>MCC Council Members’ Organizations:</em></p>\n<p><em>Akanke, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, American Indian Student Association, A.S.—S.C.O.R.E., Behind the Walls, BPRO, Black Quare, Black Student Union, Caribbean Student Collective, Chi Delta Theta Sorority, Chinese Student Association, Chinese Students and Scholars Assoc., El Congreso, Gamma Zeta Alpha, Hermanas Unidas Inc., Hermanos Unidos Inc., Hillel, Hong Kong Student Association, Iaorana te Otea, IDEAS, India Association, International Student Association, INDUS Club, Kapatirang Pilipino, Korean American Student Association, La Escuelita, Lambda Sigma Gamma, Lambda Theta Alpha Sorority, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Latino Business Association, LEAD, Los Ingenieros, MCDC, M.E.N.T.E., M.U.J.E.R., Muslim Student Association, NSBE, Nu Alpha Kappa, Pacific Islander Student Association, Pan African Student Union, Persian Student Group, Pilipino Graduation, Pi Alpha Phi Fraternity, Queer Asian Pacific Islander, Power Through Knowledge, Queer Student Union, Raagmala, Raices de Mi Tierra, Sigma Alpha Zeta, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Sigma Kappa Chi, Taiwanese Student Association, Thai Student Union, Theta Nu Kappa, U.S.E.U., Vietnamese Student Association, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/mcc-council-urges-students-strive-inclusive-campus-climate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/mcc-council-urges-students-strive-inclusive-campus-climate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/mcc-council-urges-students-strive-inclusive-campus-climate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/mcc-council-urges-students-strive-inclusive-campus-climate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/mcc-council-urges-students-strive-inclusive-campus-climate/","id":5985,"author":{"id":494,"name":"The Multicultural Center Council"},"related":[5984,5983,5982],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Romney, Obama and Trees: Environmentalism for the Next Four Years","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four debates — three presidential and one vice-presidential — and climate change has not been mentioned once.

During their debates the closest the presidential candidates got to addressing the catastrophic ecological crisis was jousting over the price of gasoline and one-upping each other about how much coal and oil each is going to extract. Even in last night’s globally-focused debate in Florida — ground zero for sea-level rise in the U.S. — climate change went ominously unmentioned in debates over America’s ability to project military power.</p>\n<p>Given the degree to which climate change has been screaming for attention in recent years in the form of extreme weather events, it is truly astonishing that Obama and Romney have managed to avoid the subject altogether. The number of “Major Disaster Declarations” by the federal government has doubled in the last 10 years, from 43 in 1991 to 99 in 2011. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2012 so far has seen the most extreme weather in recorded history throughout the contiguous U.S.: crippling droughts in some regions, extreme precipitation in others, uncontrollable wildfires, and the hottest January-August on record. Globally the picture is similar. The summer saw sea ice in the Arctic shrink to its smallest area ever, while flooding and drought plagued the planet from Bangkok to Brazil.</p>\n<p>Such calamities — and the fact that they may constitute a new normal for the planet — add a crucial, though almost completely ignored, dimension to Obama and Romney’s debates over the role of government. Since the State and the public sector (the central object of disagreement in this election) are the only entities with the power and scope to effectively mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, Romney and the GOP’s ongoing assault on the federal government has serious implications not just for the economy, but for the ecology of the planet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First, it is crucial to understand that the state will necessarily be central to any serious attempt to address the climate crisis. The federal government is the only body with the ability to regulate and prevent further greenhouse gas emissions and the only body with the capital and capacity to respond to current climate disasters. If elected, Romney and the GOP will quash these governmental powers and leave the American people — and the planet — at the mercy of a climate gyrating wildly out of control.</p>\n<p>Romney has sworn to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which he calls “a tool in the hands of the President to crush the private enterprise system.” He promises to revoke completely its already limited ability to regulate carbon emissions through the Clean Air Act. This drastic move will essentially guarantee an acceleration of the rate at which we inundate the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p>Once our ability to prevent further planetary warming has been emasculated, Romney and the GOP plan to take their federal budget wars to the few mechanisms we currently have to respond to climate disasters. They plan to strip the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of more than half of its budget, thereby radically curtailing our ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme weather events. Romney also wants to further downsize federal funds for first responders such as police and firefighters — who have been absolutely indispensable to dealing with this summer’s rampant wildfires.</p>\n<p>Along with these draconian cuts to much-needed disaster-response services, the Republicans’ proposed budget retains a decade’s worth of tax breaks and subsidies for Big Oil to the tune of $45 billion. Not that the oil industry needs the help. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies raked in more than $80 billion in profit while Exxon Mobil pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.</p>\n<p>The Republican platform not only dismantles our abilities to respond to and regulate future climate change, it even subsidies its production.</p>\n<p>While Obama’s recent silence about climate change has been regressive to say the least, he and the Democrats certainly offer a more forward-thinking energy policy than do Romney and the Republicans. Obama’s most important move to date on the climate change front has been to propose the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act — which, had it passed the Congress, would have cut billions of dollars of annual taxpayer subsidies to the top five American oil companies and would have freed up capital to invest in renewable sources.</p>\n<p>None of this much matters if you still deny that climate change is occurring like, say, Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan does. And he is not out of line with the Republican Party. In 2011, the GOP-led House of Representatives defiantly rejected a Democratic amendment calling for Congress to accept the scientific consensus that climate change is occurring, that it is caused in large part by human activity and that it is a threat to human health.</p>\n<p>The climate dimension raises the stakes of the struggles over the state and proves a Romney presidency to be a much more reckless play than previously thought.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick Sheehan is a fourth-year sociology major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/","id":5986,"author":{"id":468,"name":"Patrick Sheehan"},"related":[5985,5984,5983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Elected A.S.

In Spring Quarter 2012, The Bottom Line — TBL — tried to pass a new student fee which would give them the majority of their funding. It unfortunately failed, meaning the student body voted and decided not to fund TBL. After much frenzy in a Legislative Council meeting, the current leadership of TBL highlighted the fact that, “the show must go on,” meaning they would give up honoraria (which is a small compensation for those with positions in A.S.) for the entire committee, in order to keep the production of the paper. After a long deliberation, the 2011-2012 Legislative Council awarded TBL money for operation and production.</p>\n<p>Last week, TBL came to Finance Board requesting a sum around $22,000. For what you might ask? Travel expenses? Printing? Or maybe even updated equipment? No, this organization asked for $22,000 of student fees to compensate them financially after they had expressed that it was more crucial for the printing of the paper to continue rather than getting paid for their work. Finance Board decided to fund them around $12,000.</p>\n<p>Let me explain some of the more problematic issues with this request. One, the students had already voted to not fund TBL, and now they are using student fees to fund themselves in a VERY less public way. What about the transparency that A.S. claims to strive for? Two, $22,000 is the second largest honoraria budget, second to that of the Senate, who has more officers than TBL and is an elected position. Three, in previous Finance Board decisions this year, the precedent was not to fund for honoraria from the A.S. account. Finally, my fourth and probably most important point, wouldn’t the student population, that gave these fees to Finance Board, rather see their money spent on something that can benefit all students rather than just a particular group?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally, while the A.S. budget was being made for the current school year, the previous president had allocated $5,700 to TBL honoraria and advised them to move production online. Continuing with the deceit, while TBL was making their lack of transparency, they did not share this information with Finance Board, which is why they ended up getting the $12,000 instead of $5,700, which I feel is a more appropriate and logical allocation. Now that I have brought this forward to the public eye, I would like to see students react, in whichever way they see fit. Either in favor of this allocation of student fees, against this allocation or somewhere in between. We have voted on this once, now, let our voices be heard again.</p>\n<p><em>Alexandria Choate is a third-year political science major and Associated Students Off-Campus Senator.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/elected-member-expresses-concern-student-fund-allocations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/elected-member-expresses-concern-student-fund-allocations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/elected-member-expresses-concern-student-fund-allocations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/elected-member-expresses-concern-student-fund-allocations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/elected-member-expresses-concern-student-fund-allocations/","id":5987,"author":{"id":492,"name":"Alexandria Choate"},"related":[5986,5985,5984],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
