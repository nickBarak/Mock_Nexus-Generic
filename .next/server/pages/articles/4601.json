Community Relations Committee hosted their third potluck of the quarter titled “The Grazing Hour” Friday at the I.V. Co-op patio.</p>\n<p>The Grazing Hour featured organic food provided by the three organizations and participating attendees, and UCSB alumnus Conner Cherland played solo guitar and sang for music entertainment. The first-ever potluck was held earlier this quarter in September in an effort to build connections with I.V. residents by sharing healthy food.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen said the purpose of the event was to help connect I.V. residents through healthy eating habits.</p>\n<p>“I think that if folks have the ability to begin to interact with their neighbors, and begin to really use and work with the other neighbors, there’s a lot of potential to really be able to capitalize on that social capital and really be able to support one another in some way or another, in genuine way of figuring out and caring for one another,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>The event drew a crowd of around 70 to 80 people, according to Nguyen.</p>\n<p>“We might have reached 100; I think there was a moment where it was pretty packed in here,” Nguyen said. “I think that [the Grazing Hour] has continued to grow and we hope that it continues to grow as folks are hanging out and chilling.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66475\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2124948698\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66513\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66475\" data-attachment-id=\"66475\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/iv-food-co-op-potluck_vivian-bui-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"530,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447432573\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Food Co Op Potluck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66475\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=350%2C528\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Nguyen said she feels it is important for the Food Bank to reach out to the community.</p>\n<p>“We have engaged in some of these other activities in the community, just to kind of begin to engage folks in sharing food differently, and build some community beyond just our pantry,” Nguyen said. “So it was important for folks in our leadership to engage in something like this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said she hopes The Grazing Hour created a welcoming environment which Isla Vistans may not often experience.</p>\n<p>“As we expand … even if this creates some sense for someone who just walked by, and who now is just coming in for and seeing this event happen, and they have that sense of community for this moment and for this month, ” Nguyen said. “Even if it’s once a month that they’re a part of something, it’s important.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Ariana Richmond said the event connected her to other people in I.V. in a “chill” way.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a great community feel, beautiful music, and food. You always meet nice people,” Richmond said. “The food was good, it was so healthy.”</p>\n<p>Cherland said he was invited to play at the potluck after requesting to play on KCSB.</p>\n<p>“I worked for Tuyen when I was a student at UCSB, and I recently reached out to KCSB to see if I could play on the air, and Tuyen was the one that picked up the request,” Cherland said. “So I got to play [at KCSB] on Tuesday, and she asked me to play this as well.”</p>\n<p>Cherland said he enjoys events such as the potluck because it is more relaxed than the I.V. party scene.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of the community events, just because it’s calmer than a lot of the Isla Vista scenes, and as a freshman I would have liked to come to things like this, just where you can like chill out with your friends and relax,” Cherland said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Diego Rivera said his favorite part of the event was the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“I really like the ambience, the mood; it’s really relaxed. I feel like everyone here is really chill,” Rivera said. “I enjoyed myself; this is definitely something I’d like to do again.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_66474\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66474\" data-attachment-id=\"66474\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/iv-food-co-op-potluck_vivian-bui-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"530,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447432457\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Food Co Op Potluck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66474 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=530%2C800\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"530\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Porter declared his candidacy Monday due to encouragement from neighbors and community leaders according to a press release from his office. Porter is president of the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District School Board, Chairman of the Santa Ynez Valley Youth Coalition, a U.S. Army veteran and an Edward Jones financial advisor.</p>\n<p>According to Porter, 25 years in the Army and 15 years living in Santa Barbara County equip him with the necessary “tools” to improve the county.<br>\n“Why am I doing this? I think the biggest reason is I think I can make a difference,” Porter said.</p>\n<p>Porter said his role as an engineer for the Army required him to make judgments grounded in facts and reason rather than alignment with a belief system. According to Porter, this is the type of decision making that needs to take place in the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“In the Army I was apolitical, which taught me how to think not based on ideology, but how to think on what are the facts and figures and how do you make reasoned common sense decisions about how to move forward,” Porter said. “I think that’s exactly the kind of approach we need to take in our county as opposed to just making a decision based on ideology.”<br>\nPorter said his campaign will consist of two parts: hearing potential constituents’ concerns and proposing solutions.</p>\n<p>“Listening to people is going to be the first step. Number two is analyzing what I hear from people and really laying out a new direction for the different communities of the county and laying out how the county can help,” Porter said. “I’m making that a big, big, big part of my campaign.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he walked around Isla Vista on Halloween with Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown and talked with residents about their concerns. According to Porter, the County has been neglecting I.V.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that Isla Vista hasn’t received the appropriate amount of attention from the county,” Porter said. “I think a lot of the unfortunate events over the past year have been a culmination of that benign neglect, if you will. At least that was the sense I was getting, especially from the students, when talking to them on Halloween night.”</p>\n<p>Porter said he plans on meeting with I.V. residents, business owners, students and campus groups to become more familiar with issues concerning I.V. and UC Santa Barbara during his campaign.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, a challenge for me is going to be UCSB and Isla Vista and understanding their issues, because they are so different from where I live in Santa Ynez,” Porter said. “I want to come down and be able to talk to the community leaders there.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, the Third District has many types of constituent concerns and has more miles of California coastline than any other supervisorial district in the state. The District includes UCSB, the Los Padres National Forest, the Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Santa Ynez Valley Chumash population, with about 50 percent of its population residing outside city limits.</p>\n<p>Farr said these factors make Third District County Supervisor “more than a full-time job.”</p>\n<p>“We have a very large load of constituent issues that we’re working on throughout the district at any given point in time,” Farr said. “That probably makes the job of the Third District County Supervisor much more palpable and busy than probably any other district in our county.”</p>\n<p>Farr said the role of the Third District County Supervisor is especially important to I.V. residents because I.V. is an unincorporated area that cannot go to a city council and must rely strongly on its county representatives.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot going on and there’s a lot to learn and lot of decisions that the Board of Supervisors will impact on Isla Vista on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis,” Farr said. “The people in the community are going to require, or even demand, that their representative on the Board represent the interest there and advocate for them, as I have done.”</p>\n<p>Farr said Porter’s qualification for the office will become more apparent during the race.</p>\n<p>“It’s just the very beginning of the campaign, and as we move forward we’ll see how he responds to issues in the district and … where he is on various issues that are important to the Isla Vista community in particular,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are going to want a candidate who supports Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the framework for the creation of a unique Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. funded by a Utilities User Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>“I think that Isla Vista is going to be looking for a strong advocate of what the community wants, including AB 3,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said she hopes to learn candidates’ stances on issues such as AB 3, parking in I.V., the environment and I.V.’s Latino population.</p>\n<p>“I’d also like to learn more about their views on other social justice issues — things that I have taken very seriously in my role as EVPLA,” Dela Cruz said. “They are going to have a huge role in this because they are the voice of our community and they’re defending us at the county level.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she wants the future County Supervisor to have the same involvement with I.V. residents and UCSB students that Farr has had throughout her seven years in the office.</p>\n<p>“I would personally like to see this individual have the personal connection that Doreen Farr has had with us thus far in issues like AB 3 and other ongoing projects,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to I.V. Downtown Business Association vice president Jay Freeman, Porter might struggle to win votes from I.V. residents due to his military background despite being a strong candidate.</p>\n<p>“Bruce Porter is clearly a very strong and experienced candidate, but I think he will have an uphill battle here in Isla Vista,” Freeman said. “His ex-military background is impressive, but may turn off student voters.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said he advises students to follow the race closely because the support of the Board of Supervisors is crucial for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The large number of highly motivated student voters in Isla Vista should pay close attention to this election, particularly as we will likely see new entrants soon in this race,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of

It’s cheap,” Hothi said. “They always have good sales.”</p>\n<p>Spisla said it can be difficult for I.V. residents to reach retail stores that are several miles away since the majority rely on bicycles and skateboards for transportation.</p>\n<p>“[Amazon] was looking into the proximity of other locations where the general population can actually purchase items, what kind of retail stores are in this area as well, and we found that there’s not a lot around here,” Spisla said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics and music double major Nick DiPierro, an Amazon Student member, said having the pick-up point open on weekends will be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Our post office is closed on Saturdays and Sundays and closes at four,” DiPerro said. “Sometimes I’d like to be able to order things over the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Spilsa said she hopes the new pick-up will become a part of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to be the first site that’s actually off-campus, and to be able to be part of the community and build those relationships with the other businesses, meeting everyone that’s around this area, and working very closely with the students and general population that lives around here or works around here,” Spisla said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
