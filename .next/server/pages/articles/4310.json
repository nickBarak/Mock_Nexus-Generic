This is an uptick from last year’s estimated attendance of between 6,000 and 8,000 people.</p>\n<p>There were 56 citations, 25 arrests and 25 medical transports this year by both SBSO and the UC Police Department (UCPD), according to preliminary numbers from the Sheriff’s office. Both citation and arrest numbers dropped from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/\">last year’s</a> 68 citations and 42 arrests, but the number of medical transports jumped from 14 in 2017.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 650px; min-height: 520px; border: 1px solid grey;\" src=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/Deltopia_Prelim_2018.html\" width=\"800\" height=\"150\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe> </p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Phi Do / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>All 25 medical transports were drug and alcohol related. There was one incident involving an opioid-related overdose, during which SBSO administered Narcan.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, there were two separate cases where a partygoer fell off a balcony due to intoxication. Neither incident resulted in major injuries.</p>\n<p>Two of the arrests that occurred on Saturday involved <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-09/two-handguns-confiscated-over-deltopia-weekend/\">handguns</a>. In the first incident SBSO arrested Briton Barge, 23, after he allegedly used a 0.40 caliber pistol to threaten two victims while searching for his stolen backpack.</p>\n<p>SBSO also arrested Tristian Gilford, 24, after Gilford was pulled over for having “faulty lighting equipment” on his car. Police officers then found a .25 caliber pistol hidden inside of his car and arrested him.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO, the crowds began dwindling around 6 p.m. when the Outdoor Festival Ordinance, which bans any live or recorded music heard outside residences, went into effect. The crowds eventually dissipated when students left I.V. to attend The Warm Up concert at the Thunderdome sponsored by Associated Students Program Board.</p>\n<p>“This year we did see more out-of-towners, and we did obviously see an increase in medical transports,” Hoover said. “But for the most part, people were pretty respectful of law enforcement and there weren’t any major problems other than the medical transports we talked about.”</p>\n<p>According to arrest logs from April 5 to April 8, out-of-towners made up 49 percent of Deltopia arrests. Here’s a breakdown of all the arrests including age, gender and offense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 650px; height: 560px; border: 1px solid grey;\" src=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/Deltopia_Arrests_2018.html\" width=\"800\" height=\"150\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Phi Do / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>Most of the arrests occurred on Del Playa Drive, where law enforcement arrested 10 people.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1kbUj0bnkak9PTGpmRvHRllXED7STTLpj\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></center>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>Jay Freeman, director for the I.V. Community Services District (CSD), said that with the exception of several parking restrictions, it was “a day like any other.”</p>\n<p>The day after Deltopia festivities, 60 volunteers assembled at Adopt-A-Block’s annual Deltopia Cleanup Sunday morning to pick up 776 pounds of trash. According to Adopt-A-Block Supervisor Raymond Willefert, the amount of street waste he observed this year was similar to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia has certainly quieted down in the last few years, and fortunately we’re not seeing widespread trashing of the community and environment on the scale that was experienced prior to 2015,” Willefert said in an email.</p>\n<p>“There was a significant amount of trash on Del Playa Drive this morning when I got to work. The 6600 block in particular was hit pretty hard, but fortunately nothing we couldn’t handle,” he explained.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university spent between $25,000 and $30,000 on ads to deter out-of-towners from attending Deltopia. In previous years, the university has spent up to $40,000.</p>\n<p>The university also spent approximately $5,000 to put up fencing on El Colegio Road. The university faced backlash from students and the CSD regarding their decision to put up fencing this year, despite a formal request from the CSD to reconsider.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand said the CSD coordinated with local law enforcement and had a contract with the UCPD to deploy Community Service Officers (CSOs) during the day to help keep people safe.</p>\n<p>“I’m very glad that it was a relatively safe event,” Bertrand said. “On that note, I’m really happy to see a continued reduction in arrests and citations. However, I am concerned about this year’s increase in medical calls, and it just shows us how important it is to continue to work to make this event safer.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that moving forward, there should be considerations about creating a “more sustainable event,” which brings together locals, community organizations and businesses.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we have a bunch of people who are roaming around on Del Playa with no plans,” Bertrand said. “If we can bring some more fun and safe activities to Isla Vista on this day and really incorporate local businesses into it, I think that we can have a much safer and more positive event.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div

house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. <em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident was first </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/exb9tr/sigma_nu_is_disgusting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about to r/UCSantaBarbara, a subreddit for the UC Santa Barbara community, and was soon shared on various other UCSB social media spaces as well, including the Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Reddit post, the user wrote about attending a Sigma Nu house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He asked her if “her friend in the red(me) Is a [transgender woman] because someone at the door let a [transgender woman] in” and it was his job to go find her. My friend said no she’s not and that’s so fucked up [of] u guys to even ask,” the user wrote, referencing the slur that the fraternity member allegedly used to refer to a transgender woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then he apologized and showed her the SNU group [messages] where someone had asked “who the fuck let that [transgender woman] in” and something along the lines of “kick her out” then he replied saying “I found a girl I thought was her but she’s not it. I’ll keep searching”.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reddit user who posted about the incident did not respond to a message from a Nexus reporter asking for further information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir was the first to bring up the post at the meeting on Monday, noting that many students had approached her over the weekend about the post. Sir asked Interfraternity Council President Jason Stone what the council was doing to address the complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not actually aware of the details of that, but generally speaking, with regard to discrimination, it’s something we take seriously,” Stone said. “I’m absolutely ready to visit that as I’m able to understand that situation, but I’m not really aware of it right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), added that “notably our Greek leader retreat occurred this past weekend, so several leaders in the Greek community were actually not in Isla Vista during the weekend, so there’s some communication delay.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said his office had been notified about the post and had started to look into it, but was not aware of the poster’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alvarez stepped in to say that the Title IX office had also received a report about the incident, and had reached out to the user who made the Reddit post. She did not specify who made the report to the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve received some data and screenshots of some group chats so that is data we’re collecting, and we are trying to figure out what additional information is available and figure out next steps in our response,” Alvarez told the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the office feels like it has enough information to move forward, Alvarez said it will conduct an assessment to see if the report falls underneath either the nondiscrimination policy or the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t meet the criteria under those two policies, I’m unable to take action, but I will forward it then over to the Office of Student Life to potentially take action under additional codes,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said in an interview afterward that her office and several other offices had started looking into the incident, but since the only formal report was made to the Title IX office, that office is now in charge of the investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said at the meeting, however, that it’s difficult for the office to issue any disciplinary action in response to “speech infractions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Generally, even the most offensive speech is permitted by the law, and therefore [permitted by] our policy as a government organization,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we wind up in a position where we may not be able to hold a person accountable in terms of a change to their student status or a formal warning or something like that, but we do still have the opportunity as an institution to express our values, express our concern, to offer the voluntary education,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists President Kyremina Youssef touched upon the incident in a later discussion during the meeting about timely notifications to the community, saying that while many students had seen the post circulating on social media, they hadn’t heard anything from administrators.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said she and others wanted to see a statement from UCSB administrators in support of transgender students and offering resources to those affected by the post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like students are just waiting on UC administration to say something,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said after the meeting that while she believes it’s important to “let the student body know how we feel about this and our values,” a statement from the university would likely come in her monthly newsletter as opposed to a campus-wide email from the chancellor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating, when this happens,” Armistead said. “It’s just so against our values, and it’s hurtful.

His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V. CSD Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident received considerable local media coverage and Gelb faced widespread community backlash. Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed. He has not been present at any of the hearings. In February, his representation unsuccessfully filed to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Facebook group titled “Texts From Gelb,” I.V. residents share videos of Gelb’s public outbursts and screenshots of profane texts he had sent them. On Saturday, a user posted a video of Gelb using misogynistic slurs to tell residents not to sit on the roof of their complex. He also refers to the apparent sale of his properties, which he had been </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t need these fucking cunts falling off my roof, ruining my sale,” he says at one point in the video. “Tell that fucking whore to get off my goddamn roof!” he shouts at another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb declined the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s request for comment on the video.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he was frustrated the process has taken so long, but he won’t be deterred from seeing it through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ll continue to show up to these hearings for as long as I need to,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s important that when there’s an attack on members of the LGBTQ community, we stand up and say,
