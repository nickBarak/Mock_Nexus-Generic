T-Fresh as the winner of a spot on the main stage at Extravaganza 2014.</p>\n<p>After eight student DJs competed in Tuesday’s eight-bracket single-elimination round, local student DJs PsychoJohn, Dropwise, T-Fresh and Beta wave received the highest scores and were slated to move on to the final round. However, a last minute disqualification of DJ duo PsychoJohn bumped DJ Angarola up to last night’s final competition at the Hub.</p>\n<p>The first round of last night’s performances featured Angarola against Beta wave and T-Fresh against Dropwise. Judged based on mixing ability, song selection, originality and energy response, DJs Angarola and T-Fresh competed in the final head-to-head round with T-Fresh emerging victorious.</p>\n<p>According to Fish, last night’s victory fulfilled his longtime wish to play at an event featuring big-time headliner acts such as rappers Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar.</p>\n<p>“I’m speechless,” Fish said. “It’s been a dream since I was a freshman to be able to play an event like Extravaganza. Now with this coming true on my senior year, it’s just an incredible feeling.”</p>\n<p>Fish said last night’s Battle of the DJs served as a stepping stone allowing him to bring his talent from Isla Vista backyards to the big stage.</p>\n<p>“The set meant so much to me. I felt like it was the best set of my life,” Fish said. “There was so much energy and I was so into it because I wanted it so bad. Words can’t explain. I’m going to start my set now.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year biochemistry major Brian Kasimov, a.k.a. Dropwise, despite all the competing DJs’ differences in style, technique and personality, Battle of the DJs allowed peers with a “common goal” to come together and share their music with the student body.</p>\n<p>“It feels really good ‘cause all three other people who played tonight are my really good friends, so no matter what a great person is going win,” Kasimov said. “We’re all here to support each other … I like that it’s a healthy competitive spirit.”</p>\n<p>Third-year microbiology major and event-attendee Brett Russell criticized the judge’s choices, claiming Angarola generally had a greater “variety of beat,” even as he played a “solid six minutes of straight Disclosure with pop songs mixed on top.”</p>\n<p>“Angarola made me gig in ways I haven’t experimented with before, and with T-fresh, I really felt the need to sarcastically dance by simply standing in place and pumping my arms up and down,” Russell said. “Although T-fresh’s Space Jam mix was by far the best song I heard of the whole night … in general, during his set, I felt like I was in 2010.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. Program Board publicity coordinator and third-year communication and film &amp; media studies major Karen Masumoto, T-Fresh rightfully won first place by bringing “great energy” to the event, showcasing his widely-liked, well-versed talent. Masumoto said the event went swimmingly and has prompted Program Board to continue doing an annual Battle of the DJs from now on.</p>\n<p>“T-Fresh was awesome! He really got the crowd going,” Masumoto said. “It’s cool to see everyone in the music scene come together to support each other.”</p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-54120-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-3rd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1491%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54121\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (3rd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-4th-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1504%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54122\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (4th) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-1st-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54123\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (1st) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/DJ-photo-2nd-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C791\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54124\",\"title\":\"DJ photo (2nd) Kenneth Song\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p>Photos by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/t-fresh-wins-first-ever-battle-of-djs-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/t-fresh-wins-first-ever-battle-of-djs-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/t-fresh-wins-first-ever-battle-of-djs-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/t-fresh-wins-first-ever-battle-of-djs-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/t-fresh-wins-first-ever-battle-of-djs-competition/","id":3051,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3050,3049,3048],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet explained the unusual situation in an email.</p>\n<p>“Due to the fact that the agenda didn’t get sent out to the list servers on time, we are conducting a phone vote this week so we aren’t breaking the Brown Act,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>During Public Forum, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming presented to the Senate further details about the meningitis vaccine UCSB will offer in the Recreation Center for a two-week period starting this Monday. According to Flemming, acquiring the vaccine required the cooperation of around 150 administrators and other staff.</p>\n<p>“This is a pretty extraordinary effort that’s underway right now,” Fleming said. “There are probably about 150 people from campus working on this — probably about 30 of them working full time to make this happen.”</p>\n<p>Fleming addressed concerns regarding side effects of the vaccine, citing a recent case in which the vaccine was administered to a large number of people with no serious repercussions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know about the countries, but Princeton is probably the best example recently. We understand that they gave close to six thousand and they didn’t have any significant adverse reactions, except for just a sore arm and a few students fainted,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Later, A.S. President Jonathan Abboud informed the Senate on the expected cost of the meningitis vaccine and ways to mitigate its financial impact on any particular department.</p>\n<p>“The estimated cost of the meningitis vaccine for everybody is two million dollars,” Abboud said. “There’s no set place approved to pay for it yet … we want to spread the costs a little bit, because faculty get meningitis too, they are with us everyday.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also discussed a proposed Associated Students food cart in the University Center, saying it would benefit many students.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can actually have an A.S. run food service like most A.S.’s have, and we can give students experience running a business,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a brief presentation in which he said he was working to get the architect of the new development planned for I.V. known as “The Nest” to speak at next weeks Senate meeting and answer questions from the public.</p>\n<p>“I know he said he wanted to speak to students about it, so I told him this would be a great opportunity to speak to a bunch of students,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Also during the meeting, the UCSB Investment Advisory Committee presented to the Senate its plans to reinvest a portion of its funding into the bank Barclay’s and 10-year Mexican treasury bonds as a response to projected higher interest rates in the near future.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed at the meeting included a new student literary arts magazine titled The Catalyst that will accept work from students of all majors and ages, A.S. funding for a planned Persian New Years event with authentic Persian food, a proposal to commission a mural at the I.V. Community Center at Pardall and the Battle of the Bands concert that will be held next Wednesday at the Hub at 6:30pm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54126\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54126\" data-attachment-id=\"54126\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/as-senate-kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C793&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1501,793\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1392843783\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate Kenneth Song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=888%2C469&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54126\" alt=\"Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands. \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song-1024x540.jpg?resize=610%2C321\" width=\"610\" height=\"321\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The lecture, “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” has inspired a number of similar ‘last lecture’ series at other universities, including UCSB’s very own series, according to one of the organizers of the event, Angela Lau, a third-year economics and accounting major. UCSB’s “Last Lecture” series began three years ago with a presentation by psychology professor Alan Fridlund, who spoke about his academic and personal life with a retrospective lens.</p>\n<p>Every year, students nominate a professor to speak. According to second-year psychology major and Spanish minor Sarah Breslaw, who helped organize the event alongside other students in A.S., the nomination is reached by an inclusive, democratic process held solely by the students.</p>\n<p>“It’s all based on voting. We sent out a mass email to all students a few months back, requesting that they [choose] which professor they’d prefer to give their most meaningful lecture ever,” Breslaw said. “From there, the top three are picked out, and we personally ask them if they would be interested.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kennedy — who won the nomination “hands-down” according to Breslaw — said he feels honored to speak this year and suggested that his selection comes from the way he tries to introduce students to new ideas during class time.</p>\n<p>“I would imagine it has something to do with the messages I present in the larger classes I teach and how they provide new insights about language to students that they [personally] would have never thought of before,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Although he has not yet chosen a title for his last lecture, Kennedy said he knows what the content of his presentation will be.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be talking about the kinds of big picture messages that we can get from paying attention to details about things and subjects that we love,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Wednesday, February 26, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/","id":3053,"author":{"id":186,"name":"Jessy Diamba"},"related":[3052,3051,3050],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
