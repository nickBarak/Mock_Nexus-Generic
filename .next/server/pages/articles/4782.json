IVTU held a meeting earlier this week, seen here, about the situation. <i>Daily Nexus File Photo</i></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V. Friday at 1 p.m. to protest the eviction of six households from their apartments at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The march is part of IVTU’s three-day “Tenants Re-Claiming Isla Vista” <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/\">campaign</a> created to amass support for evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas whose renovated units underwent an alleged 50 percent rent increase. The campaign aims to urge Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the management company working for Abrego Villas’ property owners, to pay the tenants’ relocation benefits, required under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said the march has been organized to promote justice for the evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas and to inspire further legislative action to prevent future unjustified evictions in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are requesting that Majestic Asset Management pay the tenants the relocation benefits that they rightly deserve but have not yet received,” Bogdanov said. “We would like to show to the legislatures on the county and statewide levels that Isla Vista is in need of legislative reforms and improvements to strengthen tenant variety as well as to improve the housing situation in I.V.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities. – IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bogdanov said the march is also intended to educate and unite all tenants renting spaces in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Lack of knowledge on the part of the tenants about their rights in housing issues is a big problem in Isla Vista and … affects all members of the community,” Bogdanov said. “The only way we can create a real difference is by becoming more educated and uniting to demand better housing.”</p>\n<p>California Assemblymember for Santa Barbara Das Williams said he supports the IVTU’s campaign and that without their action there would be little knowledge of the issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think that if they weren’t doing something that we might not even know about it,” Williams said. “I hope they will continue to engage the owners in a respectful and civil manner as something that might actually provide some benefits for the families that were involved.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said this is not a one-time issue but rather the latest in a series of evictions of low-income residents, primarily Latino families, in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to rally the community support and raise awareness about the fact that these housing issues are recurring, and ongoing” Bogdanov said. “We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities.”</p>\n<p>President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak said the property owner of Abrego Villas is responsible for the evictions that violated Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, not Majestic Asset Management, LLC.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenants in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts. – President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic Asset Management, LLC plans to present an argument in defense of the company in court.</p>\n<p>“We intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said, “We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes Majestic Asset Management, LLC should pay the tenants the relocation benefits he thinks they deserve.</p>\n<p>“In my mind either they should comply because they are required to do so, or because it is the right thing to do. Either way it was the intent of the county ordinance to cover situations like this,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said evictions such as these can be a result of maximization of rent returns by all I.V. landlords, which can create discrimination problems in I.V. against low-income residents.</p>\n<p>“The diversity of having families a part of Isla Vista is something that can mitigate some of the public safety concerns,” Williams said. “The most interesting, the most safe, and the most thriving neighborhoods are ones that have demographic diversity, and one of the challenges we have in Isla Vista is increasing demographic concentration.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/","id":4782,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4781,4780,4779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk","biography":"Not available","articles":[2782,2810,2859,4782,4802],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"IVTU Holds Campaign For Evicted I.V.

According to former tenant Maria Hernandez, she was not notified of the eviction until two days before the deadline. <em>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) hosted a housing forum titled “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” at the Pardall Center in I.V. yesterday in order to gather attention and support for households evicted from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The forum was the first event in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/\">a three-day campaign</a> to fight for relocation benefits of six long-term, low income residents who were evicted without justification from their apartments at Abrego Villas on Abrego Rd. in late August 2014. The forum included a presentation from IVTU representatives and a Q&amp;A session with the evicted tenants.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, if five or more residencies are evicted from a property within 90 days, the management company is required to provide financial support in the form of “relocation benefits.”</p>\n<p>Following their evictions, the apartments were allegedly renovated and the rent price increased by 50 percent. The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and IVTU sponsored lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to Majestic, the property managers refused to grant them benefits and the tenants then challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors. In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day. – IVTU adviser and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>Subsequent evictions have taken place over 90 days after the initial six evictions, which IVTU believe is part of an effort to avoid further requests for relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>Brian Lezak of Majestic Asset Management, LLC said the company is not directly responsible for the evictions, and that the property owner did not break any rules.</p>\n<p>“Majestic Asset Management, Inc. is not the owner of Abrego Villas, only the management company,” Lezak said. “The ownership complied with the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and therefore did not violate any laws.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said the facts have not been plainly presented, and that Majestic is prepared to defend the owner of Abrego Villas.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said. “We will defend their position in court, which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said Majestic supports IVTU’s purpose, but maintains the company did not violate any regulations.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenant’s in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<p>IVTU advisor and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the event represents an “opportunity for truly engaged community dialogue” on issues relevant to students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors,” said Jones. “In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, while there are laws in place to protect renters, the law does not require property owners to provide any justification for evictions.</p>\n<p>“The laws do not protect folks from just being evicted,” said Jones. “The property owners have a right, if you will, to evict without any just cause.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major and IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov said issues affecting some I.V. residents should be minded by every student who lives in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We believe that fair housing opportunities are for all, and all residents of Isla Vista should unite together to fight for this,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60267\" style=\"width: 610px\"

case will go to small claims court, where the tenants will ask that a superior court judge hear the case in order to bring more attention to their allegedly unjustified evictions.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista Tenants Union has sponsored and proved the tenants with a very qualified lawyer who has decided to take on their case,” Bogdanov said. “They have not broken any clauses in their lease in order to be served that eviction notice.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said in a series of <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">2013 evictions from 781 Embaradero Del Norte</a>, the tenants were served eviction documents in English, which they were then pressured to sign, despite some tenants’ inability to understand English.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tenants were tricked into waiving their rights,” Bogdanov said. “Some of the tenants were only Spanish speaking and some of the landlords tricked them into signing waivers of their rights which were in English.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said the tenants most recently evicted in October were not offered any justification for their evictions.</p>\n<p>“The tenants were originally very confused, because when they were served eviction notices, the eviction notices did not provide the explanation.”</p>\n<p>Maria Hernandez, a long-term resident and single mother, said she lived in the Abrego Villas for 11 years before receiving her eviction notice. According to Hernandez, she did not receive word of the eviction until two days before the deadline for them to leave.</p>\n<p>“I came to the United States for a better future,” Hernandez said, “We are paying our rent, we are working … I don’t know why we are being discriminated against.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she did not have time to find adequate housing after finding out about the eviction.</p>\n<p>“I went to sleep in a church,” Hernandez said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60229\" style=\"width: 462px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60229\" data-attachment-id=\"60229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/tenants_anna-kodelashvili-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=2464%2C1632&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2464,1632\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"18\",\"credit\":\"Picasa\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422470726\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=452%2C300\" alt=\"Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus\" width=\"452\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=2464&amp;ssl=1 2464w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Anna-Kodelashvili-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Upon eviction, owners told Hernandez she would receive her security deposit if the apartment was clean and if she cooperated with the eviction request, but wound up being denied a portion of the deposit, she said.</p>\n<p>“We left everything clean and they still took money from the deposit,” Hernandez said. “They gave back 70 or 75 dollars.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez had also lived at the Abrego Villas for 11 years before her eviction and said her daughter was pregnant at the time of the eviction.

Clinic building, where I.V. residents, students and administrators <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-16/community-examines-history-of-i-v-self-governance/\">continued a discussion</a> that has been taking place over the last several months regarding the establishment of self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Demographics, parking issues, legislative challenges and uncertainty surrounding I.V.’s exact population were among the issues discussed during Tuesday’s forum. The meeting is one in a series that Williams will host, with the next town hall meeting to continue the I.V. self-governance discussion scheduled for Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said there are difficulties involved with researching I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“I think there are going to be hidden populations that are difficult to count,” Thurlow said. “There very well could be hangers on, which are people who have gone to school here and they’re just kind of off the radar and they’re just hanging out here.”</p>\n<p>According to Thurlow, some I.V. residents live in garages and split bedrooms, a situation not accounted for in typical census counting.</p>\n<p>“There’s the situation that one of my students explained,” Thurlow said. “She lives in three-bedroom house with two people living in the garage and two people living in each bedroom. And that’s not showing up in the census data.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista. – I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thurow said one suggestion is to use student researchers to calculate I.V. demographics.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking to [UCSB sociology professor] Victor Rios about having his spring class do a door-to-door survey in Isla Vista just to get a demographic number,” Thurow said. “Right now what we’re trying to do is use students to figure out as close as possible how many people really live in Isla Vista and who they are.”</p>\n<p>I.V Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member Pegeen Soutar said she is concerned with the impacted parking situation in I.V and how the Campus 880 Apartments have contributed to the issue.</p>\n<p>“Now some of the property owners, even though they’re now being required to provide parking for their housing that they’re building, they’re charging for it,” Soutar said. “And so what we found when 880 went up, because you just threw three or four hundred people in, all of a sudden all those cars showed up to fill our little park parking lot and the entire neighborhood around there got even more impacted and the parking lot is sitting only partially full.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said paid permits for parking on the street in I.V. was previously suggested to solve the congested parking but was denied by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency that regulates and protects beach access to the public.</p>\n<p>“Years ago we tried it and it was going to be Isla Vista-wide and the thought was maybe it would be 50 dollars a year to help facilitate and run the program so we wouldn’t have to go after a grant or anything like that,” Soutar said. “The problem that happened with that parking plan was the Coastal Commission.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the Coastal Commission had concerns that parking permits would prohibit public access to the beach.</p>\n<p>“The Coastal Commission was like, ‘Hey if you need a permit to park in Isla Vista how are you gonna access the beach,” Souter said.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the parking problem needs to be addressed so that residents can find safe parking places near their homes.</p>\n<p>“Women come back from work at 11 o’clock, waitressing downtown or whatever it is, and they have to park four blocks away and walk through Isla Vista,” Soutar said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets. – Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz</p></blockquote>\n<p>Local business owner Jay Freeman said the high cost of parking permits on campus can also be problematic because it causes first-year students to park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As far as UCSB is concerned, freshman don’t really have cars because they have a process for buying permits to store cars as freshman,” Freeman said, “When you look at the permit numbers for that, virtually no one is using that process. Instead, if they’re bringing cars, they must be putting them somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator Paola De La Cruz said she agrees that many students avoid parking fees by leaving their car on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“That’s exactly what my friends would do while they were living in FT,” De la Cruz said. “It was really expensive to pay for the parking so they would park on the streets.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said students should be included in the planning process to address I.V. parking.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to see programs that offered scholarships or prizes to people who develop the best new traffic system in Isla Vista, including parking, including bike lanes,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“At that point you get five or six different proposals in front of you and as a community we can see what we really like . . . it provides an opportunity for students involved.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a representative from Williams’ office, said concrete plans must be added to AB-3, the I.V. self-governance bill proposed by Williams in the California State Assembly, which needs to be amended to include definite plans for a local government.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely have to amend the bill by mid-March in order to keep it alive or else it just goes away because now the language that’s in there can’t even be assigned to a committee,” Elliott said. “The legislature couldn’t even vote on it right now because it would do nothing . . . We could park it in a committee for however long we need.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Associated Students Pardall Center will play host to a variety of events this week as part of the first-ever Isla Vista Week, hosted by the Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its first-ever Isla Vista Week from Monday through Friday to educate students and community members about I.V.’s history and issues involving I.V. environment, housing, community and more.</p>\n<p>The event series will begin Monday afternoon with an on-foot tour of I.V. led by IVCRC and will end Friday night with I.V. First Friday, an entertainment event typically held on the first Friday of each month of the academic year. Other events include an environment and sustainability presentation by A.S. Recycling on Tuesday, a family craft and community art project on Wednesday and a student housing forum hosted by the Isla Vista Housing Coalition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and fourth-year political science major Daniela Bayon said the events are aimed at building a community that cares about prominent issues currently surrounding I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to bring students, families and community members together through a variety of different relationships, events, and programs,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, IVCRC wants to expand their community involvement beyond their annual Pardall Carnival and Chilla Vista events, which are held annually in Fall and Spring quarters respectively.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista. I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket. – Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major</p></blockquote>\n<p>“It became our goal as a committee to do more, and to really focus on issue-based activism,” Bayon said. “It’s really come out of this concept to bring awareness to issues in Isla Vista and address them with community members who are already working on things.”</p>\n<p>Bayon said the housing forum is the start of IVCRC’s plan to eventually create a press release to be presented to university administration with a list of demands concerning what organizers call the current housing crisis in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want to hear from the average student at UCSB that struggles with housing,” Bayon said. “A lot of the advisers on the Chancellor’s Housing Committee don’t grasp the idea that there is a housing crisis, so our goal is to raise awareness through this forum and the stories of some of these students to UCSB administration.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and a second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major, said the alleged housing crisis in I.V. is a prevalent issue facing all students living off-campus.</p>\n<p>“I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Melgoza said in an email. “I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she hopes the Thursday forum at the Pardall Center will allow students to share their personal experiences with housing in I.V. and prompt collective action toward addressing housing issues.</p>\n<p>“It will be an open dialogue in which any issues may be brought up,” Melgoza said in an email. “I hope that with our collected efforts we can find a solution to give students and families affordable housing, knowledge on their rights as tenants, and put a stop to evictions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Julia Swensen, who will be attending I.V. Week, said she is confident IVCRC will succeed in improving the I.V. community through this week’s series of events.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really liked the past events that IVCRC has put on, and they’ve done a good job of educating the community about the things we don’t know about Isla Vista,” Swensen said.</p>\n<p>Bayon said that she hopes this is the first of many such events to continue the process of building community relationships in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We just really want to build the sense of community that cares about each other through these resources and networks, especially in light of what happened last spring on May 23rd, I think the community is looking for a healing project … something new we can build together to contribute to Isla Vista,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named Daniela Bayon IVCRC special events coordinator. She is actually the external chair for the committee.
