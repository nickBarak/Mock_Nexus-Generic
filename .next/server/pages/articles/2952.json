This resolution calls for Senate to get the University of California Board of Regents to develop a plan to divest university funds currently invested in gun manufacturing industries by May 2015 and to execute this plan by December 2015.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Sydney Chanu read a letter on behalf of Bob Weiss, father of May 23 Isla Vista shooting victim Veronika Weiss. In the letter, Weiss condemned the alleged connection between the UC and gun manufacturers. </p>\n<p>“As parents of a victim of gun violence murder at University of California, it sickens us that the university could be invested in firearm manufacturers,” Chanu read, “With over 30,000 gun related deaths every year, and school shootings occurring almost monthly, the gun industry has blood on its hands.”</p>\n<p>Weiss also stated that it is vital students take a stance against gun violence as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>“University of California should act as a leader and ban investments in the gun industry,” Chanu read, “me and my wife ask you to divest now.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president Krishna Hammond also spoke in support of the bill and said students should investigate the amount of investments the university has tied in gun manufacturing industries.</p>\n<p>“It’s unconscionable that not only could we be financially tied to the gun industry that is directly responsible, but also that we don’t even know how much money were in the hole is,” Hammond said. </p>\n<p>Hammond also said students should urge the UC Regents to reevaluate their values in regard to where they invest their funds. </p>\n<p>“Frankly, it’s unimaginable that the Regents and the administration seems to operate as a Black Ops,” Hammond said. “[They are] invested in extremely negative industries and endeavors. I’m just here to help and ask all of you to vote to divest.”</p>\n<p>In addition, DJ Club president Easton Konn said A.S. misinformed him about A.S. Ticket Office logistics, resulting in the club’s denial of funds for transportation to their Waka Flocka Flame and IAmSu! concert at the Earl Warren Showground this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve been happy using A.S. Ticketing. I think it’s a great system. I had no issue with it, neither did anyone in my organization,” Konn said. “The only issue is we were never told that we had to use it. We were actually told the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Konn, without A.S. funding for buses he will have to deny thousands of students transportation to Saturday’s concert. </p>\n<p>“It’s just really upsetting right now because we have a thousand people on the line, depending on these buses,” Konn said. “I have no idea how to go to all these kids tomorrow and tell them that they can’t get to this concert. I don’t know how to tell them they don’t have buses.”<br>\nSenator and Chairman of the Finance Board Jimmy Villarreal said miscommunication occurred between the DJ Club and A.S., but that regardless he did know if A.S. should fund the buses at all. </p>\n<p>“The initial presentation was basically, ‘Well we don’t want all these kids drunk driving, so let’s get a bus for them.’ We’re paying for those buses,” Villarreal said. “Do we want to be kind of complicit with all these drunk kids going somewhere in the first place? That’s just a lot of liability that maybe we don’t want to be a part of.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article mistakenly stated the meeting took place on Tuesday, though the intended day was Wednesday.

The event involves male members of various Greek Life organizations competing for the title of Mr. Greek Universe. The event fell under scrutiny by some members of the finance board.</p>\n<p>The first objector to the re-allocation of funding for the event came from Senator Steven Kwok who raised the issue of whether or not the planned desserts were in line with A.S. regulations regarding the funding of sustainable food.</p>\n<p>“My issue with the desserts is that they are primarily going to spend it on brownies from Costco,” Kwok said. “That does not meet the Green Bill to the best of my knowledge, so I don’t think we should be funding that portion of the re-allocation. Fifty percent of the food that you buy has to be from sustainable sources.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said she took issue with the possible exclusivity of the event.</p>\n<p>“The only people allowed to compete are Greek so if they’re getting money, that seems unfair,” Blant said. “Is there any way that stipulates that any and all competitions have to be all inclusive?”</p>\n<p>Senator Casey Firenze disagreed with Blant and said that if an event is open to all students as spectators, that is enough to qualify it for student funding, regardless of whether or not event participation is inclusive or not.</p>\n<p>“I just want to say about the whole Greek system thing, I thought that we were in agreement that if anyone can come watch it, it’s fine,” Firenze said. “And anyone can come watch.”</p>\n<p>Blant contended and said that an event that is open is not necessarily open enough.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, just open to attend is not inclusive enough,” said Blant.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Jasmine Moses said she was personally offended by Blant’s suggestion to not fund events primarily targeting a Greek community audience because of her membership in Greek Life organizations.</p>\n<p>“The way in which you said [that Mr. Greek Universe should not be funded], it made me feel some type of way because I am in the Greek community,” Moses said.<br>\nAfter discussion, the Board passed a motion granting the re-allocation of $160 for food and desserts, but not for sashes or a crown.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association requested $1,100 to hold a dating game show event in Corwin Pavilion. According to CSSA representatives, the matchmaking event would feature several singles answering questions about their relationship goals in front of an audience and being assigned potential dates.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Kherishma Shah did not approve of the event, questioning its value to the overall student population.</p>\n<p>“Personally I don’t see how this event would benefit UCSB in any way possible,” Shah said. It’s pretty much watching people, like, meet, that’s all it is.”<br>\nFinance Officer Jerel Constantino supported funding the CSSA’s event and said the Finance committee is responsible for financing events for a diverse range of students with different cultural backgrounds and entertainment preferences.</p>\n<p>“We all know this event is catered toward the international community, right? And I don’t know about you guys but my mom is from an East Asian country, this show is familiar to me,” Constantino said. “I think for us to tell [CSSA] this isn’t entertainment, that’s kind of ripping on their culture. It might not be fun for you, but it’s fun for the Chinese students who show up, who are also paying into student fees and who are also part of this community.”<br>\nThe Finance Board eventually approved $844 in funding for CSSA’s event.</p>\n<p>A Community Affairs Board request for $230 in re-allocation for buying toys for children living in Storke Family Housing and $1,850 funding request for toys for local children by the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity also sparked debate among the members of the committee.</p>\n<p>Finance Officer Haley Ferrera proposed that both initiatives come with a stipulation that the funding be used for purchasing gender-neutral toys.<br>\nChief Finance Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus objected on the basis that if the committee required the stipulation, it would be overstepping its bounds as a purely financial organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m all down for gender-neutral toys, but I feel like a lot of our personal beliefs on things is kind of getting pushed on these groups and their organizations. Like a male beauty pageant is hella bad in some spaces, they find that very heteronormative,” Theus said. “If we start with one group, I feel like we have to start doing an inclusivity check on all events. That’s a precedent we will have to start following.”</p>\n<p>Both CAB and Sigma Chi Omega were granted their requests with a recommendation, but not stipulation, from A.S. asking that funds be used for gender-neutral toys.</p>\n<p>Other notable motions passed included $1,970 in funding to the Swing and Ballroom Dancing Club for an event winter quarter, $3,200 to La Familia de Colores for plane tickets to an LGBTQ event in Denver and $3,000 to the Women’s Club Soccer team to help cover expenses related to participating in a national championship tournament in Memphis.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-59711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of UCSB Philosophy Department.</p></div>\n<p>Graduate student Jason Andrew Bennett, a fifth-year doctoral student in philosophy, died on Dec. 31 after committing suicide at age 32.</p>\n<p>Bennett received his Bachelors and Masters degrees in philosophy from UC Santa Cruz and enrolled at UCSB in 2010, where he earned a second Masters degree and became a Ph.D candidate with the philosophy department. Bennett’s primary research interests included the intersection between language logic and the limits of linguistic expression. Bennett also left a suicide note on his blog “<a href=\"http://notes.dedicto.org/the-note\">de dicto</a>“<strong> </strong>along with a lengthier post attached to the note providing instructions on how to distribute his possessions, including a number of paintings he created and posted to his blog.</p>\n<p>Philosophy Department Chair Thomas Holden said Bennett’s death was unexpected and that Bennett was a bright student and respectable person.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be holding a faculty memorial to share stories about Jason soon,” Holden said. “He was a brilliant student. He really was. He was a little quiet guy, very dignified and respectful. He was a stand-up guy … We’ll miss him.”</p>\n<p>Nathan Salmon, graduate student adviser for the department of philosophy, said Bennett was among the most talented students of philosophy that has been seen in the department.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s fair to say that I’ve never known a graduate student with more raw ability in philosophy than he had,” Salmon said. “And I’ve known many who are very, very talented. He was right up there in terms of raw talent. That was obvious really, from the start. He was very humble … to the point where people didn’t realize quite how talented he was.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett had a rough childhood and had “overcome extreme adversity.”</p>\n<p>“He grew up in an abusive home and he ran away from home at age 16,” Salmon said. “But he had to leave behind his younger siblings — he wasn’t old enough to take care of them himself. He really wasn’t even able to take care of himself.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett never gave any indication that he was tormented about his past and that his death took everyone by surprise.</p>\n<p>“By all appearances it looks as if he had completely overcome it,” Salmon said. “He was so capable. He just looked like he had a very promising future ahead of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Salmon, Bennett’s blog post on his website “de dicto” on Dec. 31 makes clear that he put time and thought into the decision before taking his life.</p>\n<p>“His suicide message was very methodical, very well-planned and thoughtful,” Salmon said. “It was clearly something he had been thinking about for quite some time. He took all of the kind of precautions and measures to make it easier for people who survived him to deal with his death and donated his body to UC San Francisco Medical School.”</p>\n<p>Salmon said that while graduate students are commonly under pressure, he does not believe Bennett’s death is a result of an insecurity about his studies.</p>\n<p>“I think it would be a mistake to conclude that he was under the kind of depression that comes from insecurity, not feeling that he wasn’t valued enough from his teacher,” Salmon said. “He knew his teachers thought very well of him and expected good things from him. He knew he was impressive to them, so it was probably something else. He didn’t talk to anyone about what tormented him.”</p>\n<p>According to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Janet Osimo, people who commit suicide often think about the decision for a long period of time and see no other alternatives. She also said childhood trauma can affect individuals long after the events occur and that some individuals have a genetic predisposition to depression.</p>\n<p>“For them they see it as that they’ve tried everything and that people that they leave behind will be better off,” Osimo said. “A lot of times a reason that they want to be dead is so they can be out of pain. Past traumatic events can absolutely effect individuals long after they’ve happened and some people may be more prone to depression through family genetics.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people feeling depressed or having suicidal thoughts should talk to someone or reach out to a suicide hotline, 911 or use the 24/7 CAPS counseling number.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times people wait until they’re in crisis to seek help” Osimo said. “Research shows that it’s better to seek help sooner, your symptoms will alleviate faster and stay away longer. However, if someone is facing a crisis and feeling like they want to end their life, they should call a suicide hotline or dial 911 for immediate help.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-14/ucsb-grad-student-jason-bennett-dies-at-32/","id":2950,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2949,2948,2947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Food Truck Cinema To Provide Free Food, Movie","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB First will host Food Truck Cinema tomorrow at 7:30p.m. on the UCen Lawn to advocate student donation to the university after graduation.

Hamner said philanthropy is essential to helping raise UCSB’s national ranking.</p>\n<p>“We really encourage students to give back to the school once they graduate,” Hamner said. “Even if a student gives one dollar or five dollars, it ups our ranking because it shows alumni involvement.”</p>\n<p>According to Fenton, UCSB First will also use Food Truck Cinema as a platform to announce the senior class gift, which was voted upon by members of this year’s senior class. The winning result, Fenton said, will determine which of three options on the ballot will have a fund opened on its behalf at the end of the school year: Associated Students Food Bank, A.S. Academic Resource Fund or the Student Safety Enhancement Fund.</p>\n<p>“[A senior class gift] is an opportunity for seniors to create a legacy and stay connected with their alma mater,” Fenton said. “UC Santa Barbara is a strong community, and giving to this gift demonstrates our firm belief in Gauchos helping Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>UCSB First is also partnering with the Associate Students Food Bank by recommending that attendees bring canned food donations to the event, according to A.S. Food Bank coordinator and alumna Tuyen Nguyen.</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said 10 percent of the proceeds from the food trucks will also go to A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“If there is something in the back of your pantry that you are willing and able to part with, it could always be used to help other students who utilize our pantry,” Nguyen said. “We also encourage [buying food] in whatever capacity people can engage and be able to give back.”</p>\n<p>Food Truck Cinema, Fenton said, will also be hosting tabling from various student organizations like Dance Marathon, Active Minds, DJ Club and the Education Abroad Program.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to provide more fun things for students to do,” Fenton said. “This is an opportunity for students to learn more about their campus and where they can get involved in.”</p>\n<p>According to Hamner, deciding what movie to screen was a difficult decision due to factors like appropriateness and popularity.</p>\n<p>“It actually took such a long time to pick a movie because we wanted to do a film that everyone would like and be able to relate to,” Hamner said.</p>\n<p>In the end, “Anchorman” was the right choice, according to Fenton.</p>\n<p>“We thought it was a fun movie and kind of nostalgic to most people,” Fenton said. “Plus everyone loves Will Ferrell.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the event would provide free food to attendees. That is incorrect, food will be sold.
