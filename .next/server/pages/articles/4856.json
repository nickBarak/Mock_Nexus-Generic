Jumping from a virtual relationship to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">living </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">together is a huge decision, and one that deserves serious time, thought and open communication. The fact that you don’t feel comfortable addressing this topic with your boyfriend over text shows that you’re not ready for the type of communication that is required in order to live with another person. Though you say you have video chatted before, there are a lot of potential dangers associated with online relationships. Please, please be cautious when you do meet up in person. For example, make sure to share your location with your friends and family and to meet in a public setting, like a coffee shop — at least for the first few times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, think about your own priorities. Does moving across five states to be with him suit your plans for the future? Is it worth leaving behind your friends and family for a person who a) you’ve never actually met and b) said he didn’t want a serious relationship with you? Also, being in a happy relationship with someone doesn’t necessarily mean you’d be compatible as roommates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the thing: You say you like him enough to move in with him — but do you love him? And if you’ve never met IRL, how can you tell the difference?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If he isn’t committed enough to meet you in person, it’s way too soon for you to commit to moving for him.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">♥</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why should we trust an undergrad to deliver anything resembling sound life advice?<br>\n<em>-Anonymous</em></b></p>\n<p>Dear Anonymous,</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Times They Are a-Changin’.

Should I stick it out for another week, or would that be lying?<br>\n</b><em><b>-Stuck In Love</b></em></p>\n<p>Dear Stuck In Love,</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already know that you don’t want to be with your partner any longer, it’s best if you just get it frickin’ over with already and break things off. First off, do you really want to torture yourself by having to sit through elaborate Valentine’s Day plans with someone that you’re not in love with anymore?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, breakups are painful enough already. Can you imagine how much more your partner is going to hate you once they realize that you are breaking up with them days after they have spent their last pennies on you? From their point of view, at least if you cut things off now, they can use those Disney tickets on someone who won’t curb stomp their heart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put yourself in their shoes and consider their needs and desires in these final moments of your relationship — especially since your timing fucking sucks. Communicating in a caring manner about why you are ending things on such short notice would also be helpful in reducing your partner’s confusion as this might be very hard for them. Though I understand that initiating breakups can be hard, make like a pair of Nikes and just do it! It would also be best if you did it as soon as possible because I know return policies on some items are only 14 days.</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

Despite the money, timing and fear of being lonely, having not known any other applicants, I figured it would all be worth it for the experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Bioma Travel was founded by UCSB Bren School alumni who personally guide and work with the students on each expedition. This direct relationship and commitment set the program apart from all other research/internship opportunities I had seen before.

For example, the AP Environmental Science Yosemite trip was what initially inspired me to pursue environmental science. However, the structure made me feel juvenile and restricted. Making first-hand observations and drawing conclusions that were physically and visually relatable convinced me to major in the subject; but on the other hand, taking instructions from our “leader” while sitting criss-cross applesauce took away from enjoying the landscape like real people, not children. The fake and forced classroom setting created an uncomfortable teacher-student dynamic, though the staff was in retrospect not much older than we were at the time. The rules were equally as patronizing —</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buddy-system, curfew, alphabetical arrangements, assigned groups, etc. I was apprehensive about this program being similarly condescending, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of freedom we were given.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of what we have at our fingertips here at UCSB — a whole network of cool people and unique opportunities that might just slip by if you don’t listen to the universe when it calls.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no idea what to expect as far as the kind of fieldwork we were supposed to conduct. The first couple of days were full of PowerPoints and lectures, but by the third night we set out on our first patrol. Using the word “patrol” for data collection was initially very confusing, and often confuses people when I explain the type of work we did, but we were in fact pacing the beaches on high alert. Staff members of the MINAE, a branch of the Costa Rican Ministry of Research, led two groups of us toward the north and south ends of the beach. We spent four to five hours a night searching for turtles and recording handwritten data on those that laid eggs, even in the pouring rain.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84986\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84986\" data-attachment-id=\"84986\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-19/turtles-and-travels-researching-abroad-in-costa-rica/bioma-2018-157/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=650%2C434&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,434\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BIOMA-2018-157\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84986 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BIOMA-2018-157-e1542657807133.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84986\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaun Wolfe / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere and energy were like no other; 12 eager yet exhausted girls decked out in the dorkiest water-resistant, dark-colored long-wear — complete with headlamps, ponchos and water shoes — marching single-file through murky estuaries and across the black sand that so perfectly matched the utterly black landscape. With only the moon that temporarily peaked out behind the mountains, the occasional red headlamp and the blinding flashlights of employed guards stationed to catch poachers, we walked for miles tallying the increasing amount of Olive Ridleys that arrived each night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to all other expeditions, our group had no trouble finding enough turtles to keep us busy.

Data included various measurements and observations; however, perhaps the most important category was egg count. We’d spend as long as 30 minutes counting as many as 130 eggs for just one turtle.

That being said, as young, healthy college students, we are in a unique position of both privilege and vulnerability.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On privilege, I’ll be the first to say it: Check your privilege. No, this isn’t just directed towards the senior srat members sulking over the loss of spring break 2020. It’s about all of us. It’s about the fact that we are all being impacted by this new reality in different ways. For some of us, the largest inconvenience we will face is taking our classes online and not getting to see our friends in person, but many members of our community are facing challenges beyond that of a student. Many will lose their lives and many more will lose their loved ones, their livelihoods, their jobs and their health. We have all lost a part of our freedom, but our privileges are unique to each of us, and it is for that reason that community is so vital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The virus is here. There is one identified case in Isla Vista so far and we cannot afford to be selfish and think only of ourselves. Don’t wait for this to become “real’’ or relevant to you. Don’t wait until you know someone who has it or know someone who has lost a family member. The virus is affecting our community now and our community’s health depends on how effectively all of us practice social distancing. We have the capacity to stay home without completely halting our lives. We have the privilege of taking our courses online and we have the power to support each other. Think of your neighbors, think of the people you love, the people you don’t, the human lives at risk and when you think of your own very real struggles, think of them among the struggles of those which make up our community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while having this awareness, it is also important to evaluate how these sudden changes have affected you. The world is moving forward and we are moving forward with it, but many of us haven’t stopped to feel that move for everything that it is and will be. As college students, we have an almost inevitable dependence on our campus, not just as our place for academic development but our place for meaningful interpersonal interaction. Our lives as college students provide us with routine and stability; our campus fosters curiosity and evokes creativity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are vulnerable to the sudden loss of all of the smallest details that made up our days: the light, ocean mist in the morning, the bustle of the bike lane, the familiar energy of the Arbor. And in many ways, we are vulnerable to silence at a time when we need to think and process and feel. So, to come full circle, do your rambling. You may not have clear feelings about the loss of riding around the bike circles or late nights in the library, but you know you have some feelings about it. Rambling your way through those thoughts with your friends will be a good reminder that you’re not alone. We are here and we are struggling together.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*socially distanced* xoxo,</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AJ</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to alleviate stress during times of uncertainty is to stay informed!

I was planning on going home to see my parents but at this rate, I don’t think I can risk going home and getting my parents sick. What should I do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any issue you have with housemates, it’s important to address it as soon as possible, as calmly as possible and as reasonably as possible. With this issue in particular, there is a lot at stake. I would suggest having a conversation with all of your housemates to establish some rules and practices during the coronavirus. None of us have lived through a pandemic before so it’s not expected that everyone will react to this situation in the same way. However, that isn’t an excuse to be careless or insensitive to one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line: Your home is a shared space. Given how easily the virus spreads, your house is only as safe as the most careless person in it. Even if four out of five of your housemates are cautious, one housemate being inconsiderate about hygiene or who they interact with will put you all at risk. This isn’t to say that your house needs to be on lockdown, but there are ways all of you can actively work to protect each other while making sure people feel comfortable in their own spaces. For instance, you could all make sure you wash your hands as soon as you come home or develop a cleaning schedule. You may also want to discuss what will happen if one of you gets sick. Will there be a designated bathroom for that person? How will you ensure you are all properly informed on best practices to keep each other healthy? Where will this person go if they need medical assistance? That is up for your house to decide, but having these conversations early will help reduce potentially stressful and risky situations. Having awareness is extremely important — be aware of your own needs and be prepared to advocate for yourself, but also be aware of how your actions may impact others around you.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The coronavirus is basically the flu, why is everyone freaking out so much? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not the fucking flu. Although there are some symptoms that resemble those of the flu, COVID-19 should not be handled as if it is the average flu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years ago, Bill Gates gave us a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AEMKudv5p0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As he put it, “an epidemic that would be more infectious and spread faster than Ebola did… is the greatest risk of a huge tragedy.” This would be the kind of tragedy Gates said we were unprepared for. He identified two main types of flus: ones that spread effectively between humans and ones that are extremely deadly. Those two factors have only occurred together once in history, during the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, known as the Spanish flu, which took the lives of nearly 65 million people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mortality rates of both the Spanish flu and COVID-19 are roughly 2.5% for the time being, but the coronavirus’s potential to spread is what makes it even more deadly. Many people who are already infected display no symptoms for days. These are the people who are unknowingly spreading the disease and causing avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hospitals’ capacities are limited by the number of available beds. Roughly 20% of coronavirus cases require hospital treatment and the virus’s ability to spread exponentially can lead to a surge in cases. This surge is what results in avoidable deaths due to our healthcare system being overwhelmed. That’s the key. If we are able to limit the total number of cases, there will be less of a need for hospital beds and less avoidable deaths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yes, the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people, but its ability to spread is nothing like that of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why is it racist to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus? It did start in China just like a lot of other really deadly diseases, and the Chinese government even tried to cover it up initially.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s racist because to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus would be attaching certain — most likely negative — ideas about the virus to an entire group of people. The actions and decisions of the Chinese government are not the actions of Chinese people as a whole. The actions by some Chinese people in one city or one region are not the actions of individuals of Chinese descent that live in America. Even if there was evidence that 100% linked the Coronavirus to a wet market in Wuhan, to attach the disease to an ethnic group is most definitely prejudicial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not the first time infectious disease has led to prejudice and it is certainly not the last. This pattern has only done damage to the sanctity of cultural diversity and the unity of this country. Ignorance should not be the choice we make as it will only spread hate and fear, if not reinforce the hold of xenophobia within the US.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">~ History lesson for you ~</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1959-1961, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">largest famine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in history took place in China, killing an estimated more than 30 million people. In the following decades, much of China’s population remained in poverty and consequently was starving. The communist regime which controlled all food production was unable to provide enough for its people to survive. It was at this point in 1978 that the government allowed for private farming. This practice of private farming lifted millions of suffering people out of poverty. A </span><a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16603900.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">household-based contract responsibility system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was put in place in which land was leased to families with the conditions of meeting fixed output quotas. Families were given land to meet their own needs and it was on these smaller private farms that families caught wild animals such as turtles to feed themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this wildlife farming was successful, it gained governmental support, which drastically changed the course of wildlife farming. These farms – whatever needed to be done to mitigate poverty – were encouraged. With the support of the government and the further development of policies to protect this type of farming, smaller farms turned into an industry and along with this industry came the illegal trading of endangered animals like tigers and pangolins. Some of these endangered species were later </span><a href=\"https://eia-international.org/wildlife/saving-tigers/tiger-farming/chinas-wildlife-protection-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sanctioned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the government for sale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What started as a solution to the imminent hunger plaguing families across China turned into an industry for the wealthy few of the country. China is the </span><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/wild-laws-china-and-its-role-illicit-wildlife-trade\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">top consumer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of illegally traded species but these species are being consumed by the richest people in China — a minority of the population that holds extreme lobbying capabilities (what’s new). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you go stereotyping an entire group of people, think about what you might be missing.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>HELP!!!! CABIN FEVER!!!!!!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was my original inclination to tell you to try something new to fill your time, and I do encourage that, but you can only try so many new things before “trying something new” loses its excitement and sparkle. In that vein, I would say a few things: stay active, have regular virtual social contact and do more of what you love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to underestimate how much we actually move around when we go from class to class or to various meetings. Now that seemingly everything has been moved to the virtual world, it’s important not just to get up and move around, but to actually go outside. We live way too close to the beach and the mountains for anyone to stay inside anyways. Even if you’re not a particularly active person, taking a walk to the beach or even just around the block can be therapeutic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot stress enough how important social isolation is, but even though you shouldn’t physically be with anyone outside of the people you absolutely must see, you should still actively try to talk with your friends. Check up on them and also use this as a time to talk about how all of these changes have affected you. It is too easy to close yourself off to the world but short, regular check-ins with your loved ones will help you maintain your sanity while socially isolating. Plan wine nights or game nights with groups of friends once a week over FaceTime or Google Hangouts or Snapchat (try the filters — you won’t regret it). Having regular, scheduled meetings with your friends will give you something to look forward to. I also have gotten in the habit of sending my friends photos of puppies and Jude Law. Likewise, I always love it when I get articles from my dad or funny memes from my friends; these small points of contact throughout the day make all the difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, do more of what you love. Invest in doing the things you love and connect with people who share your interests. If you enjoy exercising, join a virtual yoga group or plan weekly runs around the lagoon with your housemates. If you enjoy reading, start a book club or make a reading schedule with all of the books you’d like to read. Plan virtual movie night or painting nights with friends. Set personal goals for yourself, something you can track. Whatever you enjoy, make plans and connect with others!</span></p>\n<p><em>Got an anonymous question for AJ?

Whoever thought curiosity killed the cat was wrong. Curiosity just killed the cat that didn’t take the proper precautions. There are so many different ways to experience pleasure, and anal is one of them for more people than you’d think. While it may seem a little intimidating at first, with a little preparation, some practice, open communication and industrial amounts of lube, you should be sliding your way to a new experience in no time.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a common misconception that </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/hey-hillary-clinton-i-pegged/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anal sex can only be pleasurable for those who have a prostate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; however, regardless of gender, the anal cavity is filled with nerve endings. What people are most familiar with in terms of anal stimulation is the prostate gland, which is located at the bottom of the bladder, just in front of the rectum. And I only know that because I watched this</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Ayq248u_8\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the opening to the anus is where most of the nerve endings are, stimulating the prostate is what is often most pleasurable and can even result in prostate-induced orgasms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those without a prostate, anal sex can still be enjoyable. Similar to vaginal sex, the clitoris is stimulated during anal sex. While a large portion of the clitoris is external, there is a portion that extends inside that is stimulated during anal sex and can cause clitoral orgasms. Some have even claimed having stronger orgasms during anal penetration than vaginal penetration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I will admit anal sex isn’t for everyone, I do think it is something you should try if you are curious. That being said, if you are going to try, it is extremely important to be prepared. Part of that preparation is finding a partner you are not only comfortable with, but someone you feel you can have an open line of communication with. Trying anal will be painful at first for whomever is being penetrated, so it’s important for each partner to be aware of how the other is feeling. Open communication will help both partners figure out what is most pleasurable for each of you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to finding your partner, there are a few other steps to take into consideration. A primary concern for people trying anal sex for the first time is cleanliness. While a little poop here and there should be expected, it is not something to worry about. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a17749/anal-sex-misconceptions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most fecal matter sits above the anus and rectum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some people choose to use anal douching, but many are fine with just taking a little extra time to wash in and around the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also extremely important to stay relaxed and go slow during the act. Part of the reason anal sex hurts is due to tensing up. Let your body calm down and start with something small. Some people start with fingers or toys and then move to bigger things, such as butt plugs. Going slow will not only help prevent tearing but will also help build arousal. Before any penetration, however, make sure you are using lots of lube!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you take anything away from this article it should be that preparation will enhance your anal experience. There are a lot of resources online, but it’s important to remember that everyone’s bodies are different. To help you get started here are some tips on anal </span><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips/a6574/buttplay-for-the-wary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foreplay</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. ;)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">☆                                                                                  ☆                                                                            ☆</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>My boss keeps hitting on me :( How do I get him to stop? I’m already dating someone else.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, I am so sorry you are going through this. Regardless of whether or not you are dating someone, this behavior is inappropriate and unfair, and you should not feel as if you need to justify your feelings about the situation. At the end of the day, his actions are making you uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say at this point it is most important for you to identify exactly what behaviors are making you uncomfortable. It could just be him hitting on you, but oftentimes that behavior is accompanied by other actions that could contribute to the discomfort as well, e.g. being passive-aggressive when you shut down his attempts or unwanted forms of physical affection. There is a laundry list of possibilities, and identifying these behaviors will make it easier for you to articulate the situation and how it has created an unsustainable work environment for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I usually err on the side of confrontation, I think in situations like these direct confrontation is not always the best option for everyone. I would, however, advise you to tell someone who has the power to change the situation, even if it isn’t your boss directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every workplace there should  be someone who is responsible for handling these situations. Normally, this person works in the human resources (HR) department; however, if you are unsure who specifically handles these situations, the HR department is a good place to start. Whomever you end up speaking with should be able to explain all of your options and help you decide what is best for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think confronting your boss is the best option, make sure you are clear about which behaviors make you uncomfortable. This should not come off as a threat, but your boss should know that if his behavior doesn’t stop you will have to speak with someone else. This is never an easy thing to do, but remember that being comfortable in your workplace is not a privilege but a right.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d3413dcc208f1ace614a73bb57bc079?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/aj/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">AJ</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>AJ is the advice guru of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em>If you know who she is, keep it to yourself.
