At UC Santa Barbara, for example, that includes an additional $103.50 RecCen2 Expansion fee, a $60.06 UCen Expansion fee and a $39.39 Transit System fee, </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among others.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was at home. I wasn’t using the library and I wasn’t using the gym and I wasn’t using the pool. But I was paying for it,” Brandmeyer, a third-year psychology major, said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she is frustrated by the UC’s dismissal of student pleas and petitions — one of which </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made rounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB in March — and for standing its ground on refusing to withhold student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most student fees are relatively small compared to the price of tuition, students who choose to foot the bill with loans will be forced to shell out “thousands and thousands of dollars” down the line as their loans compound, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very unsettled and I think it’s very hypocritical and revealing of what [the UC’s] true motive is,” she said. “At the end of the day, [they] just want to make money off us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC declined to comment on the litigation but </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/university-of-california-announces-no-intention-to-adjust-tuition-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/other-fee-information/payment-refunds.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar </span><a href=\"https://sundial.csun.edu/157547/news/csu-system-sued-for-refusing-to-refund-campus-related-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by a Sonoma State University student against the California State University system on Monday, a spokesperson for the CSU system said it will “vigorously defend against the lawsuit,” EdSource </span><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/students-sue-california-universities-over-fees-lost-amid-pandemic/630377\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said the UC’s ambivalent response in supporting students prompted her to take legal action and “to be the voice” for those who are financially impacted by having their student fees withheld. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re accepted into the University of California, they were like, ‘We’re on your side. We want you to succeed. We want you to do research. We’re here to guide you through your four years,’” Brandemeyer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But the minute you show up,” she added, “it’s kind of like, ‘Okay, well you’re on your own now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking note of the student response to the UC, Garcia said her law firm looked to </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-napolitano-refund-uc-campus-fees-for-spring-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student-generated petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fee reimbursements as a framework for what eventually developed into </span><a href=\"https://dicellolevitt.com/california-university-systems-sued-on-behalf-of-more-than-700000-students-for-refusing-to-refund-fees-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> class-action lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope to achieve the goals that the students have wanted all along,” she said. “If you’ve seen those change.org petitions that were started, there are thousands of students across the country who have signed onto those.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to ensure that the schools will stop charging fees for services that are no longer available and return the funds that they’re holding onto for services that haven’t been provided,” Garcia added. “That money belongs to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the court to make a decision, Garcia maintained that the “goal is ultimately to get the students their money back… no matter how long that takes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she has faith that she will win the lawsuit, noting the outpour of students who are working nearly full-time while balancing a packed schedule amidst the pandemic. With feelings of uncertainty, frustration and desperation in mind, “I think that a lot of people are going to be standing their ground with this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the point where a lot of people are saying enough is enough. [The UC] is saying ‘Oh, we’re saving this money for a rainy day,’” Brandmeyer said. “This is a rainy day.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As crowds grew to 25,000 in 1991 and then made a massive leap to 40,000 attendees in 1992, according to the Office of Student Life, the number of accidents, crimes, violations and arrests increased as well. After this drastic surge in attendance, local law enforcement drafted a “Five Year Plan” to help limit the number of party-goers who would flood I.V. the following year in 1993. Similar to the restrictions we see today, the plan came equipped with noise ordinances, confiscation of possibly dangerous props or costumes, barricades and restricted parking, with aims to improve the safety of the community and keep things under control.</p>\n<p>According to Geoff Green, a UCSB alumnus who served as Associated Students president during the 1993-94 academic year, his year in office marked a huge transition towards a significant increase in police and authoritative presence during Halloween. Green said that although the plan has good intentions and the safety measures were needed, students seemed unsure on how Halloween would play out.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, people were onboard with the principle, but concerned with implementation,” Green said, “especially since this was only a couple years after Rodney King and the L.A. Riots — people were suspicious of law enforcement and authority.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, following the increase of police in I.V. caused an increase in the level of resident complaints against police.</p>\n<p>“1993 marked a significant jump in the level of police enforcement in I.V. during Halloween, taking authoritative levels to an all-time high,” Green said. “With this massive influx of authoritative enforcement, Isla Vista felt like a police-occupied state for many I.V. residents and afterwards, there were dozens of complaints of poor treatment by authority and many cases of civil rights abuses by authority.”</p>\n<p>Green said students organized to counter the increased presence of law enforcement with an overwhelming amount of monitoring done by citizens. Green put cameras into the hands of student volunteers to monitor Halloween in general, but also to monitor the police force. This civilian tactic worked to balance the huge numbers of law enforcement officials and keep them on their best behavior, Green said.</p>\n<p>“Recording kept law enforcement on its best behavior and it went very well, it was very peaceful and it greatly reduced the number of complaints against police behavior and unjust arrests,” Green said. “It worked as a friendly reminder to authority that we’re watching out for our community — it wasn’t an anti-cop thing, it was a way to respond to the overwhelming authority presence through being our own watching presence in the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Deputy Mark Ward, who has worked as an I.V. Foot Patrol officer for the past 15 years, the increasing numbers of enforcement officials is necessary to protect I.V. during Halloween each year.</p>\n<p>“Halloween seems to get bigger and bigger every year,” Ward said. “Consequently, with increasing numbers of visitors, the law enforcement presence also has to increase. There has to be more law enforcement available to protect the growing number of people.”</p>\n<p>Ward said he noticed that in the last few years there has been a change in attitude towards law enforcement officers, and it has been “generally more assaultive.”</p>\n<p>“Years ago, back when I started as an officer, if you saw a law enforcement officer fighting somebody you would stop what you’re doing and help the officer,” Ward said. “On the other hand, nowadays, in that same situation, everyone or witness now take out their devices to video what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>However, Green said that video recording is a part of officer-to-citizen accountability.</p>\n<p>“The advantage generally goes to law enforcement when there are stationary cameras set up and police are largely given the benefit of the doubt in cases,” Green said.</p>\n<p>According to Ward, there has been a “fundamental change” in behavioral issues in I.V. — particularly in how college-age students react to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“When I started as an officer in I.V. you could walk up to a person or group and ask ‘What’s going on?’ and they would answer and be respectful,” Ward said. “Now with a simple ‘How are you doing?’ instead of receiving an answer, the group or person in question starts videotaping and chooses to escalate the encounter into a fight and it’s a waste of time, it’s dangerous and it puts everyone at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to Green, the level of police presence in Isla Vista will “probably continue” as the norm until I.V. has more say in its own governance.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

One revision is the inclusion of “dating partners” under the definition of “intimate partners,” allowing victims to seek protection from domestic violence and stalking.</p>\n<p>The Pause for Gun Safety Act would allow friends or family members to seek a temporary “gun violence prevention order” if they fear that someone close to them is posing a threat to themselves or others. The gun violence prevention order would effectively prohibit, for a brief period, a given individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm and grant authorities permission to confiscate firearms already in possession.</p>\n<p>According to Capps, voting certain candidates into office, such as herself, will allow for changes in legislation to happen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve supported legislation ever since I got there; the relationship between gun violence and domestic violence, safety issues and now in this case, allowing a parent or someone else in a position of recognizing someone might be a danger to themselves or others, to intervene in time for the guns to be confiscated,” Capps said.</p>\n<p>Since the events of May 23, Martinez said he has toured the country, visiting 11 states as well as Washington D.C. in a campaign to change state legislation regarding gun safety.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, solving gun violence issues requires more than one answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one solution to gun violence; it’s a multifaceted problem,” Martinez said, “There isn’t one solution to this kind of thing. You make changes that incrementally solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said voting is a response that is one potential solution to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Voting matters,” Martinez said. “It’s a black-and-white choice.”</p>\n<p>According to Capps, gun control is not the only pressing issue in this “critical” election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been a champion for making college more affordable,” Capps said. “We want to make sure that we protect the environment, that we put people to work in projects that will bring our economy forward, take advantage of alternative energy other than fossil fuels.

There’s all kinds of issues at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Capps went door-to-door in I.V. to ask community members to vote the next day. This morning, she was up at 5:00 a.m. to hang pamphlets on the doorknobs of the residences in I.V. to remind voters to turn in ballots.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of excitement in this election, so they forget about the ballot, it’s still sitting on top of the refrigerator, and then they say ‘Oh my gosh, I have this ballot here!’ Well they can take it to any polling place,” Capps said, “And there’s several of them around Isla Vista and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel, Saint Michael’s University Church, Saint Mark’s University Parish and Merton Housing Co-Op are all polling places located in I.V., while on-campus voters can go to the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, the Loma Pelona Center and the Linda Vista Room in Santa Catalina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/","id":3632,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3631,3630,3629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University of California Announces No Intention To Adjust Tuition Fees","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tuition is set at a UC-wide level, and individual campuses do not have the authority to change it.
