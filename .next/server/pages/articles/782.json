Three players finished in double figures, including Johnson, who led the Gauchos offensively with 16 points, shooting 5-10 and 2-4 from downtown.</p>\n<p>Tilleman continued to break out offensively, capturing her second straight double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. She shot 7-10 from the field.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, I just got sick of people saying that I wasn’t a scorer,” Tilleman said. “Something has clicked and I hope to carry it on.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ other starting post, junior forward Sweets Underwood, also shot 50 percent from the field and tallied a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds. And while senior forward Kelsey Adrian continued her cold shooting, she contributed five assists, tying her career high.</p>\n<p>“With Tilleman and Sweets, the percentage that they’re shooting is amazing,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “After they knock down a couple, they’re very unselfish, so they’re going to find the shooters.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was also up to par, holding a CSUB team (4-21 overall) that averages nearly 70 points per game to just 49.</p>\n<p>“We were talking to each other at the point where they had 42 points and we said, ‘We’re keeping them under 50,’” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>To open up the game, UCSB, whose players were all adorned in pink to support breast cancer awareness, fell victim to their typical routine of lagging behind early.</p>\n<p>“[CSUB is] a different team than we’ve seen,” Tilleman said. “They’re very small, and they took advantage of that right away on offense by driving and they’d either get to the rim or they’d kick it out for a three-pointer.”</p>\n<p>While UC Santa Barbara outshot the Roadrunners 44.4 percent to 38.7 percent in the first period, the Gauchos were outrebounded 20-15. They made up for the differential in the second half, though, and ended the game outrebounding the Roadrunners 45-39.</p>\n<p>“That’s part of our identity that we’re going to get it done on defense and on the boards,” Johnson said. “We didn’t do that in the first half, so we got a little chip on our shoulder and got it done in the second half.”</p>\n<p>After halftime, UCSB dug itself into a bigger hole. CSUB took advantage of sloppy play by the Gauchos and mounted their largest lead of the game at 42-33.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, they are a great second-half team and sparked their run before it was too late. UCSB will look to carry their momentum into two Big West games this week against UC Irvine and UC Riverside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/gauchos-rally-win-csu-bakersfield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/gauchos-rally-win-csu-bakersfield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/gauchos-rally-win-csu-bakersfield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/gauchos-rally-win-csu-bakersfield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-13/gauchos-rally-win-csu-bakersfield/","id":782,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[781,780,779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Remain Undefeated in League","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated UC Davis 5-2 in the last home game of the regular season Friday.

I thought I served well and that helped me a lot,” Hamilton said. “My best shot was my forehand, so I worked hard to get my body to the right spot in order to hit that shot as much as I could.”</p>\n<p>The only negatives from the day were two matches that saw the Gauchos losing in third set tie-breakers.</p>\n<p>As the match was already over with UCSB winning four singles matches and the doubles point, both senior Sasha Gryaznov and Seemann’s matches ended in ten point tie-breaks instead of complete third sets. Gryaznov lost 6-2, 2-6, (10-8) against senior Kyle Miller and Seemann went down against freshman Bryce McKelvie 7-5, 1-6 (13-11).</p>\n<p>“I think this week we will be working on fitness a lot to get ready for Cal Poly and the Big West,” Hamilton said. “We really want to beat Cal Poly to get that No. 1 seed and ultimately get the bye [in the first round] so we don’t have to play as many matches.”</p>\n<p>The match was also the last ever regualr season home match for Gryaznov, who was celebrated prior to singles play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a week of practice before heading to Cal Poly Saturday for their last regular season match. With a win, UCSB can take the No. 1 seed going into the Big West Tournament and thus enjoy a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The match is an extremely important step for the Gauchos on their way to hopefully making it to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/","id":779,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[778,777,776],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Returns Home to Face Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Home sweet home.

With a week off to practice and recover, UCSB looks forward to the opportunity to avenge a loss at Riverside (11-12, 5-5) earlier this year. In that game on Jan. 12, the Gauchos lost to the Highlanders 79-70 in overtime.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big game,” senior forward/guard Christian Peterson said. “From here on out we have to win out because we want that second seed in the Big West tournament. Each game becomes more and more important, especially coming off a loss.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s lone loss on the road trip was against Cal State Fullerton (15-7, 7-3) on Saturday. Fullerton was on fire offensively in the team’s win over the Gauchos, shooting 52.5 percent from the floor and a blistering 65.4 percent on three-pointers.</p>\n<p>“We played a team that got really hot,” coach Williams said. “I told (the players) to keep their head up and don’t let this game cause a hangover. We played well on the road trip and had been getting better.”</p>\n<p>In that loss, two prolific Gauchos reached career milestones. With 28 points in the game, senior guard Orlando Johnson moved into third place all-time in the UCSB record books, becoming the fourth Gaucho ever to reach 1,600 career points. With at least eight games remaining, Johnson has a firm chance at becoming UCSB’s all-time leading scorer. In the same game, senior guard James Nunnally poured in 19 points, increasing his career scoring total to 1,491 — good for sixth place all-time.</p>\n<p>The loss to Fullerton dropped the Gauchos into a tie with the Titans for second place in the Big West, behind only first-place Long Beach State (17-6, 10-0). Santa Barbara lost to Long Beach at home earlier this season, but will get a chance for revenge when the team travels to face the 49ers on Feb. 22.</p>\n<p>UCSB has already played in three televised games, going 0-3 in those contests. The Gauchos have three more games planned for national TV — an ESPNU BracketBuster matchup at Utah State on Feb. 18, the Long Beach State game on ESPN2, and a Feb. 25 home game against Cal Poly on ESPNU.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if it pumps us up or not — we are kind of oblivious to it to be honest,” Coach Williams said of playing on the national stage. “We need to play our best basketball, and we are disappointed that we have not played particularly well on national television.”</p>\n<p>“It brings more people out to the games which is fun,” freshman center Alan Williams said of playing on the national stage. “With more fans in the seats, we feed off that energy and noise.”</p>\n<p>After the Riverside game this Saturday, the Gauchos will once again hit the road for a three-game road trip. After the road trip, the team will finish off its Big West season with three straight games at home.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday is at 7:30 p.m. The game is televised on Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/ucsb-returns-home-face-riverside/","id":780,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[779,778,777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast 49ers in Conference Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"The Big West season is officially underway, and the UCSB women's basketball team has its first win.

The Gauchos have now won their last three games and with Thursday night’s win over the 49ers Santa Barbara is 1-0 in conference play, improving their overall record to 4-9. While UCSB is rolling compared to the start of the season, the 49ers are pushed to a dismal 2-13 overall as they open league play with their sixth straight loss.</p>\n<p>A rematch of last year’s Big West Championship, in which Long Beach got the best of the Gauchos, Thursday night’s game opened with an energy in the Thunderdome signaling the return of conference-play atmosphere. The 49ers pressured Santa Barbara using a 3-2 zone along with a full-court press disrupting the Gauchos’ offense early. Shots weren’t falling easily for either team and the Gauchos had a difficult time keeping possession, turning the ball over 7 times in the first quarter alone.</p>\n<p>For nearly the first seven minutes of play, UCSB had only 3 points off a Drew Edelman free throw and a jumper by Danae Miller. The defensive battle had the score locked at 5-3 Long Beach before Makala Roper knocked down a three for the Gauchos with 3:38 remaining. A few back and forth buckets closed out the quarter 12-12.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson said following the game, “Sometimes you’ve got to be able to handle that this might one of those nights, it might be in the forties and fifties and you’ve got to be comfortable doing that,” said Henrickson, “You’ve got to be able to play through that and still win in the fifties.”</p>\n<p>Makala Roper got things going for Santa Barbara in the second quarter, draining her second three ball of the night to put the Gauchos ahead 15-12. Long Beach responded by going on an 8-0 run, forcing head coach Bonnie Henrickson to call a quick timeout with roughly 6:04 remaining. Out of the 30-second timeout, the Gauchos went inside to find Edelman in back to back possessions for two easy buckets. Edelman asserted herself in the paint throughout the game, getting good position as well as good looks at the basket, but had a hard time getting shots to fall. The redshirt senior did have a career night rebounding the ball, grabbing 23 boards while just missing a double-double with 9 points. Roper kept heating up, making another shot from beyond the arc to put the Gauchos down a single point heading into halftime 22-23.</p>\n<p>The first half of play featured both squads struggling to find the net, as UCSB and Long Beach each shot close to 31 percent overall and 27 percent from three-point territory. Edelman had 13 of her final 23 rebounds at half, but UCSB also committed 13 turnovers in the half.</p>\n<p>In spite of their rough start shooting, the Gauchos came out after halftime with a re-focused energy on both ends of the court. Santa Barbara opened the third on a 9-0 run, holding the 49ers scoreless for almost 5 minutes. UCSB went on to score 17 total points in the quarter, with Sarah Bates, Sarah Porter and again Roper chipping in a three-pointer each. Roper’s three came at the buzzer to lift the Gauchos to a 39-28 advantage after three quarters of play. The 49ers had a rough quarter to say the least, going 1-10 from the field, 0-4 from three, and 3-10 from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Makala Roper made another three to kick off the fourth quarter for her game and season-high 15 points, all from beyond the arc. Long Beach guard Shanijah Davison got to the line on the following possession, converting 1 of 2 free throws. The freshman Davison had a difficult night, shooting only 1-10 from the field and finishing the game with 4 points. Heading into the game, Davison was the 49ers’ leading scorer with 11.9 points per game. 49er Cecily Wilson knocked down 1 of 2 shots from the line shortly after Davison, but the Gauchos answered with an Akilah Jennings three to take their largest lead of the night, up 15, with 8:50 remaining.</p>\n<p>Down 45-30 with just 8:50 left, 49ers refused to back off as Long Beach upped their defensive pressure to disrupt the Gauchos. After Akilah jennings made a nice move to the basket for a bucket at the 6:51 mark, the Gauchos failed to make another shot aside from free throws. Long Beach used their defensive stops to generate offense, going on a 10-0 run over the next 6 minutes to cut Santa Barbara’s lead to 3. Cecily Wilson had 7 of her team-high 9 points in the fourth to go with her team-high 10 rebounds. Down 47-44 with 53 seconds left, Long Beach mistakenly fouled Sarah Bates, sending her to the line where she knocked down the two free throws. Sloppy play and a variety of weird calls by the referees found the 49ers forced to send Bates to the line again with only 3 seconds to go. Bates came up clutch at the line again, hitting both shots to give the Gauchos the 51-44 victory.</p>\n<p>After the game, the freshman guard Bates discussed her team’s improved play in the third quarter. “I think we got a little more used to the pressure, but we were still struggling with it. It was our offense more than their defense, even though they’re a good defensive team,” said Bates.</p>\n<p>Following the Gauchos’ 1-9 start in the regular season, the Gauchos finally have momentum and a growing identity when they play. “I mean it’s a lot better than being 1-9,” said Drew Edelman, “We have a little bit more confidence going in. Especially now that it’s conference play, we said, ‘Ok whatever our record was preseason ultimately it doesn’t matter, it’s all about conference.’”</p>\n<p>With a big game against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Santa Barbara is hoping to carry its energy further into conference play. “It was a process, we’ve learned from it. So now, new season, we’re 1 and 0,” continued Edelman.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson is looking to continue her team’s growth this season, as beating the now 2-13 49ers is not as daunting as a task as beating Cal Poly. “So, we’re fortunate to find a way to win, but that locker room is mature enough to know we weren’t very good and we’ve got to be better on Saturday, and we’ll get a chance to be better on  Saturday,” said Henrickson, “And we’re mature enough to recognize that.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry game Saturday afternoon, with tip-off scheduled for 2:00pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/","id":781,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[780,779,778],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
