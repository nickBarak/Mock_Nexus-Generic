According to Hertz, a friend’s invitation and the promise of “free stuff” brought him to the carnival.</p>\n<p>“It’s a fun environment,” Hertz said. “People are out here interacting where otherwise they’d be in their rooms, studying.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56821\" style=\"width: 369px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"358697386\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56823\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56821\" data-attachment-id=\"56821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/pardall-carnival-brings-food-fun-games-and-community-gathering/christine-skari-pardall-carnival-banner/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=1600%2C1010&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5200\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412905207\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christine Skari Pardall Carnival Banner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?fit=888%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner-1024x646.jpg?resize=359%2C226\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"359\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=1024%2C646&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?resize=250%2C158&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christine-Skari-Pardall-Carnival-Banner.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year microbiology and Japanese major Jonathan Tai helped tabled the Alpha Phi Omega booth during the carnival, and said that the carnival was a very positive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>“From my viewpoint the energy at the carnival was great.

President Ali Guthy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young. The event culminated in a surprise appearance and performance by UCSB alumni and rock musicians Jack Johnson and Animal Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n<p>As the first person to speak at the event, Guthy said “Come Together” was organized in order to honor the memories of six members of “our UCSB family,” — George Chen, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss — by remembering them while moving forward with efforts to improve the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“As a new academic year has begun and we being to focus on the hopes, goals and dreams that lie ahead, we remember them,” Guthy said. “As we take those moments out of our busy day to cherish what it means to be a Gaucho and part of an extraordinary, caring family, we remember them.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, who said he still has “difficulty wrapping [his] head around making sense out of the senseless acts of violence,” of May 23, “Come Together” was formed in order to encourage students to define and determine the character and quality of the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“You students individually and collectively have the ability to make Isla Vista and UCSB the kind of community that is not only extraordinarily beautiful and fun but also safe and healthy,” Young said. “I urge you to seize this moment and begin the important but hard difficult work of reclaiming and rebuilding our community. We got this.”</p>\n<p>After Young and Guthy spoke, Johnson and ALO musically collaborated, giving students a free performance for over an hour and a half. Throughout playing songs such as “Good People,” “Better Together” and “Banana Pancakes,” Johnson and ALO members commented on their time spent in Santa Barbara and reminisced on the fond memories they associate with their former life in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A photo essay related to this article can be found <a

California’s postdoctoral scholars voted overwhelmingly to ratify a one-year agreement with the University between Oct. 19 and 27, ending long and sometimes tense negotiations between the UC postdoc union (UAW 5810) and the UC.</p>\n<p>The agreement, which instates yearly raises, increases health care coverage and loosens restrictions on international postdocs, was ratified by 98.8 percent of postdocs in a count of 3,471 to 42. Negotiations came down to the last hour on Oct. 1, with postdocs threatening to strike. After having to extend the previous contract to Oct. 9, the two sides reached a new one-year contract which the union ultimately ratified Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>The union, which represents more than 6,000 postdocs at all UC campuses, charged the University with “bad faith bargaining” and “refusing to provide the Union with information” necessary for negotiations in a document submitted Sept. 18 to California’s Public Employment Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Although the union never actually went on strike, president of the postdoc union Anke Schennink said she believes the threat of a strike led to concessions from UC negotiators who were “definitely aware” of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The strike] was not mentioned at the bargaining table itself, but it came up in conversations in the hallway,” Schennink said. “We were willing to go on strike, and we were willing to prepare for that if the University hadn’t made any moves towards us.”</p>\n<p>Director of the UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Mark Lawson said the agreement is an “accomplishment” for both sides.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to look at the big picture and be happy that the UC and the postdoc representation are able to come to an agreement,” Lawson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The previous deal had run for three years, and Schennink said the new one-year contract means the union is already preparing for next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We have already started making plans and are already working on our strategy for next year,” Schennink said. “There is really no plan to relax.”</p>\n<p>The one-year time frame also allows the University and the union to get right to work on issues where there is common ground, according to Schennink.</p>\n<p>“We made some improvements and they are important, but there are also some other improvements that both sides wanted to see, definitely in terms of gender equity and childcare reimbursements,” Schennink said. “With a one-year contract, more post-docs will have more opportunity to participate and express their views and say what’s important.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said female postdocs face additional difficulties, referring to a UC Berkeley professor who was accused of kissing and groping female students against their will.</p>\n<p>“As a postdoc, you are in a lot of ways dependent on your professor,” Schennink said. “A professor in your postdoc can make or break your career.”</p>\n<p>In October, Schennink said members of the negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.” When asked if that is still the case, she said the new contract would not immediately change that feeling.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that changes in a month or in a couple of months,” Schennink said. “I think this takes years, given how lengthy the process was for bargaining … and how ridiculous and absurd the University’s comments were.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara unit chair for the union and postdoctoral fellow in UCSB’s materials department Patrick Callahan said he voted for the deal and expected it to pass.</p>\n<p>“I did expect [the vote] to be about as overwhelming as it was,” Callahan said. “We didn’t really lose anything so I’m not really surprised.”</p>\n<p>Callahan said while other postdocs would benefit from the contract, his job would not change much, if at all.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we were really fighting for was protections for international postdocs, but I’m not an international postdoc so that doesn’t really affect me,” Callahan said. “I don’t expect things to change for me, but for other people I’m sure it will make some difference.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

neglected a “dangerous” part of campus.</p>\n<p>Three men forcibly took the unnamed female student, who was 19 at the time, from Isla Vista late on Feb. 22, 2014 and raped and beat her for several hours until approximately 4 a.m. on Feb. 23. The lawsuit calls the attack “the worst case of sexual assault” at UCSB and claims the university is culpable because it did not adequately maintain an overgrown area between the UCSB track and tennis courts, where the attack occurred. The lawsuit states the area was “so overgrown with foliage that it resembled a maze, enticing the public to hide and get lost in it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67673\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67673\" data-attachment-id=\"67673\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/screen-shot-2016-01-27-at-2-32-10-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=1070%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1070,555\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 2.32.10 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=888%2C460&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67673\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM-1024x531.png?resize=888%2C460\" alt=\"The lawsuit states student was attacked between the track and tennis courts (via Google)\" width=\"888\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=768%2C398&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?w=1070&amp;ssl=1 1070w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67673\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The lawsuit states the student was attacked between UCSB’s track and tennis courts (via Google)</p></div>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in Santa Barbara Superior Court by attorneys Tyrone Maho and Joshua Lynn, states “UCSB had previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred” in the same area, but that no “reasonable precautions had been taken” to protect students.</p>\n<p>“Instead, UCSB tolerated the ongoing dark and overgrown foliage area and fostered a dangerous and crime susceptible environment for its students,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n<p>The complaint states that it would have been “neither cost prohibitive nor difficult” for UCSB to “keep this area clear, lighted, and safe for UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the attack in 2014, the campus police department <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\" target=\"_blank\">released a sketch</a> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">of two of the three men</span></span> and distributed wanted posters throughout I.V.

She was recorded on a security camera at around 4 a.m. running back to her residence in I.V., where her roommate called police and medical personnel.</p>\n<p>The victim was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where a rape kit was performed, but the lawsuit says the rape kit is “missing significant documentation including photos of her significant injuries.”</p>\n<p>As a result of the attack, the student’s eyes were swollen shut, her nose was broken and she suffered blunt trauma to her knees, hands and abdomen, according to the lawsuit. The student also contracted herpes from one of the attackers and had to take preemptive anti-HIV medication, although the lawsuit does not say she contracted the virus.</p>\n<p>The student is requesting damages from the university for personal injury, negligence related to the premises of the university and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Although the lawsuit does not specify the amount of money requested from the university, it states that when figures are known, the plaintiff will “amend this Complaint and allege said amounts.”</p>\n<p>A full copy of the lawsuit was <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://www.keyt.com/blob/view/-/37650938/data/2/-/10fupes/-/Rape-Case-Complaint-Against-UC-Regents.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">made available by KEYT</a></span><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">.</span></p>\n<p>An initial case management conference is scheduled for May 27 in front of Judge Donna Geck, according to the Santa Barbara Superior Court <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a></span>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67672\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67672\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/","id":3625,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[3624,3623,3622],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
