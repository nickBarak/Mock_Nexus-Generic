In those six games they were outscored 43-20.</p>\n<p>Being away from home is usually enough to get UCSB off its game, as it only has an 8-11-1 record; however, a close 4-3 win at UCLA this past Tuesday might have come at just the right moment so that it can go into the UCI game with some confidence.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the Gauchos have struggled immensely against the Anteaters posting a 14-28 record. It also does not help that Santa Barbara has not won a series at UC Irvine since 1986, but will definitely look to change that this year as its playoff lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>As most of these conference series go, the home team usually holds the advantage in terms of winning, as the past has consistently shown. Last season, UCSB swept UCI at home; two of wins had only one-run differences. However, two years ago when the series was at the Anteaters’ home, they swept the Gauchos in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>UCI will rely on its batting success to get it through this series, as it currently boasts the top batting average (.280), the top on-base percentage (.363) and the second best slugging percentage (.374) in the conference.</p>\n<p>One big factor in that is sophomore Keston Hiura, who has a .382 batting average, third best in the Big West. His home runs (seven) and RBI’s (37) are also third best in the conference, while his slugging percentage (.580) is the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s success in road games usually comes down to how the young pitching staff reacts to the pressure of the large road crowds. In their 20 road games this season, the pitching staff has allowed 91 earned runs compared to only 96 earned runs at home through 26 games.</p>\n<p>This month in particular, the inexperience and lack of depth has really shown itself, as the pitching staff has a combined 5.52 ERA, 54 earned runs and has allowed six home runs through 10 games. In the month of April, the throwing rotation had a 3.38 ERA, 53 earned runs and only four home runs allowed in 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the return of two solid pitchers from injury, redshirt junior James Carter and redshirt senior Justin Kelly, can help the struggling rotation. In his three appearances since his Tommy John surgery, Carter has been pitching five solid innings, allowing only five hits and no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>Kelly has also been solid as in 5.1 innings pitched he has allowed one run and four hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be no easy task for the Gauchos, but it certainly is necessary if they want to make a run at the postseason. They also need to get back to their winning ways so that if they make the postseason they can do more than just be one and done.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field on Friday, May 20 at 6:30 p.m., Saturday, May 21 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, May 22 at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game will be live-broadcasted on Fox Sports Prime Ticket while Sunday’s will be live on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Normally, after winning Saturday’s game, you would expect UCSB to come out firing. However, this was not the case.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat the Gauchos on their Davis home grass 13-3, administering the second worst loss of the season to their opponents and outhitting them 17-6 over the course of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB started strong, taking a 2-0 lead after the top of the second inning thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno earning an RBI single and later scoring a run himself.</p>\n<p>The Aggies roared back in the bottom half of the frame, scoring four runs, two of which came from sophomore Brad Pluschkell’s two-RBI double down the left field line.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless third from both teams, UC Davis went on to score two runs in the fourth, two in the fifth, three in the sixth and two in the seventh to take a commanding 13-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one measly run in the top of the eighth to make it 13-3, but it was not nearly enough to dig themselves out of the huge deficit they faced.</p>\n<p>UC Davis had many big hitters over the course of this game, including freshman Logan Denholm, who went 3-5 (.600) and finished with four RBI, two runs and one big, two-shot home run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Tanner Bily had a perfect hitting day, going 3-3 with two runs scored and an RBI. Sophomores Pluschkell and Justin Allen had an identical night, both going 3-5 (.600) on the day and scoring two runs and batting in two.</p>\n<p>Freshman Kyle Hatton (3-1) had a tough outing for the Gauchos. The left-handed pitcher picked up his first loss of the season after allowing four hits and four runs in 1.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Relieving sophomore pitchers Kyle Nelson and Kenny Chapman did not fare any better, combining to allow 12 hits and nine runs, eight of which were earned runs, in only 4.2 innings.</p>\n<p>Only one UCSB hitter, redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford, registered more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s terrible blowout, Santa Barbara managed to tie the series at one after defeating UC Davis 7-3 in a game that was pushed back two hours past the original start time due to rainy conditions.</p>\n<p>Once the game commenced, the Aggies looked ready to play, taking an early 1-0 lead after freshman Alex Roeser was walked on with the bases loaded, picking up an RBI. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Joe Record forced the next batter into a fielder’s choice to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>After the teams traded two scoreless innings, the Gauchos went off in the fourth inning, scoring four runs to take a 4-1 lead. Redshirt juniors Ryan Cumberland and Andrew Calica both hit RBI fly outs while freshmen Michael McAdoo and Thomas Rowan hit RBI singles.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara added a run in the top of the sixth which UC Davis quickly countered in the bottom half of the frame with a run of its own to make the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>Freshman Caleb van Blake hit a sac fly in the bottom of the eighth inning for UC Davis to cut the lead to 5-3 and give his team some hope down the final stretch.</p>\n<p>However, sophomore Austin Bush put the game away in the top of the ninth inning, blasting a two-run homer to right field and ending the game at 7-3 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The home run by Bush, the team’s first baseman, was his fifth of the season and now is the new team high. It was the sophomore’s only hit of the day, but it was a big one.</p>\n<p>Record (5-4) was able to pick up his fifth win of the season after going six innings and allowing only one earned run while striking out seven batters. Nelson picked up his team-high fifth save of the season.</p>\n<p>Before evening up the series, Santa Barbara struggled to stop UC Davis in the final two innings of the first game, leading to its eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked fine in the first innings, especially in the second when they scored two runs thanks to sophomore Clay Fisher’s RBI single and Calica’s RBI walk to take the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the next four innings neither team scored, meaning UCSB kept its 2-0 advantage. Junior pitcher Shane Bieber was great throughout the first six innings, allowing only three hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>It looked as though the pitcher was going to cruise into his career-high and Big West-high ninth victory until the bottom of the seventh, when UC Davis rallied three runs off three hits to take a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were unable to retaliate in the top of the eighth, which meant the Aggies could extend their lead in the bottom half.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettencourt pitched only 0.1 innings but allowed three hits and three more runs to UC Davis, which put them up 6-2 after eighth and it was enough to seal its victory.</p>\n<p>Senior Spencer Henderson played a big role in both those innings, earning his team’s first run of the day after an RBI double which scored Denholm and the team’s last run after an RBI single which also scored Denholm.</p>\n<p>The left-handed pitcher/first baseman went 3-4 (.750) on the day with two RBI and one run scored. Denholm went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos road woes keep plaguing them this season as 11 of the team’s 12 losses have been away from Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Its road record is now 7-11-1 on the season, the fourth worst in the Big West.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that UCSB is a contender and a tough opponent, but as some point it will need to prove it can win on the road on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>The NCAA Regionals, Super Regionals and College World Series will not be held at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, so in order for this team to be as successful as it wants to be it must be able to go on the road and win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is Tuesday, May 10 against CSU Bakersfield at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

They are currently playing the worst baseball they have all season after going 2-5 in the last seven games, and with three of those losses coming at home, a place where UCSB had only lost once this season prior to this current stretch of games.</p>\n<p>The Titans are now 32-17 overall with a 14-4 Big West record, good for first place in the standings. With six games remaining in conference play, CSUF now has a three-game lead over second place LBSU — who they have yet to play — and a four-game lead over UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sunday’s game was a big one for the Gauchos, as they still had a chance to win the series over a very good Fullerton team. They also needed to bounce back from an embarrassing 18-2 loss on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara started off the game slow, allowing two runs in the first inning to Fullerton. CSUF then extended its lead to 3-0 after adding a run in the third inning.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos finally struck back as a two-RBI double by junior utility player Billy Fredrick brought them back to within one run.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning, UCSB tied the game at 3-3 after a solid RBI double from redshirt junior outfielder Devon Gradford.</p>\n<p>Although three runs were enough to win Friday’s game, it was not enough to beat the Titans on Sunday, as they rallied off one run to take a 4-3 in the seventh courtesy of a wild pitch from redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson.</p>\n<p>After that, CSUF never looked back. In the eighth inning they scored two more runs to take a 6-3 lead after an error by the UCSB second baseman scored two Fullerton runners.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went cold the last three innings, mustering only one hit, which led to their eventual 6-3 loss.</p>\n<p>Nelson (6-1) picked up his first loss of the season after allowing the go-ahead run in the seventh. On the CSUF side, junior pitchers Dylan Prohoroff (1-1) and Scott Serigstad combined to allow only one hit in the final 3.1 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Before losing the series on a tough game, Santa Barbara suffered its worst loss of the season after being blown out on their home turf by a final score of 18-2.</p>\n<p>The Titans were able to score at least one run in seven of the nine innings of the match and their seven-run outburst — which came when they were already up 7-2 — in the sixth inning is what put away the Gauchos for good.</p>\n<p>The 18-run, 21-hit game allowed by the Gauchos is the most they allowed all season in both those categories, with their 16-run loss being their worst run differential loss of the year.</p>\n<p>CSUF designated hitter Ruben Cardenas had a career day, setting career highs in hits and RBIs. The freshman went 4-6 (.667) with six RBIs, three runs scored and a big two-run homer in the seventh inning, his second of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman Tanner Pinkston also had a great game, going 4-5 (.800) with three RBIs and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the nine innings, Titan pitchers combined to allow only four hits and two runs while striking out seven batters. Nothing went right for the Gauchos on either end of the mound.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s embarrassing loss, UCSB actually managed to gain the early advantage on CSUF after sneaking by with a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the second inning as redshirt sophomore third baseman J.J. Muno hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Titans responded in the fourth inning after junior infielder Timmy Richards hit his team high eighth home run of the season to tie the game up at one.</p>\n<p>UCSB then hit another home run, this one courtesy of freshman catcher Sam Cohen — the first of his career — to re-take a one run lead at 2-1.</p>\n<p>CSUF tied the game at two after another RBI from Richards, but the Gauchos freshman infielder Tevin Mitchell hit an RBI ground out to take the 3-2 lead after the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Nelson then picked up his sixth save of the season after pitching the final two frames, allowing only one hit.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber (9-3) pitched a great game, allowing only six hits and two runs in seven innings pitched while also striking out six batters. The win gave him the 20th of his career, and he is now tied for eighth in UCSB program history for career wins.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara squandered an amazing opportunity to really move up the rankings and break the slump it has been in. Instead, its two home losses this past weekend tied its loss total in the first 24 home games of the season.</p>\n<p>The home-field advantage the Gauchos used to have seems to have dissipated as they have now lost three of their last four home games.</p>\n<p>As the season nears its end, UCSB has to figure out its issue of poor play soon or its once promising season will end in a disappointing fashion.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is against UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium on Tuesday, May 16 at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When going forward with the planning of this, I really wanted to just make it a space of memorial and remembering,” said Jeike Meijer, former Associated Students (A.S.) external vice president for local affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office has been working on recreating the original memorial events that students put together in the aftermath of the shooting. One of those recreations included putting up posters of the original blackboard messages that students left for the victims in 2014 by the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re basically replicating that this year because we wanted to bring back the initial reaction and memory of the five year anniversary,” Meijer added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vigil and walk from Storke Tower to Anisq’Oyo’ Park <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/281778196041141/\">taking place</a> on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. is also a tribute to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-25/isla-vista-community-gathers-to-mourn-share-memories-of-those-lost/\">initial vigil</a> that took place two days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president for the I.V. Community Services District, spoke about how I.V.’s  high turnover rate means it can be harder for students to learn about the tragedy when they first come to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My generation of students wasn’t here for the tragedy. And we were the ones who sort of were watching from a distance. I know I remember the day that it happened, I remember reading about it on the news and actually talking about it with my friends just because the details were so horrific,” said Brandt, who will graduate this spring with the class of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we keep talking about it and that we keep recognizing just the horror of what happened, because it is so important to how our community has developed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the sorority Delta Delta Delta, more commonly known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/tri-delta-to-suspend-operations-at-end-of-school-year/\">Tri Delta</a>, closing down at the end of this year and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/coffee-collab-mural-commemorates-tragedy/\">Coffee Collaborative</a>’s future uncertain, I.V. is losing some of the physical markers of remembrance people once used to learn about the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the months after the shooting, a memorial swing bench honoring two Tri Delta sisters who lost their lives in the shooting, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper, was given to the Tri Delta house. Coffee Collaborative has a mural dedicated to the six victims and has intentionally left a bullet hole in the window from that day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every four years, we have almost an entirely new town in terms of the population and who lives here,” Brandt said. “I’ve been happy to see that at least in the instance with the Tri Delt bench that it’s found a home </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last that I heard </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with parents of one of the victims.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the student population at UCSB essentially resets every four years, many staff and faculty members who were here in 2014 are still here today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life, has been working at UCSB for 28 years and has worked to help the community heal for the past five years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time this year, Armistead said, the Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (A.S.A.P.)  is putting together <a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/events/asap-may-23-iv-tragedy-commemoration-and-reflection-five-years-later\">an event</a> for staff members to “reflect, connect and nourish.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event is described as an informal space for staff and faculty members to come together and will be facilitated by A.S.A.P. Manager Kirsten Olson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t feel as cohesive because now we’ll be with students who are honoring and respecting and remembering, but they weren’t necessarily here,” Armistead said. “And so this space created for staff and faculty is pretty special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, arrived on campus during Fall Quarter 2015 and said it has “been a learning process for [her] in terms of what were the impacts and how have those changed over time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. might be losing some of its physical reminders of the tragedy, Klawunn pointed to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/\">lights in Pardall Tunnel</a>, which were installed as part of a memorial project in 2015, and the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/\">Love and Remembrance Garden</a> in I.V. as examples of how the community has created its own ways to remember and honor the victims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to acknowledging the experiences of faculty and staff members who were here in 2014, Meijer touched upon the experiences of the first responders who were there as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] some of them, that’s the worst night of their life. They were the ones there; they were the ones who were seeing everything happen,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As two students who weren’t at UCSB in 2014, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel said she and Meijer had been speaking to people who were at the university and could talk about the ways in which the community came together in the days after the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bringing that community back together when you’re remembering is really important and making sure that that legacy and that history is being passed down so that no new generation of UCSB students ever forgets what happened,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said that while people would talk about the shooting during the year, there wasn’t a “place to center yourself and focus on remembering the people’s lives” outside of the annual vigils.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to keep reminding students that this tragedy happened in their community just five years before is by holding these vigils and memorial events, Kopel and Meijer both said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t want to present it in a way that’s gonna make people not want to see it or not want to remember, because healing in that way is always so hard,” Kopel said. “But I think that just by people walking past those boards, for example, maybe first years, they’re gonna stop and see it and they make initial contact with it once and they’re gonna now know that for the rest of their four years here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It really only takes one instance of contact or a story passed down or knowledge passed down for that to continue on. And I don’t think that people in this community are ever gonna forget that this happened.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
