Yang sent a message to the BSU Demands Team yesterday, promising funding for BSU’s eight proposed positions within the office, $55,000 annually for BSU programs and that the university would “work toward the vision of a Center for Black Student Development over the next several years,” according to the message.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These proposals were part of the most recent <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\">set of demands</a> BSU released to the university in February, but built upon over 50 years of efforts from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For BSU President Mariyah Lewis and BSU Demands Team leader Samantha Sanchez, seeing the fulfillment of these demands warranted a moment for the two to pause from their efforts and celebrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cried for about two and a half hours,” Sanchez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commitment the university made to the Black student community by fulfilling these demands speaks to a greater awareness of Black students and their unique needs as a student community on campus, Lewis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a good feeling to say the least, to know the administration is pushing for us and striving for better support of Black students on campus,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said BSU’s demands represent a vital aspect of university’s commitments, which include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“creating a culture that affirms the intrinsic dignity in each of us, celebrating differences, and making UC Santa Barbara an inclusive environment in which to live, work, and learn,” he wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to Black student groups and community members, Sanchez acknowledged the strides made by UCSB administrators in its support of Black students, noting that these commitments are a symbol of courage as well as progress toward equity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes strong leadership and courage on the behalf of administration to understand and implement a structure to repair those deficits and restore the Black community’s faith in the education system. Today, our university administration displayed both this leadership and courage,” Sanchez wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Sanchez said the fruition of these demands will pave the way for “monumental initiatives across the UC system to create greater access to higher institutions of learning and overall achievement for Black people and people of color.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez said that the hiring process for positions in the Office of Black Student Development can start immediately. The positions will be developed within the Division of Student Affairs, and  hiring will be led by BSU members and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The positions within the office include a director, an assistant director, two academic support counselors, a recruitment and retention specialist, a coordinator of Black student life and two advocacy counselors. The budget for the positions totaled about $900,000, according to BSU’s list of demands, and will be provided by the Chancellor’s Office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Lewis and Sanchez emphasized that their work to help the Black student community is not over. Changes are still needed within universities to create equity among minority student populations, and BSU is far from short of ideas for how this change can happen, Lewis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many more things that we can imagine.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It is to admire the heroics of some of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to save others.”</p>\n<p>Professor Butch Ware, who teaches African history and the history of Islam at UCSB, began his speech by saying that the “topic of today’s brief address is love.”</p>\n<p>“Only love is capable of conquering hate, and the reminder comes from the Quran, the book brought by the Prophet Mohammad believed by Muslims to be God’s verbatim speech,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>“What kind of sense does it make for beings made of dirt to rank one another hierarchically above other beings made of dirt?” he asked. “The Quran reminds us over and over again that we were brought out of this earth and will be put back into it … White supremacy is the greatest historical expression of Satan’s own religion.”</p>\n<p>Ware emphasized that although Islam is mocked as a religion of violence, it is, in fact, a religion of love and peace.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack… No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in the vigil, 51 attendees lined up on either side of Storke Tower, each holding a white rose. As each victim’s name was read, each rose was placed in a vase in the center, for a total of 51 white roses.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, who spoke following the victims’ names being called, noted that this May marks five years since the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, when six people were killed.</p>\n<p>“As a community that knows the profound impact of hate armed with guns, we at UCSB also know how important it is to stand with and for each other at moments when hate threatens — whether it is sexism as it was in Isla Vista in 2014 or Islamophobia as it is today, we need to speak up and speak out against intolerance,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>“We need to counter the white supremacist ideology that fueled this horrible attack,” she added. “No excuses and no tolerance can be given to white supremacy and we are seeing the danger in allowing even its smallest manifestations to pass.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn also referenced a call for gun control, which drew applause from the crowd. She said she hopes the United States follows the steps that New Zealand is taking “so that it will not be so easy for those who want to commit terrorism in the name of hate to get weapons.”</p>\n<p>“This hurts,” Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said. “I’m grieving … as a mom to 23,000 students, as a colleague, as someone who has Muslim friends.

Not a lot of people know, ‘How do Muslims grieve when a person passes away?’ ”</p>\n<p>She and the other organizers made it a point to incorporate aspects of Islamic funeral rituals, both with a Janazah prayer and by having an active member of the MSA’s mosque read Qur’an verses and perform a du’a.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86962\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86962\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86962\" data-attachment-id=\"86962\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/in-photos-msa-hosts-vigil-in-solidarity-with-muslims-of-new-zealand/nzmemorial-03182019-angiebanks-23/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86962\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NZMemorial-03182019-AngieBanks-23.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The vigil ended with a Janazah prayer and a silent march to the MultiCultural Center. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The vigil itself came together in a mere 72 hours.</p>\n<p>When the MSA first learned about the attack, members were outraged, Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We had to really calm everyone down and be like, ‘Hey, guys, I know that all of your anger is justified, but being angry isn’t gonna solve anything. We need to do something that honors the victims, not focus on the shooter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>Rabie was the one who first introduced the idea of the vigil, although Faiz was worried that the turnout would be low, given it was finals week.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, the students met up to sketch out the agenda for the vigil and write their speeches.</p>\n<p>Faiz said she initially didn’t realize how much she was grieving: “The weird thing about grieving is that you don’t realize you’re a little off until after you get better, ‘cause that’s when you realize, ‘Oh, this is how better feels.’ ”</p>\n<p>“[On Thursday], it was kind of like feeling numb, like the grief hasn’t completely hit yet,” she said.</p>\n<p>Later that night, as the stories began pouring out about the lives of the victims, and as she read up on them, “that’s what really brought out the grief.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing how each person kind of has an emotional aspect or a loved one or a story, that’s what you start to relate with. That’s what really starts making you cry.”</p>\n<p>The vigil today operated as sort of the “last part of our healing,” Faiz said.</p>\n<p>“We were able to feel good and see all that positivity. That kind of washes away all the fear and sadness.”</p>\n<p>As she put together the list of people who died in Christchurch, Faiz said it was then she realized just how many lives were lost.</p>\n<p>“If we just said ‘51 people passed away,’ you don’t really understand the magnitude of it. But when you read each name out and realize how long the list is going, that’s … when you realize, ‘Wow, this is so many people and stories.’ ”</p>\n<p>Faiz said the support the UCSB community has given her and the other students was “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>As they worked to organize the vigil, Faiz said the administration was more than willing to help the event come together.</p>\n<p>Klawunn, in particular, reached out to Faiz even before MSA had contacted UCSB administration, saying that she was thinking of the MSA after hearing about the attack.</p>\n<p>“The fact that it’s not just that I have to notify them, but they’re already aware of it and reaching out to me, that meant a lot to us,” Faiz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Students and faculty can search for open access online, use a inter-library loan or asking a librarian for more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Day in and day out, our librarians are finding content that’s behind paywalls, content that is out there that students, faculty [and] the UCSB community need to find,” Rick Stockwood, communications and marketing manager at the UCSB library, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone stumbles across a paywall like we all do almost everyday, trying to reach something, the librarians are here to help find that content.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Librarians at UC libraries are also able to purchase specific articles for access using the budget that would normally go to funding the contract with Elsevier, according to Antelman.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the library acquisition budget will also go to investing in open access initiatives elsewhere and working with a subcommittee of the Academic Senate to create a fund to facilitate open access of UC research articles, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC researchers have to pay an article processing charge to Elsevier in order to enable open access to their articles, which Antelman said usually costs around $3,000. This fund would help researchers cover this cost.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through the subscription dollars the library is currently paying, we would help subsidize those fees and they would be lower so that if the researcher wanted to publish open access, they would pay much less,” Antelman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The push for open access of UC research articles started in 2013 when the UC Academic Senate adopted a policy which iterated UC’s commitment to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible,” according to the official policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will soon sign onto an “</span><a href=\"https://oa2020.org/mission/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expression of Interest,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” according to Antelman, which asserts the importance of creating open access for research article and leaving the subscription model of the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UC signatories of the document include UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles and most recently UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC isn’t completely closing to door to Elsevier, however. UC still retains access to most articles from Elsevier before 2019 and room remains for more negotiations in the future, Antelman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hopeful that over time, Elsevier will possibly come back with another proposal and that we could possibly have a successful deal concluded, but at this point, it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
