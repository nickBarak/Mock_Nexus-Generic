Its popularity maintains a stronghold in I.V. and at UCSB, and it can still be found in the homes of 40-year-old dealers on Abrego Road or in the dorms of 18-year-old freshmen on campus.</p>\n<p>Oft ignored and rarely talked about outside of the C.A.S.E. classroom, the drug has infiltrated the area. In 2005, for instance, 78 percent of drug-related bookings to juvenile hall were for meth, while more than half of Santa Maria’s Drug Court participants who tested positive for drugs were found to have meth in their system.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Beyond the personal problems related to health and general well-being, meth causes a headache for the county both for its financial and social costs. Officials hope to cut the problem off at the knees, but are finding the eradication – or mere stemming of it – increasingly complex.</p>\n<p><b>Antifreeze, Drain Cleaner and Kitty Litter</b></p>\n<p>Created by the Japanese a century ago, and used by Kamikazes before they made their last flights, meth was recently named California’s “drug of choice” by a report from the county’s Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit. But you don’t have to tell Santa Barbara County officials that; community leaders have been decrying meth’s prevalence for years.</p>\n<p>Meth is a stimulant that activates the central nervous system and drastically increases the amount of dopamine – a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and positive reinforcement – in the brain. And thanks to that jolt of euphoric dopamine, meth is more addictive than many other drugs.</p>\n<p>“The sensation of anything by comparison – pleasurable sex or easy money – is dwarfed by the amount of dopamine meth releases into the brain,” said John Doyel, the treatment coordinator for Santa Barbara Alcohol, Drug &amp; Mental Health Services. “It is more addicting than alcohol or marijuana.”</p>\n<p>Crystal meth appeals to all sorts of people, from the weight-conscious woman who uses the drug to curb her appetite to the student who uses it as a study aid to the curious preteen, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“It is a culturally synchronic pandemic that fits in beautifully with American society, as it appeals to things we value, like optimism,” Doyel said.</p>\n<p>What’s more, anyone can brew methamphetamines with a mixture of household items, including detergents, cold medicines and kitty litter. And addicts can get high almost any way they please: Meth can be injected, inhaled, or ingested. Of course, purchasing it isn’t that difficult either: a few doses run for about $20.</p>\n<p>In the short term, meth can induce irritability, insomnia, confusion, tremors, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse or even death. Meth users also often develop “meth mouth,” in which their teeth rot out of their head as a result of the drug and the user’s poor dental habits and the consumption of sugary drinks, which users crave on binges. Even if a user quits the habit, he or she is still subject to a slew of long-term effects, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies, lowered resistance to disease and organ damage to the lungs, liver and kidneys.</p>\n<p>But then, the user isn’t the only one who suffers. Families in Santa Barbara have been torn apart over the drug; about half of the 300 child out-of-home placements as of July 1, 2006 were done so as a result of abuse or neglect resulting from a parent’s meth use.</p>\n<p>Some I.V. residents have noticed the influx of the drug into their beachside town. In a report given to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, former UCSB student Shanna McGuiness said she had seen the drug – and its effects – in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have recently heard that meth has been circulating in I.V., and I am hoping that it does not become the new trend, because I have seen the effects it can have on families,” she said. “It’s disturbing to know that this is the drug people in California are using, because it has the potential to be more harmful than other things.”</p>\n<p><b>Meth and U(niversities)</b></p>\n<p>Because of meth’s widespread appeal – and the “Superman” feeling associated with it – meth addiction has spread like a weed in California, which the National Institute on Drug Abuse said has one of the highest rates of meth usage.</p>\n<p>Colleges are a hotbed for meth usage, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“This is a drug that has always been a problem in California; they used to deal it everywhere up at Stanford because kids used it to study harder,” he said. “There is still an old speed limit sign posted up on frat row that says ‘Speed, $5 a hit.'”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program assistant director Al Rodriguez described the typical meth user in the Santa Barbara area as “a young adult, typically male, unemployed and from North County,” the issue hit close to home last year when university officials discovered a meth lab inside a residence hall room, after the two occupants had been kicked out of the university due to low GPAs.</p>\n<p>A former neighbor of the dorm room meth producers, who wishes to remain anonymous, said although he knew his neighbors dealt drugs from time to time, he had no idea that people in the building were involved in the production of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“I knew they experimented with a lot of stuff, but didn’t know about the lab until they got kicked out of school,” he said. “Every new drug was a new story. I was never home at the same time as them, so I didn’t know them very well, but they told me they had used meth once or twice and said it was kind of crazy…</p>\n<p>“I knew a lot of people who used meth last year but never thought it was a problem,” he said. From observing his neighbors’ use, he said he could tell the drug “is really addictive and makes people really awake and really hyper.”</p>\n<p>The student said it was somewhat frightening that no one would have known about the existence of the on-campus lab if the pair had not been kicked out.</p>\n<p>Other students reacted similarly upon hearing about last year’s incident.</p>\n<p>“It really scares me that something like this could have happened on this campus , because I had no idea that a crystal meth lab could have been next door to me,” said Sandra Stokes, a second year linguistics major. “I had no idea that meth was a problem in this area, let alone on our campus.”</p>\n<p><b>A Santa Maria Export?</b></p>\n<p>But outside Isla Vista and UCSB’s domain, the problem is not nearly as hidden. According to 4th District Supervisor Joni Gray, crystal meth has created a “crisis” and is a “burden for the county because of the way it destroys peoples’ lives.”</p>\n<p>In certain parts of Santa Barbara County – particularly North County and the Santa Maria area – Gray said meth helps contribute to high levels of violent behavior and abuse, in addition to the overcrowding of county jails.</p>\n<p>According to a January 2007 county report, meth use has mushroomed in a relatively short span of time; in 2001, 19 percent of patients in county drug treatment programs claimed meth as their primary drug, but in 2006 this increased to 31 percent, making it the drug of choice in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Currently, about 55 percent of Drug Court participants in Santa Maria who tested positive for drug use were found to be on meth; in Lompoc – a possible location for a new detox program site – the statistic is 42 percent, while in Santa Barbara it is 33 percent.</p>\n<p>“It destroys families because parents lose their sense of right or wrong,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Gray recalled an incident involving two parents who accidentally killed their child while under the influence of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“They literally rolled over [in bed] and suffocated their own child while sleeping,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Apparently the tragedy is not entirely unheard of. Last March, Lompoc resident Jason Gomez rolled over on his infant twins and suffocated them to death while under the influence of methamphetamines.</p>\n<p>Kelly Rodriguez, a recovered meth abuser, told the Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit that the drug practically ruined her life: She lost her children, went to jail and became homeless.</p>\n<p>“Using meth was the most self-destructive thing I’ve ever done,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Biting Back at “Meth Mouth”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors is currently looking for a solution to the meth “epidemic.” The Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit’s report painted a dour picture of the current resources.</p>\n<p>“Services were being strained and circumstances such as county jail over-crowding, waiting lists for detoxification and overwhelming caseload for child welfare services were attributed to meth abuse,” the report states.</p>\n<p>One possible new approach, highlighted in the report to the board, is a project called “From ‘Me’ to ‘We.'”</p>\n<p>“It’s a new benchmark for bringing together a broad-based coalition of public and private agencies, organizations and other stakeholders to fight the impact of methamphetamine,” Gray said of the program.</p>\n<p>The “broad-based coalition” aims to bolster its ranks with forums held throughout the spring to get the public support and to create more strategies for combating the problem.</p>\n<p>Others note the answer isn’t an easy one. Regardless, Rodriguez of the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program said the meth problem in the county needs to be proactively addressed.</p>\n<p>“Our collective approach to our meth problem needs rethinking,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14150\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14150\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/","id":3555,"author":{"id":348,"name":"Casey Ibbetson"},"related":[3554,3553,3552],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":348,"name":"Casey Ibbetson","biography":"Not available","articles":[3555],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Home sweet home redefined","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At any given moment in Isla Vista, thousands of students jostle their keys to apartments owned by one of several dozen landlords.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At any given moment in Isla Vista, thousands of students jostle their keys to apartments owned by one of several dozen landlords. And while in the next few years the number of students will increase, the landlords may be cut down to a select few survivors.</p>\n<p>On the heels of corporate student housing’s increased interest in I.V. – with Conquest Student Housing moving in to manage 6626 Picasso and other properties and Allen &amp; O’Hara Education Services’ purchase of Fontainebleu – the rental housing climate in I.V. is ripe for yet another change.</p>\n<p>Historically, dozens of different owners have simultaneously laid claim to I.V. In the 1920s it was the possibility of oil that encouraged investors to buy property in the largely uninhabited area, and in the 1950s it was the promise of student renters with the opening of UCSB next door. Now, citing success in other college communities, officials at recently interviewed corporate student housing companies say they would like to expand their influence in Isla Vista, a move that could revolutionize the variety of ownership and, according to some local authorities, increase competition and shift the feel of community in the area.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The supply and demand for housing in this one-half square mile town is also facing shifts at the hands of the university and the I.V. Master Plan. By Fall 2008, UCSB will add around 1,000 new spaces to its arsenal of housing for undergraduates and graduate students with the San Clemente project on El Colegio Road, and about 380 additional spaces for faculty and staff will follow in the next few years. And as part of the new I.V. Master Plan, which is currently in the approval process, within the next few years I.V. zoning changes may accommodate up to 4,330 new residents.</p>\n<p>For now, the California Costal Commission’s cap on the UCSB student body as part of the 1990 Long Range Development Plan remains at 20,000, but campus administrators working on the new goals for the university’s growth say the student body may see an increase of 5,000 once the plan gets approved.</p>\n<p>Of course, in a community that is 95.4 percent renters, demand for housing remains high despite the continually raising rent prices – the rental vacancy rate, according to the 2000 census, is at 1.2 percent, while the national rate is at 4 percent. And though the housing market has recently changed, investors are still willing to pay comparatively high property purchase prices to be a part of this unique area.</p>\n<p><b>The Corporate Side</b></p>\n<p>“Many campuses have interesting and eclectic student housing neighborhoods like Isla Vista,” said Craig Cardwell, president of Allen &amp; O’Hara. “There are none that I can think of that are in a setting such as UCSB and Isla Vista, with the mountains on one side and the ocean on the other side, with the pleasant weather, diverse population, and an enormously large number of students – UCSB and SBCC – in a restricted growth living environment.”</p>\n<p>Because most investors consider student demand to be in fairly constant supply, especially at a developing university like UCSB, economics professor Stephen LeRoy, who specializes in finance, said student housing investors are just betting that the prices on their properties will eventually rise.</p>\n<p>“The university is not going to shrink – it’s not a stupid bet,” said LeRoy, who lived on Del Playa Drive for four years. “There’s also housing being built, so put that into more students fighting over more housing.”</p>\n<p>This interplay between corporate student housing companies with large holdings in the community and existing owners could create more competition for student attention, said Kris Miller-Fisher, director of special projects for Third District Supervisor Brooks Firestone. This, she said, will yield higher quality living for renters.</p>\n<p>“Some people have owned their properties for a long time,” Miller-Fisher said. “The new owners want to keep their units filled, so my guess is it would make it more competitive, and better for students.”</p>\n<p>Conquest’s first building in the area, Breakpointe, located on the 6600 block of Abrego Road, was completely renovated two years ago before the first residents moved in, and after the previous occupants were offered the chance to break their lease early. The company’s newest acquisition, Coronado, is currently being remodeled amidst several protests due to the August evictions of its 55 units of tenants, most of whom were low-income Latino families, from the 6626 Picasso Rd. complex. The building is scheduled to open for renters in the fall.</p>\n<p>Conquest Student Housing Manager Eric Johnson said the company, which manages 19 properties in the USC area, hopes to replicate its USC success as the “number one housing provider” in Isla Vista by maintaining an attention to detail.</p>\n<p>“We can meet an untapped need – high quality, safe student housing,” Johnson said. “[With Breakpointe and Coronado], we took buildings that had not been upgraded in many years, and added a whole new facade, a state-of-the-art fitness center with individual plasmas on each machine, brand new unit interiors with all new appliances and fixtures in the kitchens and baths, Ethernet, Dish Network television, a new fire pit, a BBQ area by the pool, etcetera.”</p>\n<p>Johnson said three-bedroom apartments in both buildings are sold out, with five apartments left at Breakpointe. Coronado has been leased to about 70 percent capacity, but he said he expects it will sell out soon.</p>\n<p>Neither Conquest nor Allen &amp; O’Hara are new to student housing. Conquest has been at USC since 1993, and Allen &amp; O’Hara has been around since 1963, and it was the original developer of Francisco Torres from 1968 to 1998. UCSB acquired FT in 2002, and with it came the rowdy reputation still intact to this day. Allen &amp; O’Hara has 66 communities at college campuses across the United States.</p>\n<p>Allen &amp; O’Hara purchased Fontainebleu, the privately owned residence hall-style complex, located at 6525 El Colegio Rd., several years ago. Like on-campus residence halls, Fontainebleu offers students living in suites meal plans, cleaning, cable and utilities. Tropicana, located at 6585 El Colegio Rd., has a similar layout and is also privately owned.</p>\n<p>Cardwell, a UCSB graduate, said he feels large companies have more resources available to them to improve the environment for their renters.</p>\n<p>“A private owner can do an excellent job providing a good student housing environment, and many do,” Cardwell said. “A large company such as ours… with a complete culture dedicated to the student experience, and access to many sources of short and long term capital, probably has a better chance of providing a successful experience for students over a longer number of years.”</p>\n<p><b>The Flip Side</b></p>\n<p>Not everyone is a fan of the corporate model, or they are at least careful to give praise. Chuck Eckert, chairman of the executive committee of the I.V. Property Owners’ Association, said he thinks the attention to management of the buildings is more important than the size of the company.</p>\n<p>“My personal opinion is that much more important than who owns the property is the management policy,” Eckert said. “You can have good management that manages five units or 500 units; it depends on the policies and the people. … To do a good job managing you have to manage enough units so that you have somebody paying diligent attention to management and maintenance issues.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB Dean of Students Yonie Harris said she is concerned that larger companies focusing on the business of student housing may miss the importance of history to a community. For instance, she said she thinks the 6626 Picasso “no cause” evictions came out of a misunderstanding and lack of sensitivity to I.V.’s community, which consists of a large percentage of renters.</p>\n<p>“I think what companies miss is an understanding of what the full community is,” Harris said. “You can’t just go from place to place. … If you provide housing in a small community you have to understand the community. Large companies may miss that. I.V. has a history and the students who live there have values.”</p>\n<p><b>Historically Speaking</b></p>\n<p>Vestiges of I.V.’s past still remain, posing challenges for investors and planners alike. The town’s characteristically skinny streets, lack of parking, and quickly constructed buildings are a result of the 1950s building boom, which came shortly after the UC Regents announced plans in 1948 to relocate UCSB from Santa Barbara’s hills to its current location.</p>\n<p>Despite original plans to keep UCSB to the size of a small liberal arts school with around 3,500 students, in 1958 the Regents announced that the student body cap would increase to 10,000, bringing an additional 2,000 to 3,000 faculty and staff members to the area as well as a desperate need for housing.</p>\n<p>With the exception of Manzanita Village, UCSB Housing and Residential Services Director Wilfred Brown said the university built all of its on-campus residence halls during this peak period – the school’s opening in 1954 through 1968 – all the while making I.V. property owners eager to cash in on the overflow renters’ need for housing.</p>\n<p>Dean of Students Yonie Harris said the zoning originally put in place by the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to regulate I.V.’s development was not adequately enforced and repeatedly disobeyed by owners racing to put up properties.</p>\n<p>“There was a relax of zoning regulations and builders in I.V. were allowed to not build to code,” Harris said. “Builders were allowed to ignore setbacks, the parking regulations were relaxed. In order to get enough building to occur, certain policies and regulations were relaxed or overlooked.”</p>\n<p>Harris arrived in the area shortly after the 1970 bank burning and rioting in protest of the Vietnam War. She lived in I.V. for 27 years and was involved in the Isla Vista community before she started at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It always struck me how perfect it is for college students,” Harris said of Isla Vista. “It’s on a human scale. Community involvement is very easy to slide into … when you’re part of a community it leaves an imprint on you and how you view the world.”</p>\n<p>By the numbers, in 2006 Isla Vista drew approximately 2,000 more students than its closest competitor, UCSB. According to Community Housing Office survey results, in Fall Quarter 2006, 8,450 students lived in Isla Vista, 6,372 students lived in university-owned housing, 2,407 lived in Goleta and 1,489 lived in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Most students want the ‘college experience’ of living in I.V.,” CHO Manager Roane Akchurin, a UCSB alum, said. “Living in their own apartment is part of the experience. It’s been there, and it’s been a legend.”</p>\n<p><b>Market Forces</b></p>\n<p>The current incarnation of a limited housing supply, sky-high demand and a history of pro-development county polices makes I.V. a plum for savvy real estate investors, especially for larger companies looking to expand.</p>\n<p>These companies have their plates full in terms of financing, said Brian Bailey, a Central Coast Investments real estate broker. Whereas an investor of a smaller building would be able to obtain as much as an 80 percent loan, he said lenders are much more cautious dealing with a business investor – sometimes requiring payments in cash and a larger down payment. He said it is important for the companies to have cash flow right away to start paying off their loans.</p>\n<p>Bailey, a graduate of UCSB, has represented buyers and sellers in Isla Vista real estate transactions for the past 30 years. As a student, he never lived in I.V. because of the noise, but when he got his real estate broker’s license in 1979 he started working there – much to more experienced brokers chagrin.</p>\n<p>“When I began, I.V. as a location on the Central Coast was pariah – my fellow brokers wouldn’t even drive out there,” he said. “The area was looked down on [and I was told my] reputation would suffer. I liked that because it meant no one else was going to do it.”</p>\n<p>As the tumultuous times of the 1970s fade into memory, so I.V. has become a more acceptable place to invest. Despite the area’s newly earned mainstream status, Bailey said the values for buyers are not as good as they once were.</p>\n<p>In the past two years, he said, there have been more properties up for sale – as many as six or seven at a time compared to three in the past – because the purchase market is slowly shifting to a buyer’s market, which means there are fewer buyers and property values have flattened or dropped.</p>\n<p>“Properties not at their highest and best use or needing further development or remodeling and properties in other than optimal locations, with deferred maintenance or other challenges, have not fared as well in the current market,” Bailey said. “The market for this type of property is still liquid, but is price sensitive. Apartment buildings priced in line with the current market will sell within a reasonable period of time. There are a larger number of properties available of this type than usual.”</p>\n<p>Allen &amp; O’Hara Education Services President Craig Cardwell noted that though rents may be relatively high, student-housing investment does not often produce short-term returns, which is something many new investors do not expect.</p>\n<p>“While the rents may seem higher than for other forms of real estate, the operating expenses, insurance expenses and capital improvement expenses to keep a student housing community in good condition are much more than for other forms of real estate,” Cardwell said. “So, on a net basis, student housing can be characterized as a form of investment that has reasonable, but not large returns on invested capital.”</p>\n<p>Bailey said real estate in general is never a good short-term investment because of its frequent up and down cycles. He tells people to expect to own the property for a minimum of 10 years, but suggests never selling and refinancing to free up more money.</p>\n<p>In addition to attracting those who are secure with the market, Bailey said I.V. attracts younger buyers who are comfortable dealing with students and their parents, as well as the specific maintenance issues such customers tend to create. According to the 2000 census, the median age of residents in I.V. is 21.1.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, in student rental properties there is less of a risk of rent collection than in a lot of downtown properties,” said Bailey, also a property owner in I.V. “Parents are, as a group, fairly wealthy, whereas in another location renters might not have the rent. A lot of people can’t mentally deal with renting to 20-year-olds, but my experience with that has been positive.”</p>\n<p>Student renters certainly present different challenges for owners and managers, said Chuck Eckert, chairman of the executive committee of the I.V. Property Owners’ Association. He cited the June and September move-in and move-out rushes as a hectic time for owners who have to prepare their properties for new renters in a very short period of time.</p>\n<p><b>Welcome to the Neighborhood</b></p>\n<p>The market forces, rental rates, community building rhetoric and decades of history piling up on the town’s sandy beaches and sometimes-paved roads don’t always trickle down to I.V.’s wards and critics. Most just cycle through to class, and cycle out of the system.</p>\n<p>Third-year business economics major Casey Bradshaw said she has been living in Isla Vista for three years and said despite the condition of most houses, she enjoys living on Sueno Road because of its location.</p>\n<p>“It’s convenient and close to campus,” Bradshaw said. “And there are a lot of parties.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy and art history major Devon Dickinson said he currently lives in Santa Maria and has never lived close to UCSB. Though he said he regrets not having the I.V. experience – while admitting that “it’s a mess” – he chose to commute because of the price and the peace and quiet.</p>\n<p>“I’m pretty studious,” Dickinson said looking up from his reader. “That’s one of the reasons I’ve insisted on living in Lompoc and Santa Maria. Also, housing here is pretty expensive.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-13564\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-03-08/home-sweet-home-redefined/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-13564\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-03-08/home-sweet-home-redefined/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-03-08/home-sweet-home-redefined/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-03-08/home-sweet-home-redefined/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-03-08/home-sweet-home-redefined/","id":3552,"author":{"id":347,"name":"Lindsey Miller"},"related":[3551,3550,3549],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tour de Fatality","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":null,"content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As the years have gone by and the county population has grown, the number of jail cells has remained almost constant, he said. Throughout his campaign, and during his first 100 days in office, Brown has placed the blame squarely on outdated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“The crux of the problem is that our jail infrastructure was built in the 1970s, and has had minimal additions,” Brown said.  “Our infrastructure has been outpaced by our population growth.”</p>\n<p>Along with overcrowding, the aging facilities have created a slew of other problems for the county, Brown said. Most drastically, the Sheriff’s Dept. has been forced to shorten non-violent criminals’ stays in the county jail, just to ensure that more inmates can fit in.</p>\n<p>“We have had to adjust our criteria for who we incarcerate and how long they stay. People that should be in jail aren’t,” Brown said. “When this starts happening, you start to lose the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.”</p>\n<p>Due to a cap on the numbers of prisoners allowed in each facility and a California Superior Court ruling, the county only has one other option besides releasing non-violent prisoners early – incarcerate fewer people.</p>\n<p>The county has sentenced law-breakers to other punitive programs, but the net effect is, as 3rd District Supervisor Brooks Firestone put it, that there are people on the streets that were sentenced to not be on the streets.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor Nikki Jones, who has a Ph.D. in criminology and teaches at UCSB, sees the situation in a different light. Since jails across the state are overflowing, and the crime rate has dropped, the problem, Jones said, does not lie in the size of county jails but instead in the criminal justice system itself.</p>\n<p>“Over the last decade or so, the crime rate has dropped off significantly from record highs in the early ’90s and late ’90s,” she said. “This introduces a serious contradiction: Why is it that our incarcerated population continues to grow even though crime isn’t increasing?”</p>\n<p>“Tough on crime” policies and mandatory sentences like the Three Strikes rule have more than made up for the drop in criminal activity, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“These policy changes increase the number of men and women who are incarcerated in our nation’s jails and prisons and puts pressure on local institutions, like county jails, that do not have the infrastructure to warehouse – as many of our facilities now do – the large numbers of people who enter its doors,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, Firestone said the problem has gotten so bad that there are 10 to 20 more convicts than there are beds every night in the county jail, forcing prisoners to spend the night on the ground.</p>\n<p><b>Possible Solutions</b></p>\n<p>In lieu of overhauling the entire criminal justice system, the most obvious solution for officials has been to build a new prison. The idea has been raised many times and in increasing fervor as the overcrowding has become more severe.</p>\n<p>The most popular plan of the moment calls for the new jail to be built in the northern portion of the county, near Santa Maria. Sheriff Brown, whose campaign pushed the jail issue hard, said the proposed North County jail could house 800 inmates, and decisively solve the overcrowding problem.</p>\n<p>But, naturally, it would not be cheap.</p>\n<p>The daunting $153 million price tag – which would also include an estimated annual operation cost of anywhere from $19 to 30 million – has kept the facility from becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which is ultimately in charge of the funding, feels that the bill is too steep, and Firestone said the public agrees. According to the supervisor, a poll was given to the public asking whether they would be in favor of an increase in the sales tax to fund the proposed prison – the poll came back a resounding “no.”</p>\n<p><b>State-Funded Jail</b></p>\n<p>However, recent state legislation has given Brown another shot at fulfilling his campaign promises. Under a deal reached last month between the governor and state legislators, $7.4 billion of state funds will go into prison and rehabilitation programs, and $1.2 billion of that has been earmarked for local jail beds – the largest sum of money ever allocated by the state for jails.</p>\n<p>Due to the severity of area’s problem and the amount of work the county has already put into trying to solve it, Santa Barbara is well positioned to receive some of those funds, Brown said.</p>\n<p>The proposed state-funded facility would have 800 beds and the county would only have to pay for three-eighths of the construction and a portion of the operational costs.</p>\n<p>But, as Firestone and Brown have both said, “The devil is in the details.” The catch is that of the 800 total beds, 500 would be reserved for state prisoners, as opposed to county prisoners. The legislature also requires that the facility would have a re-entry station, aimed at better preparing convicts for their re-entry into society.</p>\n<p>The opposition has argued that the state funding comes with too many strings attached, but Brown argues the prison would still be a great benefit.</p>\n<p>“Sure there could be some additional costs, but we would benefit from an economy of scale. We are getting a long-term solution for a much smaller cost,” Brown said. “It is a great benefit to us to accept a joint facility with the state.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the current recidivism rate – the percentage of released prisoners that return to committing crimes and are caught – at 70 percent, Brown and state legislators have applauded the required re-entry stations.</p>\n<p>The high recidivism rate is a particular problem for Jones, who said that educational programs inside prisons would help reduce the number of readmissions.</p>\n<p>“Since 95 percent of people who enter jails and prison eventually are released, and our jails and prisons – especially in California – offer little educational or treatment programs for people who are incarcerated, we have set a large number of men and women up for failure once they are released from these facilities,” she said.</p>\n<p><b>For Now</b></p>\n<p>To help persuade the public to accept the deal, Brown has created a “blue-ribbon” panel of experts from various disciplines to look into the proposed solutions. He said he hopes that the public will see the multi-disciplined group and know that the sheriff is not just asking the county for unnecessary funds, but that the proposal is well researched and well founded. He believes that this approach is much more marketable to the public.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, at least until the North County jail issue is solved, Brown is looking for short-term solutions.</p>\n<p>One of his originally proposed options is already off the table. On the campaign trail, Brown proposed shipping inmates over to a vacant jail facility in Tulare County, which was empty due to a lack of funding in the county. Since then, the county has procured funds, and all beds in the jail are accounted for.</p>\n<p>Now, the sheriff’s short-term solutions include an agreement with the Lompoc City Jail to house county inmates; efforts to use more home incarcerations; a remodeling of older facilities; and a change of the Lompoc County holding facility from a Type I facility to a Type II facility. The change would allow the facility to hold prisoners for longer than the current 96-hour limit, he said.</p>\n<p>But no matter what the county builds, Jones said the underlying societal problems will remain.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, this is not a problem that we can build our way out of,” she said.</p>\n<p>Until jails offer college courses, General Education Development programs, mental health and addiction treatments, the problem will never truly be solved, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately,” she said, “the real solution to this problem must come from outside the criminal justice system.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/","id":3554,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3553,3552,3551],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
