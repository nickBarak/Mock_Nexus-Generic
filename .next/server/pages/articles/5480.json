Despite a season-high 24 kills from senior outside hitter Jeff Menzel, the Gauchos fell to the Anteaters 3-1 (27-29, 25-18, 25-19, 25-14).</p>\n<p>With four regular season matches remaining, UCSB now sits at 13-11 overall and 10-8 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.</p>\n<p>The first set displayed an exciting brand of volleyball with 24 ties and 10 lead changes as UC Irvine took a late lead, 27-26. Behind Menzel’s nine kills and a crucial serving ace, the Gauchos fought back and earned a 1-0 lead in the match with an emphatic game-winning kill by senior outside hitter Cullen Irons. UCSB also got a boost from sophomore middle blocker Dylan David, who recorded four blocks on the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We came out ready to go. That first game was a battle,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “But after the first game we lacked a spark. We can’t do that anymore. We have to fix that before the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine dominated the second set, never allowing the Gauchos to take a lead. Junior outside hitter Carson Clark led the Anteaters with a pair of aces and four of his 19 kills in the second game. Senior outside Cory Yoder added 15 kills in the match for UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“They served really well and got us in some trouble,” McLaughlin said. “Once that happens we become predictable. We hung in there the whole time. Jeff carried us, but Irvine was a better team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled in the third set, posting a team hitting percentage of .167, while the Anteaters hit .435 in the set and .390 for the match. The decisive fourth set was more of the same for the Gauchos, who only scored 14 points. Extending its winning streak to three matches, UC Irvine is now 15-11 overall and 11-8 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“They put a lot of pressure on us from the service line and we didn’t pass well,” senior libero Andy McGuire said. “We let down after that first set and never really got into a rhythm throughout the match in games two, three and four. We have been even this year on the road and at home. We’re excited to improve these next weeks and get ready for the playoffs, whether we are home or away.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos this week are matches against Pacific and Stanford. UCSB hosts the Tigers on Thursday at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Daniel Wade” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a rel=\"attachment wp-att-35217\" href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2011-04-03/menzel/wade_01aprilvolleyball_-5/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"35217\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-03/menzel/wade_01aprilvolleyball_-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Wade_01AprilVolleyball_-5.jpg?fit=800%2C469&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,469\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1301688854\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"Wade_01AprilVolleyball_ (5)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A UCSB player dives for the ball in a 3-1 loss to UC Irvine at Robertson Gymnasium on Friday night.

However, the two-time defending champion came short to No. 1 USC in a nerve-wrecking game that came down to the last six seconds of the match ending 8-7 in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>In the opening game on Friday, Stanford came out ready to dominate the competition, nearly shutting out the Gauchos in the first half.</p>\n<p>The first goal came at the 5:19 mark, which initiated a 3-0 run in the first quarter for the Cardinals. The second period started off the same way, with Stanford controlling the tempo of the match allowing it to score another six goals before the end of the first half.</p>\n<p>Midway through the second quarter, UCSB drew the first exclusion of the game. The Gauchos capitalized on the play and junior utility Miranda Schrader found junior attacker Brenna Thomas on the left wing to put Santa Barbara on the board for the first time.</p>\n<p>However, Stanford’s stout defense restricted UCSB to the lone goal, maintaining its eight-point lead going at halftime by a score of 9-1.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was more favorable for the Gauchos as they seemed more settled and showed glimpses of what got them to the first-round matchup.</p>\n<p>“I think we came down a little bit from the excitement of being here. We found our rhythm and matched their tempo,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense held off the Cardinals in the third quarter, limiting them to only two goals, both of which came toward the end of the period. Then senior utility Samantha Murphy initiated an offensive breakthrough for the Gauchos, in which they outscored the Cardinals 4-3 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Murphy went 2-3 in the game. Her second goal came in the fourth where she faked out the defense by looking one way and sending the shot to the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The other two goals came courtesy of Schrader with a shot from the right side and junior attacker Jenna Solberg, who got the last goal after she stole it and went for the point herself with only six seconds left on the clock. Solberg picked up a team-high of two steals, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had one along with six saves.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to be playing here at the NCAA Tournament for the first time,” Kay said. “And we know that today was part of the process in getting experience with the bright lights and everything that comes with playing in the ‘Big Dance,’”</p>\n<p>UCSB faced No. 10 UC San Diego the following day in the consolation bracket. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson led the team with two goals and two assists, but it was not enough to take down the Tritons in a 10-5 loss.</p>\n<p>It was Hudson who opened up the scoring for both teams at the 6:47 mark in the first quarter. From the right wing, she shot to the far post where it was impossible for UCSD’s keeper to reach.</p>\n<p>The Tritons answered immediately, scoring their first goal 38 seconds later on a power play. This was the first of six goals that UCSD would make as a result of its 6-on-5 advantages out of the seven they registered.</p>\n<p>After four consecutive plays in which the Tritons scored, the Gauchos were able to break the 4-0 run in the second quarter with a steal from Schrader right in front of the cage. The Gauchos counter-attacked, and a pass from Brokaw to Hudson left the attacker in a one-on-one match against the goalkeeper, completing the play and trimming the score to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Yet again, however, the Tritons reacted with another goal of their own to gain a 5-2 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior center Lauren Martin picked up a goal early in the third period after drawing one of her team-high three ejections in the match to make the score 5-3. Despite an early fourth quarter goal by junior utility Taylor Shore and a last-minute goal by Solberg, the Tritons had managed to score three more before the end of the third period ended and two more in the fourth to secure their victory.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB faced the No. 13 San Diego State Aztecs for seventh place, in which the Gauchos finished their 3-0 season sweep of the Aztecs with an 8-2 win.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the nerves that came with being in the Big Dance seemed to finally disappear for the Gauchos in the final match of their season. The defense shut out the Aztecs in three of the four quarters with the help of Brokaw who collected 10 saves and a steal.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the team worked together to tally eight goals in total, six of them coming in the second half. Martin, Shore and junior defender Sophie Trabucco all recorded a pair of goals.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did not win the tournament, it was a great learning experience for the younger ones who hope to make an appearance again next year and an unforgettable memory for those that are graduating.</p>\n<p>In one season, they broke several records and completed what no other team in program history had accomplished. A major puzzle piece to that success is the Gauchos’ squad of graduating seniors in First Team All-Big West selections Brokaw, Murphy and Martin. Martin was also named to the Second Team All-Tournament.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, next season looks to be just as promising as the Gauchos will welcome back returning players like Thomas, Shore, Schrader, Solberg, Trabucco and the talent from freshmen Ashley Riley and Sarah Kreiser.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Tritons managed to add a goal before the end, but it wasn’t enough as UCSB escaped with the 11-9 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s always a big confidence boost to win in front of a home crowd, especially on opening day. After achieving that feat for the third year in a row, it’s apparent that Santa Barbara is always ready to give its crowd a good showing. But, for now, it’s time to go back on the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ next game will be the Mountain Pacific Invitational beginning on Friday, Sept. 23 at Berkeley, CA.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Golden Bears will look to improve upon their 11-1 record.</p>\n<p>However, for UCSB, overcoming its 12-year winning drought vs. Cal will be no easy feat. In what will be the only regular season matchup between the two programs this year, the anticipation surrounding the Gaucho-Golden Bear showdown has certainly increased after meeting each other a total of four times last season.</p>\n<p>Entering Saturday with an advantage will be Cal as it won each of the four matches.</p>\n<p>Despite already experiencing a loss to the Golden Bears last Saturday, the Gauchos remain confident in their capabilities to overcome their hump but know they must sustain consistency against Cal’s ongoing attack.</p>\n<p>“[Last Saturday it was] 9-8 in the third quarter. [We] gave up a couple of sloppy goals,” Asssitant Coach Ryan McMillen said. “It’s a four quarter game. We had three good quarters, [so] we’re working towards having four solid quarters on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ potential to upset the Golden Bears remains probable behind the recent play of senior utility Reed Cotterill. A transfer from Golden West College, Cotterill is emerging as one of Santa Barbara’s top players after playing in 28 games, scoring 25 goals and tallying seven assists in his first season at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Cotterill leads the Gauchos in scoring with 15 goals and recently helped Santa Barbara get back on a winning track with a hat trick performance against No. 14 Princeton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Aiding Cotterill has been the play of junior attacker Shane Hauschild. A Santa Barbara native, Hauschild finds himself second on the team in goals with 14 and is the team’s leader in shots and assists.</p>\n<p>While much time remains on the Gauchos’ schedule to develop as a team, Hauschild understands his role when in the pool and is looking to establish himself more as a team leader.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a new role for me this year,” Hauschild said. “In my first two years I scored a lot because I was the young kid that other teams thought they could leave me and let me try to beat them by myself. This year, me and Reed are getting more of that attention because we’re the older players. [Teams] kind of know who we are are so that’s opening things up for a lot of other guys on our team. I think this year will be a lot more balance scoring wise between everyone as opposed to one or two guys having way more goals than everyone else.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB will hope to establish balance on offense, it will need to ensure it does the same on defense as it prepares to face one of the nation’s best players.</p>\n<p>A pivotal asset within the Golden Bears’ success over the Gauchos all last season and currently having a strong 2016 campaign thus far is sophomore attacker Johnny Hooper.</p>\n<p>Building off an excellent freshman year in which he was crowned the 2015 MPSF Newcomer of the Year, Hooper’s current team-high of 37 goals ranks atop the conference in scoring along with his league-leading 3.08 goals per game.</p>\n<p>While Hooper serves as the Golden Bears primary attacker on offense, Cal possesses an arsenal of scorers that can emerge during any period of the game. Overall, the Golden Bears offense has accumulated a conference-high 192 team goals in 12 games played and lead the MPSF with 16.0 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Even without Hooper included, six other Golden Bears have recorded double-digit goal totals. Following Hooper’s team-high at 15 goals apiece are redshirt freshman Jordan Hoover and true freshman Safak Simsek.</p>\n<p>Set to face one of the most lethal offenses in the nation, it’s inevitable that the Gauchos’ defense will be tested. Cal is one of three teams this season that has reached UCSB’s season-high of 15 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>While no team can truly put the Golden Bears’ offense to a halt, Santa Barbara did return to the drawing board in pursuit of different results come Saturday. But it may take more than a week’s worth of practice for the Gauchos to reach their final form as a team as they have been doing double the work out of the pool.</p>\n<p>“It’s early in the seaosn for us,” McMillen said. “We just got done with our hell month. Most other school weren’t going through that, they were through two hard weeks. We were going eight hours a day for the first four weeks with a day off each week. Now school just started, we’ve done a little bit of a taper and we’re only going about two and a half hours a day.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal’s matchup will begin at noon this Saturday, Oct. 1, at Spieker Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 29, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/no-7-gauchos-head-to-cal/","id":5479,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5478,5477,5476],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
