The deputies asked the 19-year-old if he had any identification with him and he told them, in thick, slurred speech, that it was in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The intoxicated reveler then reached into his pocket and, in so doing, pulled his pants down to his knees. Embarrassed, the pantsless partier tried to re-cover himself but was simply too drunk to do so. Luckily, the I.V. Foot Patrol are trained for all manner of situation, and one of the deputies was able to assist in pulling the exposed man’s trousers back up.</p>\n<p>With one disaster averted, the deputies moved on and asked the beltless boozer if he knew what street he was on. He replied he was on “Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>While no doubt a reasonable drunken answer, the deputies formed the opinion that the wasted walker was just too drunk and arrested him for public intoxication. He was later transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>An I.V. Wizz</b></p>\n<p>Sun, Jan. 24, 12:47 p.m. — Deputies on a uniformed patrol watched as an inebriated reveler veered off the sidewalk, stumbled over some landscaping and face planted into a hedge of bushes.</p>\n<p>The officers, standing near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde, made their way towards the not-so-sure-footed drinker as he worked his way out of the bush. Getting to his feet, the 20-year-old made a step back towards the sidewalk, caught his foot on an innocent shrub, and went toppling back towards the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived, helped the defeated drunk to his feet, and asked his name. He responded by muttering something undistinguishable. Not terribly surprised by the answer, the officers shrugged it off and asked him where he lived. While not quite a real street, his reply “Sabo Ardo” was at least close.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the deputies picked up on the rancid smell of urine wafting through the air, and a quick glance at the reveler’s crotch confirmed he was the source. The urine stains were not confined to his jeans, however. Dark spots on his jacket sleeves suggested he had also managed to piss on his arms.</p>\n<p>Taking extra care not to get too much urine on their hands, the officers slapped cuffs on the pee-stained partier and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/","id":3827,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3826,3825,3824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller","biography":"Not available","articles":[3554,3571,3752,3825,3827,3828,3829,3830,3831,3833,3835,3842,3887,3902,3903,3905,3906],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Despite Budget Cuts, I.V.

Grey said the money would be used to add additional renovations like a shade structure and garage doors for outdoor use, a classroom space and upgrades to the kitchen, bathroom and lighting.</p>\n<p>The timing of the CDBG denial brought some concern to Isla Vistans following President Donald Trump’s America First budget proposal, which included slashing 13 percent of the Housing and Urban Development budget.</p>\n<p>Part of the budget cuts includes eliminating funding for the CDBG program. According to the federal Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) budget blueprint, the program “is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results.”</p>\n<p>Several Isla Vista projects have received funding from the CDBG program in past years. Jay Freeman, an I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board director, said some of the programs the CDBG has funded include the I.V. Youth Projects and the I.V. Sidewalk Improvement Project currently underway along Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“[CDBG] is designed in order to provide infrastructure and housing upgrades for dense, underprivileged and complicated communities,” he said. “Not having that program anymore is going to make it a major complication to how we allocate resources.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson made additional statements on Thursday regarding the proposed cuts during a press conference in Miami, the <em>Miami Herald </em>reported.</p>\n<p>“What you need to concentrate on is: The parts of these programs that are functioning well — and that are maintaining people — are going to be preserved,” Carson said. “There may be a different nomenclature. We may not call it the same thing … We are clearly going to maintain these programs that are going very well.”</p>\n<p>In response to Carson’s statement, Freeman said it is not clear what he means.</p>\n<p>“For all we know, that means that they intend to keep some tax cuts that’s in there,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>The proposed elimination of the CDBG also comes during a time of budget shortage in Santa Barbara County. The county is currently looking at approximately $40 million in cuts, said Cameron Schunk, district representative for First District County Supervisor Das Williams.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we try our best to balance the budget and a lot of that money comes from grant funding,” Schunk said. “I think the key thing for people to understand is that this all translates into real world services that you and I use every day. It’s very easy to feel disconnected until you go to access a county service, and they say, ‘We don’t provide that anymore.’”</p>\n<p>Throughout the week, the county will be conducting budget workshops to consider proposals for the 2017-18 spending plan. Schunk said the departments were asked to overcut, so the proposed budgets include approximately $8 million worth of extra funding.</p>\n<p>“What we wanted to do was cut heavily and then be able to restore things that we thought were very critical,” Schunk said. “So of course we were going to have to make huge cuts, and there’s going to be big losses, but the idea is that we could minimize that by cutting huge [and] then going, ‘Okay, which thing do we want to restore or expand upon?’”</p>\n<p>One of such requests came from General Services, which asked for an additional $18,000 of general funds to be allocated for the community center’s ongoing maintenance. Jonathan Abboud, who serves as director on the board of the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), said the money is necessary to preserve the center’s basic operations.</p>\n<p>“We’re sending a lot of people to the county budget hearing to speak up for Isla Vista,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of funding from the CDBG and proposed cuts to the county, I.V. stakeholders are still rooting for the community center’s success.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CDBG, the county also applied for the state’s Housing-Related Parks Program (HRP), offered to cities and counties with affordable housing programs. The grant could potentially bring in approximately $1.1 million to the I.V. community center project.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD director, who also plans on attending the county’s budget hearing on Wednesday in support of the community center, said people are excited about the HRP grant and believe it will revitalize the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to see that it come to fruition,” Brandt said. “But in addition to that, I also think it’ll be important that the county continues to support the community center project even in their tough budgetary times. It’s important that the Isla Vista community lets the county know this is one of our priorities.”</p>\n<p>Besides the HRP grant, Isla Vistans are seeking other ways to fund the center through independent fundraising efforts. Brandt, who also serves as the director on the IVCDC, said the organization is actively soliciting donations from the community.</p>\n<p>“[We’re] letting folks know that Isla Vista is a great place to invest your money,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Schunk, who is also involved in the fundraising campaign as IVCDC’s president, said the denial of the CDBG is “not the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>“But certainly, I hope it lights a fire under folks and makes them understand that funding is critical,” he said. “Without it, there will be no community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/","id":3824,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[3823,3822,3821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. - A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Mind the Door</b></p>\n<p>Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. – A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the car – a four-door Chevy truck – and shined their flashlights into the back seat. There, lying face down, was a victim of overconsumption, dreaming drunken dreams.</p>\n<p>His head half hanging out the opened door, the 19-year-old man was a sight to behold. Chunks of vomit clung to his face, covered his hands, stained his T-shirt and saturated the car seat. A few select chunks had made their way out of the car and were pooled in the gutter.</p>\n<p>The officers shook the sleeping beauty awake, taking extra care not to get vomit on their hands, and collected the out-of-towner’s information. Hoping not to have to arrest him, the deputies asked if the defeated reveler had any friends who could assist him.</p>\n<p>The puking prince told them José would come to his rescue and he pulled out his phone to dial him. However, after shouting his name several times, the officers asked to see the phone and discovered the soiled young man had never dialed the number.</p>\n<p>With no José, the deputies had no recourse but to arrest the young man.

A simple tap on the window didn’t wake the slumbering out-of-towners, however, nor did aggressive banging.</p>\n<p>The IVFP doesn’t employ quitters, though, and after nearly two minutes of trying, the deputies were able to wake the sloppy sleepers. What was awaiting them inside the car, however, no one can be trained for.</p>\n<p>First was the smell, horrid and acidic. Next the visual, two young bodies covered entirely in their own puke. Vomit was in their hair, on their clothing, covering their seats and pooled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Two grown adults could live with such an experience – at least their parents wouldn’t have to know. But these vomit-covered visitors were not so lucky: each was only 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Slightly taken aback, the deputies arrested the pair and transferred them to the Santa Maria Juvenile Hall, where they were housed, pending a serious ass-whopping from the ‘rents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, it was the worst oil spill in the nation’s history until 20 years later, when the Exxon Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil off the coast of Alaska.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio oil spill of 2015 that spilled 80,000 gallons of crude oil, state and federal legislators enacted new laws, and Santa Barbara County worked alongside local environmental organizations to draft a plan of action in the event of a future pipe leak, as the <i>Nexus</i> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite such efforts, Zinke proposed on March 6 a region-wide, 73-million-acre lease sale offshore of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development.</p>\n<p>This lease sale will go into effect Aug. 16, 2017, which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said will grant leases to the highest bidder for exploration.</p>\n<p>Davis said the SBSC put out a petition asking Zinke to not open up new offshore leases in the Santa Barbara County in hopes of preventing future pipe leaks. She said the petition has over 17,000 signatures.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to deliver it and that he gets the message that if they are going to open up [leases], there is going to be a real push back and a lot of opposition,” Davis said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77064\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77064\" data-attachment-id=\"77064\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/environmentalists-protest-arctic-oil-drilling-naysayers-wine-about-it/fullsizerender-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77064\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local environmental groups spoke out against plans to expand offshore oil drilling amidst a visit by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to Santa Barbara on Monday. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Of the 470 leases issued in the Pacific Ocean, 43 are active.
