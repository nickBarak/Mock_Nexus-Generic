Incorporating introspective subject matter into refined and precise production exemplifies the masterful work on the album as well as the artist’s previous project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The enticing tempos that sway from the melodic “Underground” to the hard-hitting “Heaven’s Gates” constantly keep the listener enthralled, rather than merely falling victim to the problem that many of his contemporaries face of utilizing the same generic FL studios bass-heavy beat. WebsterX’s thought-provoking lyricism derives from a genuinely honest perspective, so it resonates vividly with his listeners. He is a symbol of originality in the rap world, as his diverse take on production and poignant content converge to form utter uniqueness.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is titled as such for two reasons, one being the visual reason. I like how the word looks and sounds. My friend Kenny captioned a photo ‘Daymares’ and posted it. I saw the word and immediately gravitated towards it and knew right then and there it’d be the title of my debut project,” he explained. “The second reason being the meaning behind it. Daymares are nightmares that are happening during the day, and the album touches on the first and only real big dark period I went through in my life, in years 2014-2015, in that 2013-2017 period of my career thus far. I couldn’t function much during the day because I was plagued by my first experience with depression, anxiety, self-doubt and simple growing pains, worrying about dropping out of school to pursue music and having to tell my parents that, because music was going crazy for me locally. Worrying about the large local reception of my debut mixtape </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desperate Youth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and how to follow up, all that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2014 single “Doomsday” has garnered north of one million streams on Spotify and induced the buzz that established WebsterX as a significant presence in the minds of many music fans and critics. The artist’s delivery on the track is innovative and captivating. Ominously enchanting cadences float above the track’s instrumentation and blend with the artist’s light falsetto, confirming the track as an enthralling hit, despite its dark lyricism. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebsterX explained, “‘Doomsday’ was written during that dark period of mine, originally intended to be the first single for the first version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I made and eventually scrapped; it blew up pretty much from the blogs. The video that I made with my videographers Damien Blue and Cody LaPlant also set the song ablaze; they do all my videos and absolutely go crazy. The song sits over a million now on Spotify and is the reason for kickstarting my career into national attention.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creative process for WebsterX emanates from writing in a peaceful state of mind while concurrently reflecting on any hardship he previously encountered. WebsterX said, “ I can only write from a happy, driven and calm perspective. So during the depressed and anxious-ridden points, I never wrote. Once I overcame that period I reflected and wrote about it all from a clearer perspective, which made </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the last question I mentioned I scrapped a first version of the project; that would be because I tried writing it from a dark mindset, and to me it was just too dark and slow. The version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daymares </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is out today is more of a life album because lyrically it’s not all about that dark period in time.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78439\" style=\"width: 587px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2054044219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78439\" data-attachment-id=\"78439\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-43/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=792%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78439\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-577x1024.jpg?resize=577%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=577%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=141%2C250&amp;ssl=1 141w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg?w=792&amp;ssl=1 792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of writing in this clear mindset, rather than one submerged in calamity, ultimately made a project that depicts a narrative of a young man experiencing the trials and tribulations of adult life, specifically addressing the tangible effects of sadness on one’s mental state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of WebsterX’s parents are Ethiopian immigrants, making him a first-generation American, but he is not the first in his family to pursue a career in music. About how his roots in Ethiopian culture impacted his creativity, he said, “Ethiopia is a one-of-a-kind place in Africa and around the world. It’s looked at as a mecca to some Rastafarians, the cradle and start of humanity to the science world and a place full of beautiful people, music and culture to me. My parents are both Ethiopian; my father was a professional club soccer player and famous musician in the country and my mother’s side of the family is a coffee business of royalty. My father without knowing it instilled kindness, wiseness, love and creativity into me. My mother brought toughness, empathy for people and directness to me. With that I feel I balance both very well, and my older sister put me onto all the cool stuff I know today at a very early age.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi reflected on melancholic realities with progressive instrumentation and cathartic flow that pushed musical boundaries, thus making him one of the top influential rappers for younger generations. The Milwaukee rapper WebsterX cited Kid Cudi as one of his major influences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kid Cudi emerged at a time when people who were born between 1990-1997 were experiencing middle school and high school,” he said. “For a rapper to come out with this lonely stoner, cosmic tone to his music and a melodic delivery along with good-feel raps, he simply had the relatable factor on his side.” He continued, “Being associated with Kanye was also crucial because Kanye was running our generation’s iPods at the time and pretty much still does. Cudi’s music was also very chorus-driven; [which was] a big and addictive reason why I think they resonated with a lot of people, including me. From his style to the music, he felt like one of us even though he was 24 at the time that this was all happening for him.” Similarly, WebsterX has crafted his own unconventional style, yet he remains an impactful voice that is simultaneously emphatic and relatable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, WebsterX joined his friends from Injury Reserve to perform a couple of live shows around the SoCal area. “IR are the super homies,” he said. “Those dudes [and] their team are incredibly talented and everyone who is fortunate enough to realize that, realizes it. They didn’t teach me anything necessarily, but what was happening was more of a realization of who they are as people and why their music sounds the way it does. Both camps got closer and still retain that relationship to this day. To me, they’re one of the most refreshing, straightforward, exciting groups out today. Both of our shows in Cali were major, especially the LA show, sheesh.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injury Reserve and WebsterX share a dynamic of creating spaces to craft seamlessly gravitative rap songs that are entirely divergent from their contemporaries. They are the embodiments of unapologetically challenging what rap </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sound like, as they offer sonically experimental tracks with progressive lyrics that open up thoughtful conversation about themes that are relatively taboo in the rap realm, such as depression and insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A rapper and his hometown go hand-in-hand like a symbiotic pair; take Chance the Rapper and Chicago, Jay Z and New York, Kendrick Lamar and Compton for example. WebsterX hails from the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city that is stereotypically known more for its cheese than for being a forerunner in producing rap artists. WebsterX explained his deeply rooted origins in the city of Milwaukee and the distinct passion he holds for the location, citing a plethora of exemplary and incredible artists to come out of the Milwaukee community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Milwaukee is a full-blown city, fifth largest in the midwest,” he said. “Briefly, Milwaukee can be described by its four locations: North, West, East and Southside. Northside is predominantly black. Southside is predominately Latino. Eastside is the coming-of-age college town, yuppy central and affordable hip neighborhood. Riverwest is where all the music is popping mostly out of the city across all genres and downtown Milwaukee is on the Eastside mostly. The Westside is sort of jokingly no man’s land, a mixture of north and west. If you were coming from out of town, mostly everyone would recommend the Eastside of Milwaukee to you for artistic spaces, live music, sporting events, pretty much everything entertainment wise. The Eastside brews and takes in the majority of the indie pop/rock, folk, metal, hip hop, rap, etc. acts in the city. We have our fair share of bigger acts coming out of Milwaukee as a whole such as IshDARR (Northside), myself (Eastside), Vinyl Theatre, who is on tour with Twenty One Pilots right now (Eastside), Field Report, a slight extension of Bon Iver (Eastside) [and] Grace Weber (Eastside) who was on Chance’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coloring Book, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as well as the very talented acts and personal favorites of mine who are really on the come up: Zed Kenzo, Taj Raiden, Platinum Boys, Soul Low, Milo, Foreign Goods, Boodah DARR, Kane and my collective New Age Narcissism consisting of Siren, Lex Allen, Lorde Freddee and Q the Sun. If you ask me about Milwaukee I’m gonna need a few paragraphs; I know too much.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78440\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1389042588\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78438\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78440\" data-attachment-id=\"78440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/websterx-and-milwaukees-hip-hop-renaissance/unnamed-1-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=937%2C1406&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"937,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78440\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1-682x1024.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1-1.jpg?w=937&amp;ssl=1 937w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of WebsterX</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked WebsterX about the difficulties that accompany a music career founded in such a city as Milwaukee. “The only thing that’s difficult is there are no real resources here,” he said. “You really gotta do it yourself or with friends. There’s lack of management, no booking agents, not many all-age venues and more. However, due to the recent successes of a lot of emerging acts, Milwaukee as a whole, musically, is being looked at more from the outside, and radio stations, venues [and] publications are aiding the local scene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rapper’s insight highlights something that is distinct in a multitude of artists from the area: an independent, DIY approach to creative expression. This element of creativity is something that has further expedited Milwaukee down the path of musical recognition and imbued the city with a distinct character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his own work, WebsterX harbors a refined and intriguing taste in art. Highlighting some of his current choices in music and film, the artist stated, “Musically I’m into </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Frank Ocean, Injury Reserve’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Floss </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, Playboi Carti’s tape, Syd’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sampha’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAMN. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Kendrick Lamar, but then again that changes each day. I always tell people to pay attention to my Soundcloud ‘likes,’ too, to see what I’m listening to. My taste in film really boils down to indie films, horror, coming-of-age films, documentaries and the occasional chick flick. My favorite films are the ones that are shot well, look ahead of their time visually or think ahead of their time. As you can see, I’m into lots of different things in my life.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a climate of perpetually evolving sound, WebsterX has asserted himself as an ingenious, thoughtful and inspiring force in the rap scene.

However, the enthusiasm toward the annual Delirium concert has come to replace this lost spirit of Halloween, and Delirium has become a benchmark of the UCSB legacy. In the words of UCSB undergrad Clare Doyle, “music brings people together, especially big names like YG … it’s cool that UCSB throws concerts like this. Kids really appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration the length of last year’s entrance line, eager Gauchos began lining up for the concert around 4 p.m., four-and-a-half hours before the concert was due to begin. Heightened security at the entrance initiated a wave of fears about the ticket exchange. However, excitement in anticipation of the performance was nowhere near subdued, and hundreds of anxious undergraduates began clogging the underground pathway leading to the Rec Cen fields.</p>\n<p>Concert attendees trickled timidly into the Thunderdome under a heavy security presence. But once inside, the atmosphere changed; the anticipation for Flatbush Zombies compounding the waves of excited heat produced by the pulsing mass of concertgoers. The stream of entering students diverged into two paths, one seeking relative safety in the partially extended bleachers on either side of the main stage, the other merging straight into the throbbing heart of the concert’s ground floor.</p>\n<p>As the stadium grew increasingly packed and excitement grew exponentially higher, everyone began to wonder when Flatbush was set to perform. A full half-hour passed in waiting for the opening act, yet the evaporating energy of anticipation became displaced, manifesting in the body-heaving fray created by Flatbush’s performance. Interventions by stage security, which were primarily to save raving concertgoers from being trampled, couldn’t dissuade the movement and flow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73689\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"339560544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73689\" data-attachment-id=\"73689\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/meganmineiro_delirium-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=350%2C467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"meganmineiro_delirium-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73689\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?resize=350%2C467\" alt=\"Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The throng excluded no classic Halloween character, but some concertgoers’ costumes were lost in the sweaty haze permeating the dance floor. To one freshman, Marlena, the green spotlights radiating from the stage as well as the smell “made the experience”.</p>\n<p>The Zombies began with some of their more well-known hits, but, ever off the beaten path, refused to stay structured, instead choosing to freestyle while performing on-stage acrobatics. The Zombies’ shirts disappeared at the onset of the show, and Gauchos center-stage received a hearty surprise when one of the trio wormed his way to the stage through the crowd.</p>\n<p>During Flatbush’s peak, two stage-wide mosh pits sprung up at the demand of Flatbush frontman Meechy Darko, who refused to continue performing without a “real mosh pit.” The pit soon devolved into rave-like chaos, with Darko interrupting the performance to address the crowd on numerous occasions. His interludes challenged the Gauchos to reanimate a yearning Halloween spirit and were answered with deafening roars by the pulsating mass of proud and primed UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Before performing their outro, “Palm Trees,” Flatbush halted their performance so that a glassy-eyed and drenched Darko could command UCSB to “forget everything else we said tonight; if we leave you with one message, it’s this: O<em>pen your f***ing minds”.</em></p>\n<p>But the main course was still yet to come, following another half-hour of waiting. YG’s act succeeded Flatbush with a crowd-hyping session by his crew’s DJ. Gauchos were taunted with an instrumental intro that brought on YG’s companion rapper.</p>\n<p>A surge buckled the crowd as 400 stepped onstage after another instrumental intro. YG began his act with performances of classic YG hype hits “Still Brazy,” “Left, Right” and “Toot It and Boot It.” A fiercely responsive SB answered with a new wave of mosh pits and crowd turbulence.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73684\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"99159227\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73684\" data-attachment-id=\"73684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2142/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2142\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73684\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Around the middle of the concert, YG brought his performance to a halt, addressing the SB crowd with “Y’all UCSB, right? Lot of Latinos in SB. I love Latinos.” A brief speech about Latinos spawned an anti-Donald Trump tangent met with great support from YG’s famously anti-Trump fanbase.</p>\n<p>YG attempted to quell a coming rant on the candidate by stating, “I’ll save that for the end of the show… in the meantime, I brought a friend with me.” YG then introduced East Santa Barbara native Sad Boy Loko as his guest rapper. While garnering limited recognition in the crowd, Sad Boy Loko regained the enthusiasm of YG previous performance by joining YG in singing some of the duo’s hits.</p>\n<p>After Sad Boy left, YG resumed the concert with a riled performance of “Bitch, Who Do You Love,” another of his most successful and more recent songs<em>. </em>YG periodically interrupted the performance by addressing the Gaucho audience, asking girls to “speak Ghetto” for him and to perform other tasks in tandem with the concert’s atmosphere. YG also included a crowd-hyping interruption to throw some of his personal merchandise into the audience. The rapper and his crew then electrified the students with an extremely well-received performance of “Don’t Tell ’Em,”  his collaboration with artist Jeremiah, going so far as to freestyle from Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73683\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1578037408\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73683\" data-attachment-id=\"73683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2235/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2235\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2235.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Toward the conclusion of the concert, YG revived the Donald Trump rant he had refrained from performing earlier, espousing to the Gauchos that, “a racist is running for office right now, a man who hates black people.” Following more commentary, he asked, “so who y’all voting for?” and delved into his infamous track “F*ck Donald Trump” to roars of “Hillary Clinton” and echoes of his catchphrase, “I like white people, but I don’t like you.” Following two more high-energy songs, YG was played out with the final words, “You great, Santa Barbara, look out for my mixtape dropping Friday.”  Right before walking off, YG concluded Delirium with the answer to his earlier question, settling all of the Gauchos’ Halloween unrest, “UC still brazy!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The festival was held all day on Saturday and was open to all who wanted to pay respect to loved ones or socialize with people from the community.</p>\n<p>Just outside the building were booths offering a variety of themed activities, one of which was face painting. The people within the booth talked happily while one artist focused on painting a sugar skull on a little girl, who excitedly kicked her feet back and forth from her spot upon her chair. A second booth sold dresses and purses, as well as sugar skull tapestries. The last booth sold offerings such as rosaries and, right next to the Virgin Mary candles, shot glasses for the ofrendas, or ritual altars.</p>\n<p>The small venue was filled to the brim with Day of the Dead decorations. Paper marigolds were placed in every available space, paper streamers lined the walls, two shelves were used to present giant paper mache sugar skulls and a large, hollow cross filled with sugar skulls hung on the wall. At the end of the main hall, there was an impressive display of a graveyard that included tombstones, streamers and pictures of loved ones, all enclosed by a picket fence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ofrendas lined every wall, covering every inch of the space with a colorful collection of offerings. Each altar held several pictures of relatives past and was well-spread with decorations of fruit, candles, pan de muerto (or bread of the dead) and various items the deceased enjoyed in life. One ofrenda in particular held a black-and-white picture of a man in his late 50s, propped up next to a classic glass bottle of Coca Cola and a crumpled pack of Marlboro cigarettes. This simple but sweet display was enough to get anyone to smile. On a separate altar was a framed photo of a teenage girl wearing a yellow dress; on the frame was a yellow bow to match. Several magazines were placed close by. A larger ofrenda was placed toward the middle of the venue and was labeled “Our Future Leader.” This altar had the most pictures; the most prominent was a group photo of about 10 smiling men. People not only paid respect to loved ones who have passed, but also to those who have had influences on their lives. On a long table in the corner of the venue was a picture of Frederick Douglass and beside it was a display of Bob Marley; the display was crafted out of a shoe box and decorated with Jamaica’s national colors.</p>\n<p>The folks around the festival all had smiles on their faces as they not only enjoyed each other’s company but also enjoyed plates full of tamales, tacos and other delicious smelling food. The energetic live music flowed through the building and echoed off the walls. Although the band was not the center of attention at the celebration, they still enjoyed playing for children, parents and families. They danced around the small stage and gave huge smiles to everyone around. There were a few people scattered throughout the crowd who appeared to take a special liking to the music, and showed their appreciation by nodding their heads or tapping their feet. The sugar-skull-sweet experience of Dia de los Muertos left me with a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my chest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/dia-de-los-muertos-celebration-gives-us-vida/","id":6714,"author":{"id":707,"name":"Kelly McPhail"},"related":[6713,6712,6711],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
