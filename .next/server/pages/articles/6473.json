Though incredibly difficult to stomach at some points, this memoir gives voice not only to Miller herself, but to plenty of other sexual assault survivors as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book begins with a recollection of events that happened leading up to the assault in 2015; from being excited to see her sister home for the holiday weekend to eating tacos to being dropped off at the Stanford frat house. It was during this Stanford frat party that Miller, her sister and her sister’s friends got drunk — Miller to the point of blacking out. As the night went on, Turner tried multiple times to dance with and kiss Miller’s sister, each attempt clearly rejected. However, it wasn’t until Turner found Miller alone that he was able to begin his assault, outside, near a dumpster on the cement floor covered in layers of Stanford tree pine needles. Luckily, as mentioned heavily throughout the book, two Swedish grad students — who were there at just the right time to save her life — tackled Turner and held him down until police arrived. Upon waking up in the hospital the next morning with no memory of how she got there or the assault, Miller then began the journey of being a sexual assault survivor.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Turner is a major component of this story, “Know My Name” allows readers a pathway to try and understand what it’s like for the victim going through this type of trauma rather than focusing solely on the rapist himself. And, while sexual assault violence occurs every day, what makes Miller’s case so special is the fact that Turner’s status as an esteemed swimmer immediately drew attention from the media once she decided to press charges.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately, Miller describes reading articles that deliberately painted Turner in this angelic light in which a boy as talented as he could never attempt rape — why, he must have his choice at any girl he wants (note the sarcasm)! Casting her as the “drunk girl” in these articles led to vicious comments in which anonymous people wrote how she was afraid of telling her boyfriend she cheated so she was using rape as an excuse, how she must have wanted it and how she shouldn’t have drank at a frat party without expecting any repercussions. Miller writes, “I didn’t know that if a woman was drunk when the violence occurred, she wouldn’t be taken seriously. I didn’t know that if he was drunk when the violence occurred, people would offer him sympathy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book then goes on to very explicitly describe what it was like for Miller to tell her family members of the assault, to tell her boyfriend and to come to terms with it herself. In trying to escape the torture that came with inconsistent court dates that forced a constant revisiting to her trauma, Miller even moved across the country from Palo Alto to Rhode Island to Philadelphia but still found no stable source of security from the world around her. This kind of moving around and isolation from her peers and family members really exemplified how the pain can truly follow you anywhere you go, despite how far away you may be from your rapist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most gripping and surprising elements of “Know My Name” was the inclusion of transcripts from Turner’s lawyers as well as the testimonials in support of Turner. Miller noted that no one who knew Turner from Stanford testified; only family members and people from his past would be speaking on behalf of who he is now. While Miller was trying to explain why no one should inappropriately touch someone else who is unconscious and thus unable to consent, Turner’s family members were recalling memories of how “sweet” a boy he was. “I wondered if, in their eyes, the victim remained stagnant, living forever in that twenty-minute time frame. She remained frozen, while Brock grew more and more multifaceted, his stories unfolding, a spectrum of life and memories opening up around him. He got to be a person,” Miller wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While, yes, “Know My Name” is just one person’s story, it stands as an example of what many other people have had to go through when similarly sexually assaulted. In a lot of cases, victims are either too afraid to go to the police for help, or when they do, find that there’s a</span><a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very little chance for actual justice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be served to their rapists. Unlike those stories though, Turner was eventually found guilty and sentenced to jail time; however, he only got sentenced six months, which is less than half of the amount that Miller was originally expecting. To this, Miller writes, “The judge had given Brock something that would never be extended to me: empathy. My pain was never more valuable than his potential.” Additionally, this sentencing was cut down even further to only three months due to “good behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, there’s plenty of conclusions that can be drawn from “Know My Name”: the lack of universities enforcing rules and reforms to prevent campus sexual assault, the manipulative ways in which defendant lawyers try to trick victims into saying the wrong thing, the way the victim is always perceived to somehow be at fault, the way society prioritizes rapists for their athletic qualities and potential instead of reprimanding them for their predatory behavior. There’s so much more I could say about what Chanel Miller has so beautifully and tragically crafted into this memoir of hers, but I simply think you should go read it all for yourself. And with this, I leave you with one final quote: “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh but his reputation! That’s really where he suffers.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My advice is, if he’s worried about his reputation, don’t rape anyone.”</span></p><div

In my two years as a news editor, I have been responsible for most, if not all, story pitches regarding students of color, and it has always been a fight to explain why the stories I pitched were necessary, and why the perspective I brought as a person of color to the paper was necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past two years, the few editors of color on staff took it upon ourselves to lead frank discussions within the newsroom, the news team and with leadership about the lack of diversity on staff and what we need to be doing better with our coverage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By no means am I saying that the work I or other editors did was enough — the Nexus has historically failed students of color on this campus, and to say that a few individuals cycling through the office could fix that would be disingenuous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journalism industry at large struggles with these same issues, and without institutional change at the Nexus, and with the high turnover of a college newsroom, nothing will change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organization that demands accountability and transparency from every entity on campus, the Nexus needs to uphold these same standards. After speaking with other journalists of color and from my familiarity with work in other newsrooms, these are a few recommendations that I’m leaving behind. They are by no means the fullest extent of what the Nexus should be doing, but a few places to start. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish yearly or quarterly data on the diversity of the editorial staff.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a formal Diversity and Inclusion Board made up of members of the editorial staff as well as outside representatives. (The Daily Texan has a good reference for a Diversity and Inclusion board </span><a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2019/02/03/introducing-the-texans-raising-voices-initiatives-same-paper-new-commitment-to-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The goal of this board should be to serve as an internal resource for staffers and to oversee diversity initiatives. These should be paid positions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Nexus version of this </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uk0LrP2iM22rY39quqJZBZOstFNAGirJd5KH9hjRAKo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidelines for Inclusive Journalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document from the Seattle Times Diversity &amp; Inclusion Task Force and hold a mandatory staff-wide meeting to distribute it to all current and future editorial staff members and go over the content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate time and resources to doing intentional outreach to students of color and the many student-led organizations on campus that create spaces for students of color. Reach out to student leaders, ask to speak at meetings and open yourself up to feedback and criticism. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertise the opinion section, specifically the op-ed and letter to the editor columns, more broadly and more proactively so that the section reflects a diverse set of voices beyond just its consistent writers. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not enough for the Nexus to just undertake these initiatives to bring more staffers and editors of color into the newsroom. The Nexus, and its white leadership in particular, needs to be more conscientious about how to support these staffers and editors once they join the newsroom, and to listen to what they’re saying, even if it makes them uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus’ white leadership also needs to spend time educating themselves about race, and fostering conversations within the newsroom at large about how students of color are being covered. The newsroom cannot make progress if the Nexus tokenizes the editors of color that are on staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, I really naively thought that the Nexus was immune to the problems that plagued this industry. I know better now, and I ask that the Nexus takes these steps and more to do better for the students of color on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an outgoing editor at the Daily Nexus.

Friends warn friends that C.A.P.S. is understaffed and underfunded. They inform each other that they may not be able to see a therapist for weeks and that some might not get an appointment at all. With the most “at-risk” cases — individuals with either severe mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts — prioritized, it can be difficult to secure a spot for others needing help. These issues cause students like Ace (whose name has been changed for their privacy), to ask if their problems are worth taking a space away from someone else “who might need it more.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rumors about underfunding </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appear to be close to the truth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Regarding wait times, Osimo shares that the period between a student’s Brief Assessment (BA) and appointment varies, with 46% waiting less than 7 days, 27% waiting between 8-14 days and 11% waiting between 18-21 days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C.A.P.S. BA system, wherein a student must drop in to be “assessed” by a C.A.P.S. intake personnel, has been in place for two years. It was developed with the hope that these quick check-ins would increase the number of people C.A.P.S. can help. After this mini-therapy meeting, students with sufficient need are assigned therapy appointments, while others are recommended student groups to attend. Osimo remarks that for the BA, 90% [of students] are seen in less than one hour, 32% of students … in less than 15 minutes. And 12% of students … [are seen in] 45-60 minutes.” But since the BA has to be conducted in person, it has proven to be another area where students find difficulty accessing C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessments are usually conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. Ace remarks that students who are juggling classes and jobs are “screwed” when it comes to matching their schedules to that of C.A.P.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S. closes at 4:30, “and so [during] the times you might be able to go and do one of those intake appointments, [such as] around dinner— [C.A.P.S. is] not there,” Ace said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Osimo acknowledges, “it doesn’t feel good to have to wait when we are dealing with an issue.” So, to try and combat student schedules, C.A.P.S. offers 20 peer group sessions where students come together and share their experiences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> LiveHealth, a new teletherapy service which accepts Student Health insurance, now collaborates with C.A.P.S. to connect students and therapists online (and unlike C.A.P.S and Acacia, does not have long wait times).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “We also know that not everyone needs the same thing,” Osimo continued. “Many students just need one appointment to discuss a specific goal rather than meeting multiple times for therapy.  We offer different options for different needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By acting within their budget, C.A.P.S. has attempted to help the largest amount of students possible — but as history shows they need more funding. C.A.P.S.’ lack of funding </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been an issue since 2006,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the Regents were presented with evidence of rising mental health issues in college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, from 2007-09 counseling programs across the UCs were granted a $12 million budget increase, achieved by raising student fees for two years (this was 28% of the initially requested $43 million dollars). They achieved decreasing the wait period for students to see a professional, but a rise in “the severity of student issues and greater demand for mental health services” continues to be a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in 2011, the University of California’s Office of the President applied for and received a $6.9 million student mental health grant funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA). Each campus was given $500,000, and the UC continued to receive CalMHSA until </span><a href=\"https://saccityexpress.com/gov-brown-vetoes-mental-health-bill-rejects-services-targeting-college-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former Governor Jerry Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vetoed it in 2016 and 2017 because the UC didn’t state an exact amount of money or a source for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2015, the UCs have been increasing student services fees by 5% to address the lack of therapists. Because of this decision, 80% of approved new positions “have been filed across the UC system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, issues like the UC’s inability to offer competitive salaries, recruit diverse talent and maintain consistent state funds have made it difficult to fill the remaining openings. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-detail.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-2020 budget detail</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “additional funds are still needed [to hire more staff].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to work at places that are financially stable. So, to help our students, we need to provide more benefits for our staff.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their experience, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. does a good job of allocating its limited resources. By prioritizing people with serious mental health needs, Ace believes that even if a person is angry that they have been recommended to join a peer group rather than a one-on-one session, it’s important for students to understand that C.AP.S. is trying its best: “You got to trust in the expertise of the person sitting across from you … there’s a reason why they’re suggesting what they’re suggesting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what remains for students is the fear that their problems are not “serious enough for C.A.P.S.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace recalls that they used to convince themselves that they were fine because there were people out there in worse shape than them. “I sit here like, ‘Should I go to C.A.P.S.? No, I shouldn’t go to C.A.P.S. because I’m fine and I’ve never attempted suicide, I’ve only self-harmed a couple of times in my life.’ I’m really not ‘that big of a risk,’” they said, adding air quotes. “But in reality, people have told me several times now, it’s not really about being a big risk — it’s about preventing a big risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ace advises that even though it’s scary, students need to be honest to ensure that they receive proper treatment:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you go into C.A.P.S. and they’re like, ‘Have you experienced any suicidal thoughts?’ do I really want to answer this question, and then I have that moment of ‘should I lie? Should I just be like, “no, everything is fine, it’s all fine?”’ And the most important thing to do is to say [to yourself] ‘No, I’m answering this honestly’ … because at that point, if you start being honest with yourself, the person sitting across the table from you has an ‘oh, fuck’ moment and they then can understand your needs better.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time. Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one of the limitations of C.A.P.S., Ace found, is that their therapy only occurs once every other week and “that model does not work for a lot of people … which is why they try to push people into Acacia and into Santa Barbara [Behavioral Health] clinic … to get them into therapy sessions that are a bit more regular.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than being a place for long term one-on-one therapy, Ace finds that C.A.P.S. works best for those dealing with a mental health crisis. It allocates its resources to helping the most people possible, and the easiest way for them to do that is to act as a place of transition before recommending more long-term options for therapy. However, C.A.P.S.’ lack of traditional therapy is an issue at the heart of student dissatisfaction with the organization. With midterms, the quarter system and the increased likelihood of developing a mental illness in their early twenties, all students deserve the option to speak with a C.A.P.S. therapist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s solution to this problem is simple:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need more money. With the limited resources I don’t know what else they can do … keep putting more and more on them [and] you’re just going to crush them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ace’s ideal for how C.A.P.S. should function involves more therapists, evening hours and the availability of weekly sessions for every student. “[The] world’s going to shit, and everything is on fire — all of the time,” Ace says. “Our brains shouldn’t be having to go to hell while everything else is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ace and I are currently in C.A.P.S. therapy, I have many friends who have “given up” trying to get in. C.A.P.S. is on-campus, takes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student insurance and is a resource promised to us by the university. Demand for mental health care has risen, and while C.A.P.S. is doing its best to help everyone, they need more. Our campus needs more.

Now, with COVID-19, housing insecurity is an even scarier reality. The shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders will not keep us safe if we cannot stay housed.
