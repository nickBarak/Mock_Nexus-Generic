As a first-timer at Muddy Waters Coffee House, which is just a mile away from the bustling excitement of State Street, I immediately felt at home. Its dim lighting, art-filled walls, funky light fixtures and vintage couches gave the venue a cozy and relaxed feel. Enthusiastic members from all over the Santa Barbara and greater SoCal area welcomed the two Cali-based bands to the scene last Friday night, Oct. 17 as a part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>YELLOW RED SPARKS</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57737\" style=\"width: 355px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"712349381\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57737\" data-attachment-id=\"57737\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/yellow-red-sparks-1012-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1337478691\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57737\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=345%2C230\" alt=\"Courtesy of wptsradio.com\" width=\"345\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>wptsradio.com</em></p></div>\n<p>The first band, Yellow Red Sparks, is a four-piece collective from Irvine, Calif., composed of Joshua Hanson (vocals/songwriter/guitar), Darren “Goldy” Goldstein (drums), Sarah Lynn Nishikawa (bass) and Mike Harris (keyboard).

This tune quickly drew in a crowd to the main area of the coffee shop, with attendees bopping their heads and swaying their bodies to the rhythm. Slowing down the mood of the locale, their second song “Buy Me Honey” revealed a more melodramatic theme. They continued to play songs off their self-titled album, including the popular “Scents and Sensibility” and “Monsters with Misdemeanors,” as well as new songs not yet released.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the show was their rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Hanson asked the audience to sing along to “help break some ice,” which ended up bringing the crowd even closer together. The combination of Hanson’s dulcet voice with the melodic group vocals of the audience created a beautiful and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The band’s cinematic/indie folk tunes and sentimental melodies fused together to produce uplifting and heartfelt anthems. Their fun stage presence also added to the intimacy of the set, making me feel lucky that I was able to be a part of something so inimitable. Closing out with a song titled “Seven Seas,” which the group announced will be coming out next month, the Yellow Red Sparks left a positive vibe behind in Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p>After their set, I caught up with them on the sidewalk outside of the venue. When I asked how Yellow Red Sparks came to be, they had an interesting story to tell. “Basically, I was just doing coffee shop stuff and Goldy took some of my songs and added drums to it,” Hanson explained. From there, Goldy introduced Hanson to Nishikawa, an upright bass player who Goldy was teaching drums to at the time. The trio formed a band, and later added the fourth member, Mike, who the group affectionately calls the “newbie.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the significance of their band name, Hanson laid out the dynamics for me. “The band name initially comes from our song entitled ‘Yellow Red Sparks,’ which is also a part of our self-titled album. To me, the phrase means passion, with the mellow color of yellow colliding with the vibrant color of red.”</p>\n<p>Adding to this comment, Goldy mentioned that “the term mirrors the emotional push-and-pull that comes with relationships — both the loving and the heated parts.” These opposite emotions, which we all can identify with, were felt through the set as their songs encompassed expressions of both joy and melancholy as a way to meticulously depict all realities of what it means to be human. I could sense this up-and-down pattern as the band moved from song to song, feeling hopeful through one moment and feeling somber through the other.</p>\n<p>These ideas tie in with the main themes of the band’s lyrics. “Our songs are about human stuff,” said Hanson in a whimsical manner. “They’re all about struggling with relationships and the challenge of maintaining faith and hope throughout it all. I like to call it the human struggle.”</p>\n<p>I could tell that Hanson was deep in his thoughts by the way he stared at the concrete beneath him, hands in his pockets. For a second he collected his thoughts, a slight frown on his forehead. Suddenly he looked up and continued, “The goal for us is to affect people with music. We don’t just want it to be something that people bop their heads to, but to be something that makes people feel something.”</p>\n<p>A genuine look on his face, Hanson left me with this message: “We want to connect with people and take that as far as we can, whether that’s to a hundred people or to thousands of people. As cliché as it sounds, we just want to change people’s lives through music.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57739\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1148114756\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57739\" data-attachment-id=\"57739\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/kinds/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"479,319\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kinds\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57739\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=356%2C236\" alt=\"Courtesy of independent.com\" width=\"356\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?w=479&amp;ssl=1 479w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57739\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>independent.com</em></p></div>\n<p>THE KINDS</p>\n<p>The headlining band, The Kinds, is a local group from Santa Barbara, Calif. Formed by Khasy Modisette (vocals/guitar), Nathan Modisette (bass), Anders Bergstrom (guitar/back-up vocals) and Erich Riedl (drums), the band hit the sweet spot for many locals and non-locals that have been anticipating the performance for months. While the band has played the New Noise Festival before, this was their first time headlining for the event.</p>\n<p>They opened their performance with one of their most popular songs, “Been a Long Time.” This song combined the soothing rhythm of the guitar with the compelling female vocals of the lead singer, which immediately set a warm tone for the show. Elements of indie, folk, rock and country were apparent throughout their songs, fascinating the crowd with irresistible forms of musicianship that nobody could quite walk away from.</p>\n<p>While their set included emotionally-striking songs that were a little on the slow side, they also included high-energy tunes that got the whole crowd to dance. The faster songs included empowering guitar solos and catchy melodies, while the slower ones transformed the venue into a wistful scene. While every song was unique on its own, each tune brought out romantic and heart-felt themes about love and equality.</p>\n<p>The showmanship of the combo also created a folksy mood that perfectly complimented the relaxed feel of the coffee shop. Band members smiled often, sipping on beers. They even described one of their songs, entitled “Runaway”, as a “beer drinking song,” and quickly turned this anecdote into a drinking game by encouraging the crowd to take a sip from their brews during certain lyrics.</p>\n<p>I stuck around after their set and had a chance to interview Modisette and Bergstrom as they were packing up their equipment. The lead lady singer told me about the creation of The Kinds, which sprang to life about five years ago. “Nate and I were playing together for a while when one of our close friends introduced us to Erich. Out of the blue, Anders showed up and starting playing with us,” said Modisette. “It all worked together really well, and the creation of the band was just kind of instant.”</p>\n<p>From there, The Kinds have focused on playing local shows with more casual intentions. “Part of the reason why I love playing with this ensemble is that everybody is on a professional level, but we just do it for fun,” explained Bergstrom with a gleeful look on his face. “This is our passion, and being able to play and have a great time doing it is really why we’re here.” From what I could tell, the convivial response from their close-knit Santa Barbara supporters is all The Kinds really need.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other bands, The Kinds have no desire to get signed. Apart from having daytime jobs and families to take care of, they come together as a band to focus most of their attention on enjoying the act of music-making. In regards to making it big, however, getting signed is one of their last priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost not even a consideration. It just doesn’t seem like us,” said Modisette. Nodding his head, Bergstrom laughably commented that each member comes “from different facets of the music industry, and there was this interesting moment that we realized that we could be as good as anybody but not be as stressed as everybody else.” All in all, The Kinds are just a good-hearted, small-town band who wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>As the night came to a close, it was certain that The Kinds’ nonchalant take on music and folksy tunes had once more left a warm impression on the guests of Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_haD3tnFRKo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/","id":7077,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7076,7075,7074],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto","biography":"Not available","articles":[7005,7034,7040,7077,7633],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Creature Carnival ft.

Each distinct, genre-bending act has been said to take attendees deeper into a musical journey culminating with the Carnival’s star, Beats Antique.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Comprised of frontman, producer and multi-instrument connoisseur David Satori, belly-dancing beauty Zoe Jakes and drummer Tommy Cappel, Beats Antique is infamous for delivering an otherworldly experience bringing together the futuristic beats of modern electronic music with the artistic and spiritual stylings of ancient music from the Eastern hemisphere and beyond. Frequenting festivals across the country such as Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and Lollapalooza, dancetronica trio Beats Antique personally selected likeminded artists to perform along with them during the Creature Carnival tour.</p>\n<p>Shpongle’s strange, surreal and dreamy and ephemeral soundscapes are truly a trip, whether you’re on one or not. Known to be a pioneer in the psybient electronic music festival scene, Shpongle’s music has seen a growing fan base among not only American arts and music festival-goers but also in Europe, Israel and pockets of Asia. With musical influences spanning the globe, Shpongle’s mix of live instrumentation (i.e., flute arrangements) with electronic sonic textures makes for a perfect accompaniment to the multi-sensory stylings of Beats Antique.</p>\n<p>The Portland-based electronic producer hailing from New York, Douglas Appling, a.k.a Emancipator, has been famous among experimental electronic music fans for his soulful integrations of raw hip-hop and melodious symphonic layers for several years now. Frequently accompanied by live violin playing from Ilya Goldberg, Emancipator’s music is a mix of dope beats and ethereal melodies guaranteed to move your heart and your feet.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, Lafa Taylor is an up-and-coming hip-hop rapper, singer and producer based in Oakland with a penchant for heavy bass and gritty beats coupled with experimental electronic tunes and inspiring, activating lyrics. With his performance style featuring melodic choruses, intricate rhymes, beat-boxing and live-looping, Lafa Taylor’s performance is likely to be a dope addition to the Carnival’s night of musical wonder and mystique.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To buy tickets, go to <i>creaturecarnival.net.</i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/_SA_kvN3pVkframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_SA_kvN3pVk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58060\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58060\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-07/preview-creature-carnival-in-la-ft-beats-antique/","id":7074,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[7073,7072,7071],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Six Celebrities Who Love Kanye West More Than He Loves Himself (Maybe)","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Yeezy, Ye, Mr. West, Dr. Martin Louie the King Jr. and my personal favorite, Yeezus.

We’ve heard them all. No matter what you call him, Kanye West is a musical force to be reckoned with — and he knows it! With seven hit albums, a knockout wife and an unbeatable presence in the fashion industry, it’s no wonder Kanye’s ego is as big as his career. Thought Kanye was his own biggest fan? Well here are six stars that will compete for that title:</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Florence Welch (of Florence + the Machine) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This redheaded vocal goddess, whose hit song is featured in the 2013 rendition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, is excited “over the love” she has for fellow musical artist Kanye West. After gushing when realizing he was front row at one of her shows and partying it up with Mr. West in New Zealand, Welch has made it clear that she’s a fan. The two musical sensations have yet to collaborate on an album but I’m sure she wouldn’t oppose to joining his “clique.”</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Jonah Hill </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Few people remember the video that hit the web back in 2008 of Jonah and Yeezy playing an old-fashioned game of Connect Four. The two stars hit it off and made jokes about each other while Jonah was annihilated by Kanye’s board game skills. Both guys seemed thrilled just to share laughs with each other and Hill took his loss like a man as Kanye performed a victory dance to his own music. Way to “watch the throne” Yeezy!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Kylie Jenner</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Seventeen-year-old Kylie Jenner isn’t just a fan of Kanye, she’s his new sister-in-law!

Kim K’s little sis took to social media to show us her extensive collection of “The Yeezus Tour” merchandise and her imitation of his infamous diamond-masked look with ski masks.

The number one fan of Kanye West is none other than his wife and the mother of his child, Mrs. Kim Kardashian West. The two stars have shared their scandals in the past, but together they have found love and created a beautiful family. She’s attended more performances and supported more dreams than any other Kanye West fan. She has stood by him when the media sought to destroy him, and held his hand through his injuries and illness. Kim K has proven that even Mr. West needs his Mrs. West.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Sure, he may be a self-proclaimed genius who refers to himself as a deity, but he’s got talent that can’t be ignored (not even by other celebrities). He may not be able to walk on water but he sure knows how to create a following.</p>\n<p><em>Jessica Gresham has Ye fever. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The term “block party” can be interpreted quite literally here, seeing as the party occupied only about one block’s worth of space. Although small in size, the mini-fest — which had Ghost Beach, FMLYBND, Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Gibbz and Cherub on the bill — had a lot to offer its attendees.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57756\" style=\"width: 244px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1497936279\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57751\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57756\" data-attachment-id=\"57756\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/13951921480_dd20b8da8c/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"13951921480_dd20b8da8c\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57756\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?resize=234%2C156\" alt=\"The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Courtesy of blog.kexp.org\" width=\"234\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13951921480_dd20b8da8c.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57756\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Courtesy of <em>blog.kexp.org</em></p></div>\n<p>From vendors with unique artisan wears to a beer garden with the option to do a “silent disco,” there was no shortage of entertainment between the artists’ sets. The line of vendors was diverse enough to provide something for everyone. There were a few merchandise stands selling crystal gem jewelry and feathery headbands, while Lucidity had a booth for those looking to buy some true bohemian garb.</p>\n<p>Because of Hope, a nonprofit that raises money for Uganda by selling their handmade goods, had a stand and, while they refrained from solicitation (thank god), they were on hand to educate passers-by about their mission. Art from Scrap, a local organization that keeps reusable art materials donated from resident businesses, provided a station where people could stop and make themselves a headband or bracelet for free.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Adjacent to the vendors there was a small food court with a seated area set against the backdrop of live mural paintings. Inspired by a girl painting a sea creature on what appeared to be a large dumpster, a few other artists started to set up shop and paint away for all to politely observe. Past the artisan popsicle stand and a wood-fired pizza oven, there lay the quintessential taco truck with three tacos for $5, making the meager food selection A-okay in my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>Between the live mural paintings, silent disco and local art vendors, the New Noise Block Party held strong elements of DIY, and the atmosphere was largely created by the attendees. People did not simply show up to see Cherub (okay, maybe some did), but also to interact within the community and truly see what the Santa Barbara art world has to offer.</p>\n<p>The harmonious nature of the mini-fest manifested itself when Kip, lead singer of rock-pop band The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, amicably handed me a free CD when I mentioned that I would unfortunately be missing their set. The sense of community reminded me that the Block Party was just as much about the local artists and networking in Santa Barbara as it was about the performances themselves. Although sometimes overshadowed by the bar scene, downtown Santa Barbara has a very conscious artistic community. New Noise Conference and Music Festival perfectly embodied this realm. The Block Party seamlessly concluded a weekend of music, education, networking and just plain ol’ good times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/XlZtvEM5mf4frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XlZtvEM5mf4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/new-noise-block-party-highlights-the-santa-barbara-artist-community-bringing-good-times-and-diy-to-the-funk-zone/","id":7076,"author":{"id":760,"name":"Jasmine Salvino"},"related":[7075,7074,7073],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
