In the top of the eighth, Checketts visited the mound only to leave Jacome in to face a lefty batter with runners on second and third. With another allowed walk to load the bases, Jacome got out of the inning after junior first baseman Brandon Cuddy flied out with a line drive to senior left fielder Cameron Newell.</p>\n<p>“[Checketts] told me that this was my guy, and unfortunately though I walked him, I was doing the best I could,” Jacome said. “I wanted the next guy even more, and that out was a huge out for us.”</p>\n<p>Jacome’s win marked a bounce-back game from his loss against Kentucky last weekend. In his 8.1 innings pitched against the Ducks, he recorded his second win of the season with 10 strikeouts. Being passed the baton in the ninth, junior righty reliever James Carter came in for his fourth save. Carter maintains a 0.00 ERA through 7.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>“I needed this confidence booster,” Jacome said. “Everything was working for me — my sliders and my change ups. I’m not big on striking out guys, I usually try to get the pop-ups and ground balls, but I was getting the strikeouts [Sunday].”</p>\n<p>Newell preformed at the plate on Sunday, scoring the only run of the game with his second homer of the season to deep right field off of the Duck’s starting pitcher, senior right-hander Jack Karraker. Karraker pitched through six and allowed three hits to the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I got a really good swing off,” Newell said. “Thing’s weren’t really going great for us this weekend and I didn’t think one run was going to separate this game, but Jacome did an outstanding job and was the reason we won the game.”</p>\n<p>Though the series ended in a Gaucho win, the Ducks posed as a strong competitor taking two games and the advantage in the series. In his start on Saturday, sophomore righty Shane Bieber fell victim to Oregon’s offensive strength as the Ducks dominated 11-3.</p>\n<p>“Even though Bieber got beat up [on Saturday], I still think he executed fine. He had a couple weird innings, but he gave us a chance,” Checketts said. “We’ve still got the ‘seventh and eighth inning’ issue where we still don’t really know what we’re going to do.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, five Ducks recorded RBIs and Cuddy racked up seven of a total 11 team RBIs with a triple and a home run. The Duck’s starter freshman lefty David Peterson pitched through six innings and allowed only four hits to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This is a gut-check series for us, losing the first two and coming back [Sunday],” Newell said. “It showed how tough we are, and our ability to bounce back forward for the rest of the season.”</p>\n<p>Junior righty Dillon Tate took the mound in the series-opening 5-1 Oregon win, and recorded his first loss of the season. Tate shutout Oregon through five innings, allowed one run in the sixth and two in the seventh. He ends the weekend with a 1.29 season ERA.</p>\n<p>“[Tate] was outstanding,” Checketts said. “He looked like a bonafide All-American starter.”</p>\n<p>Tate’s solid start was not enough to secure a Gaucho win, as freshman shortstop Clay Fisher was the Gauchos’ only run in Friday’s game, and was driven in by sophomore leadoff hitter and center fielder Andrew Calica. Oregon’s Friday pitchers held the UCSB offense to only five hits.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we’ve got to go to work, our team batting average probably dropped over fifty points this weekend and we have to be able to have better at-bats against quality pitching,” Checketts said. “We have to even up our strokes. We’ve gotten too many backwards ‘K’s,’ where we haven’t been swinging with two strikes. That’s just one of the learning experiences.”</p>\n<p>The team will host the Pac 12 league leader, and undefeated USC as the Trojans travels to Santa Barbara for a one-game appearance at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium on Tuesday at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/santa-barbara-overmatched-at-home-against-oregon/","id":4398,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4397,4396,4395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers","biography":"Not available","articles":[1411,1941,4219,4347,4348,4350,4377,4378,4379,4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4391,4396,4397,4398,4399,4401,4402,4436,4718,4720,4727,4729,4730,4731,4732,4733,4734,4735,4736,4737,4738,4743,4751,4752,4756,4759,4760,4950,4963,5122,5164,5167,5173,5192,5195,5197,5198,5208,5211,5213,5214,5218,5220,5294,5297,5298,5311,5314],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Lawsuit Dismissed Alleging CSD Inappropriately Discussed Financial Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Gabriel Pragin, community organizer and ex-candidate for the I.V.

The two parties began discussions to settle the lawsuit at the end of July. He ultimately filed to dismiss the lawsuit on Oct. 13, and the court accepted the dismissal on Oct. 16, according to the Santa Barbara County online court record database.</p>\n<p>In the lawsuit, Pragin alleges that the CSD’s Formation Committee discussed financial revenue, such as grants and donations, when it was only authorized to discuss the CSD’s financial structure, such as banking.</p>\n<p>A charter is a document listing what a committee may discuss during its meetings.</p>\n<p>Pragin said he set three conditions for dismissing the lawsuit during the negotiation process.</p>\n<p>The first is that the scope of the Formation Committee’s work be defined more clearly in its charter. According to the CSD’s lawyer G. Ross Trindle, the CSD addressed this concern by signing Resolution 17-1 on July 11 with a unanimous vote of the board.</p>\n<p>The resolution outlines the CSD subcommittees’ roles, including the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>The resolution added the ability to find sources for funding to the committee’s powers.</p>\n<p>“That resolution, in my mind, addressed the … concerns that Mr. Pragin’s complaint attempted to raise,” Trindle said in an email.</p>\n<p>The second condition Pragin requested when dismissing the lawsuit is a statement from the board recognizing that they violated the Formation Committee’s initial charter.</p>\n<p>Trindle said the CSD plans to make a statement on the lawsuit at the next regularly scheduled board meeting on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>Pragin’s last request before dismissing the case was to recuperate the costs he suffered from the litigation.</p>\n<p>He said he spent approximately $1,200 pursuing the lawsuit against the district.</p>\n<p>Pragin dismissed the cases without receiving compensation; he lost eligibility to have his costs reimbursed when he decided to represent himself in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>According to federal law, if a person representing themselves in court is not a lawyer they are unable to be awarded attorney’s fees if they win their case.</p>\n<p>Pragin told the <em>Nexus</em> he attempted to address the alleged violations at the Formation Committee’s public meeting but said all the committee members agreed he was incorrect in his claims against the district.</p>\n<p>He said he felt the committee did not take his claims seriously.</p>\n<p>“I stopped feeling like a constituent of theirs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trindle said in an email he thought it was “unfortunate” that Pragin felt his only option was filing a lawsuit but said it is important that the district can now focus on improving I.V. for its residents.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday evening that he and the other board members are committed to the importance of transparency and public participation.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman recused himself from all closed sessions discussing the lawsuit to avoid a possible conflict of interest stemming from his long-term friendship. Pragin also served as Freeman’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-14/three-final-candidates-join-race-for-office-in-isla-vista/\">“campaign philosopher”</a> for the 2016 Santa Barbara County Supervisor race.</p>\n<p>In addition to the lawsuit, Pragin said he has also served the district and its subcommittees with three letters citing violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the law that sets the rules for open meetings of government boards and the communications between board members.</p>\n<p>According to Pragin, two of the complaints were answered and corrected and one was answered and disputed.</p>\n<p>Two of the alleged violations were served in April and the other in May.</p>\n<p>One of his letters dated April 20 claimed the CSD illegally created an ad hoc committee by making a committee that discussed “continuing subject matter jurisdiction,” arguing that the contents the committee discussed made it ineligible to be ad hoc.</p>\n<p>Bertrand responded in a letter a month later saying the board rescinded the action that first created the ad hoc committee and passed a new motion that created it once more with a more fitting description of its powers.</p>\n<p>The second letter, also dated April 20, alleged directors George Thurlow and Bob Geis had a side conversation during a regular board meeting of the CSD to plan their next meeting of the Formation Committee.</p>\n<p>Geis, chair of the Formation Committee, disputed the claim in a letter stating the committee did not believe the action warranted a commitment to cease and desist and that such an action would lead to a “burdensome limitation.”</p>\n<p>The letter dated May 9 claimed members of the Formation Committee failed to publicly notice, adjourn or show up to a public meeting.</p>\n<p>Geis responded in a letter a week later stating the committee “unconditionally commits” to ceasing, desisting and refusing to repeat the offense Pragin stated in his letter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They are just another team to us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s head coach Andrew Checketts has a rich history with the Oregon coaching staff, as Checketts was an assistant coach under Oregon Head Coach George Horton for four years. The two teams have not faced each other since Checketts began his career at UCSB in the 2011-2012 season.<br>\n“There is a little bit of a coaching ‘family tree’ that I am a branch off of their head coach,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>The Ducks were ranked in NCAA pre-season polls by Collegiate Baseball as one place above the Gauchos, coming in at No. 15 to UCSB’s No. 16. This series will be the first time the Ducks have been on the road since their season-opening series.<br>\n“We’re at home and we traditionally play better at home, so we have that built-in advantage,” Checketts said. “We’ve got a decent amount of momentum going into this weekend as well. It’s a good chance for an exciting series, and a good test for both teams. It’s going to be a good measuring stick to where we both are at.”<br>\nAfter junior lefty Domenic Mazza’s start against Pepperdine on Tuesday, the Gauchos have sophomore righty Shane Bieber, Tate and junior lefty Justin Jacome as potential starters for this weekend’s series. Of the three, Bieber has accounted for the most innings pitched at 16, followed by Tate with 13.2 and Jacome at 10.2.<br>\nTate has still maintained a 0.00 earned run average through his two wins pitched in two appearances and he also leads the pitching staff in strikeouts, recording 17.<br>\n“I’m never in anything by myself because it’s a team effort. There’s eight other people on the field,” Tate said. “I think the pitching staff will do well. We’ve continued to work hard so we feel prepared.”</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Ducks, junior righty Conor Harber leads the team with two wins. In his 11 innings pitched, he has recorded 12 strikeouts and has also maintained a 0.00 earned run average.</p>\n<p>Up to face Oregon’s defensive challenge for the Gauchos is junior designated hitter Robby Nesovic. The junior infielder is leading the team in RBIs with 10 in eight games played. He also has 14 hits, coming in with a .483 average.</p>\n<p>Behind him is senior outfielder Cameron Newell, who also has 14 hits this season and has accounted for 13 of the 56 total Gaucho runs. “Based off what I’ve seen in practice and in games, I feel the team has been playing decent,” Tate said. “Some things we need to improve on are just backing each other up and not getting down on ourselves when things get tough.”</p>\n<p>Oregon has recorded 53 runs in the past six games. A big hitter for the Ducks is junior infielder Matt Eureste, who leads the team in both batting average and total hits and has one home run this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will kick off the series at home on Friday at 2 p.m., followed by another mid-day game on Saturday at 2 p.m., and will wrap it up on Sunday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 26, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/baseball-welcomes-oregon-for-three-game-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/baseball-welcomes-oregon-for-three-game-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/baseball-welcomes-oregon-for-three-game-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/baseball-welcomes-oregon-for-three-game-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/baseball-welcomes-oregon-for-three-game-series/","id":4396,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4395,4394,4393],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pick Up First Road Win Over Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB continues its hot start and improves to an impressive 7-1 with its latest win","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61296\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150213_baseball_vsBYU_02-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1033331957\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61307\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61296\" data-attachment-id=\"61296\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/gauchos-pick-up-first-road-win-over-pepperdine/jj-muno-attempts-to-bunt-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150213_baseball_vsBYU_02-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1020&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1020\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"JJ Muno attempts to bunt.
